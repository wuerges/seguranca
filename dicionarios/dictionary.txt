Nedroid Picture Diary by Anthony Clark, http://nedroid.com

Movies and TV shows always make hacking look exciting with furious typing and meaningless
ones and zeros flying across the screen. They make hacking look like something that you have to
be super smart to learn. They make hacking look like magic.
It’s not magic. It’s based on computers, and everything computers do have logical
principles behind them which can be learned and understood. Even when you don’t
understand or when the computer does something frustrating or mysterious, there is always,
always, always a reason why.
And it’s not hard to learn. This book assumes you know nothing about cryptography or
programming, and helps you learn, step by step, how to write programs that can hack encrypted
messages. Good luck and have fun!

Dedicated to Aaron Swartz, 1986 – 2013

“Aaron was part of an army of citizens that believes democracy
only works when the citizenry are informed, when we know about
our rights—and our obligations. An army that believes we must
make justice and knowledge available to all—not just the well born
or those that have grabbed the reins of power—so that we may
govern ourselves more wisely.
When I see our army, I see Aaron Swartz and my heart is broken.
We have truly lost one of our better angels.”
- C.M.

ABOUT THIS BOOK
There are many books that teach beginners how to write secret messages using ciphers. There are
a couple books that teach beginners how to hack ciphers. As far as I can tell, there are no books to
teach beginners how to write programs to hack ciphers. This book fills that gap.
This book is for complete beginners who do not know anything about encryption, hacking, or
cryptography. The ciphers in this book (except for the RSA cipher in the last chapter) are all
centuries old, and modern computers now have the computational power to hack their encrypted
messages. No modern organization or individuals use these ciphers anymore. As such, there’s no
reasonable context in which you could get into legal trouble for the information in this book.
This book is for complete beginners who have never programmed before. This book teaches basic
programming concepts with the Python programming language. Python is the best language for
beginners to learn programming: it is simple and readable yet also a powerful programming
language used by professional software developers. The Python software can be downloaded for
free from http://python.org and runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, and the Raspberry Pi.
There are two definitions of “hacker”. A hacker is a person who studies a system (such as the
rules of a cipher or a piece of software) to understand it so well that they are not limited by the
original rules of that system and can creatively modify it to work in new ways. “Hacker” is also
used to mean criminals who break into computer systems, violate people’s privacy, and cause
damage. This book uses “hacker” in the first sense. Hackers are cool. Criminals are just people
who think they’re being clever by breaking stuff. Personally, my day job as a software
developer pays me way more for less work than writing a virus or doing an Internet scam would.
On a side note, don’t use any of the encryption programs in this book for your actual files.
They’re fun to play with but they don’t provide true security. And in general, you shouldn’t trust
the ciphers that you yourself make. As legendary cryptographer Bruce Schneier put it, “Anyone,
from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself
can’t break. It’s not even hard. What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break,
even after years of analysis. And the only way to prove that is to subject the algorithm to years of
analysis by the best cryptographers around.”
This book is released under a Creative Commons license and is free to copy and distribute (as
long as you don’t charge money for it). The book can be downloaded for free from its website at

The text on the left side is a secret message. The message has been encrypted, or turned into a
secret code. It will be completely unreadable to anyone who doesn’t know how to decrypt it
(that is, turn it back into the plain English message.) This book will teach you how to encrypt and
decrypt messages.
The message on the right is just random gibberish with no hidden meaning whatsoever.
Encrypting your written messages is one way to keep them secret from other people, even if they
get their hands on the encrypted message itself. It will look exactly like random nonsense.

Cryptography is the science of using secret codes. A cryptographer is someone who uses and
studies secret codes. This book will teach you what you need to know to become a cryptographer.
Of course, these secret messages don’t always stay secret. A cryptanalyst is someone who can
hack secret codes and read other people’s encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts are also called code
breakers or hackers. This book will also teach you what you need to know to become a
cryptanalyst. Unfortunately the type of hacking you learn in this book isn’t dangerous enough to
get you in trouble with the law. (I mean, fortunately.)
Spies, soldiers, hackers, pirates, royalty, merchants, tyrants, political activists, Internet shoppers,
and anyone who has ever needed to share secrets with trusted friends have relied on cryptography
to make sure their secrets stay secret.

Codes vs. Ciphers
The development of the electric telegraph in the early 19th century allowed for near-instant
communication through wires across continents. This was much faster than sending a horseback
rider carrying a bag of letters. However, the telegraph couldn’t directly send written letters drawn
on paper. Instead it could send electric pulses. A short pulse is called a “dot” and a long pulse is
called a “dash”.

Figure 1-1. Samuel Morse
April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872
In order to convert these dots and dashes to
English letters of the alphabet, an encoding
system (or code) is needed to translate from
English to electric pulse code (called
encoding) and at the other end translate
electric pulses to English (called decoding).
The code to do this over telegraphs (and later,
radio) was called Morse Code, and was
developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail.
By tapping out dots and dashes with a onebutton telegraph, a telegraph operator could
communicate an English message to someone
on the other side of the world almost instantly!

Codes are made to be understandable and publicly available. Anyone should be able to look
up what a code’s symbols mean to decode an encoded message.

Making a Paper Cipher Wheel
Before we learn how to program computers to do encryption and decryption for us, let’s learn
how to do it ourselves with simple paper tools. It is easy to turn the understandable English text
(which is called the plaintext) into the gibberish text that hides a secret code (called the

ciphertext). A cipher is a set of rules for converting between plaintext and ciphertext. These
rules often use a secret key. We will learn several different ciphers in this book.
Let’s learn a cipher called the Caesar cipher. This cipher was used by Julius Caesar two thousand
years ago. The good news is that it is simple and easy to learn. The bad news is that because it is
so simple, it is also easy for a cryptanalyst to break it. But we can use it as a simple learning
exercise. More information about the Caesar cipher is given on Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher.
To convert plaintext to ciphertext using the Caesar cipher, we will create something called a
cipher wheel (also called a cipher disk). You can either photocopy the cipher wheel that
appears in this book, or print out the one from http://invpy.com/cipherwheel. Cut out the two
circles and lay them on top of each other like in Figure 1-8.

After you cut out the circles, place the smaller one in the middle of the larger one. Put a pin or
brad through the center of both circles so you can spin them around in place. You now have a tool
for creating secret messages with the Caesar cipher.

A Virtual Cipher Wheel
There is also a virtual cipher wheel online if you
don’t have scissors and a photocopier handy.
Open a web browser to
http://invpy.com/cipherwheel to use the software
version of the cipher wheel.
To spin the wheel around, click on it with the
mouse and then move the mouse cursor around
until the key you want is in place. Then click the
mouse again to stop the wheel from spinning.

Figure 1-9. The online cipher wheel.

How to Encrypt with the Cipher Wheel
First, write out your message in English on paper. For this example we will encrypt the message,
“The secret password is Rosebud.” Next, spin the inner wheel around until its letters match up
with letters in the outer wheel. Notice in the outer wheel there is a dot next to the letter A. Look at
the number in the inner wheel next to the dot in the outer wheel. This number is known the
encryption key.
The encryption key is the secret to encrypting or decrypting the message. Anyone who reads this
book can learn about the Caesar cipher, just like anyone who reads a book about locks can learn
how a door lock works. But like a regular lock and key, unless they have the encryption key, they
will not be able to unlock (that is, decrypt) the secret encrypted message. In Figure 1-9, the outer
circle’s A is over the inner circle’s number 8. That means we will be using the key 8 to encrypt
our message. The Caesar cipher uses the keys from 0 to 25. Let’s use the key 8 for our example.
Keep the encryption key a secret; the ciphertext can be read by anyone who knows that the
message was encrypted with key 8.

↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
X I A A E W Z L

R O S E B U D .
↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
Z W A M J C L .

For each letter in our message, we will find where it is in the outer circle and replace it with the
lined-up letter in the inner circle. The first letter in our message is T (the first “T” in “The
secret…”), so we find the letter T in the outer circle, and then find the lined-up letter in the inner
circle. This letter is B, so in our secret message we will always replace T’s with B’s. (If we were
using some other encryption key besides 8, then the T’s in our plaintext would be replaced with a
different letter.)
The next letter in our message is H, which turns into P. The letter E turns into M. When we have
encrypted the entire message, the message has transformed from “The secret password is
Rosebud.” to “Bpm amkzmb xiaaewzl qa Zwamjcl.” Now you can send this message to someone
(or keep it written down for yourself) and nobody will be able to read it unless you tell them the
secret encryption key (the number 8).

Figure 1-10. A message encrypted with the cipher wheel.
Each letter on the outer wheel will always be encrypted to the same letter on the inner wheel. To
save time, after you look up the first T in “The secret…” and see that it encrypts to B, you can
replace every T in the message with B. This way you only need to look up a letter once.

How to Decrypt with the Cipher Wheel
To decrypt a ciphertext, go from the inner circle to the outer circle. Let’s say you receive this
ciphertext from a friend, “Iwt ctl ephhldgs xh Hldgsuxhw.” You and everyone else won’t be able
to decrypt it unless you know the key (or unless you are a clever hacker). But your friend has
decided to use the key 15 for each message she sends you.
Line up the letter A on the outer circle (the one with the dot below it) over the letter on the inner
circle that has the number 15 (which is the letter P). The first letter in the secret message is I, so
we find I on the inner circle and look at the letter next to it on the outer circle, which is T. The W
in the ciphertext will decrypt to the letter H. One by one, we can decrypt each letter in the
ciphertext back to the plaintext, “The new password is Swordfish.”

If we use an incorrect key like 16 instead of the correct key 15, the decrypted message is “Sgd
mdv ozrrvnqc hr Rvnqcehrg.” This plaintext doesn’t look plain at all. Unless the correct key is
used, the decrypted message will never be understandable English.

A Different Cipher Tool: The St. Cyr Slide
There’s another paper tool that can be used to do encryption and
decryption, called the St. Cyr slide. It’s like the cipher wheel
except in a straight line.
Photocopy the image of the St. Cyr slide on the following page (or
print it out from http://invpy.com/stcyrslide) and cut out the three
strips.
Tape the two alphabet strips together, with the black box A next to
the white box Z on the other strip. Cut out the slits on either side of
the main slide box so that the taped-together strip can feed through
it. It should look like this:

Figure 1-12. The completed St. Cyr Slide
When the black box A is underneath the letter H (and the number
7), then to encrypt you must find where the plaintext letter is on
the long strip, and replace it with the letter above it. To decrypt,
find the ciphertext letter on the top row of letters and replace it
with the letter on the long strip below it.
The two slits on the larger box will hide any extra letters so that
you only see one of each letter on the slide for any key.
The benefit of the St. Cyr slide is that it might be easier to find the
letters you are looking for, since they are all in a straight line and
will never be upside down like they sometimes are on the cipher
wheel.

these strips to make a St.
Cyr Slide.

Don’t ignore the practice exercises!
There isn’t enough room in this book to put in all the practice
exercises, but they’re still important.
You don’t become a hacker by just reading about hacking and
programming. You have to actually do it!

Doing Cryptography without Paper Tools
The cipher wheel and St. Cyr slide are nice tools to do encryption and decryption with the Caesar
cipher. But we can implement the Caesar cipher with just pencil and paper.
Write out the letters of the alphabet from A to Z with the numbers from 0 to 25 under each letter.
0 goes underneath the A, 1 goes under the B, and so on until 25 is under Z. (There are 26 letters
in the alphabet, but our numbers only go up to 25 because we started at 0, not 1.) It will end up
looking something like this:
A
0

With the above letters-to-numbers code, we can use numbers to represent letters. This is a very
powerful concept, because math uses numbers. Now we have a way to do math on letters.
Now to encrypt we find the number under the letter we wish to encrypt and add the key number
to it. This sum will be the number under the encrypted letter. For example, we encrypt, “Hello.
How are you?” with the key 13. First we find the number under the H, which is 7. Then we add
the key to this number. 7 + 13 = 20. The number 20 is under the letter U, which means the letter
H encrypts to the letter U. To encrypt the letter E, we add the 4 under E to 13 to get 17. The
number above 17 is R, so E gets encrypted to R. And so on.
This works fine until we get to the letter O. The number under O is 14. But when we add 14 + 13
we get 27. But our list of numbers only goes up to 25. If the sum of the letter’s number and the

12

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

key is 26 or more, we should subtract 26 from it. So 27 – 26 is 1. The letter above the number 1 is
B. So the letter O encrypts to the letter B when we are using the key 13. One by one, we can then
encrypt the letters in, “Hello. How are you?” to “Uryyb. Ubj ner lbh?”
So the steps to encrypt a letter are:
1. Decide on a key from 1 to 25. Keep this key secret!
2. Find the plaintext letter’s number.
3. Add the key to the plaintext letter’s number.
4. If this number is larger than 26, subtract 26.
5. Find the letter for the number you’ve calculated. This is the ciphertext letter.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for every letter in the plaintext message.
Look at the following table to see how this is done with each letter in “Hello. How are you?” with
key 13. Each column shows the steps for turning the plaintext letter on the left to the ciphertext
letter on the right.

To decrypt, you will have to understand what negative numbers are. If you don’t know how to
add and subtract with negative numbers, there is a tutorial on it here: http://invpy.com/neg.
To decrypt, subtract the key instead of adding it. For the ciphertext letter B, the number is 1.
Subtract 1 – 13 to get -12. Like our “subtract 26” rule for encrypting, when we are decrypting and
the result is less than 0, we have an “add 26” rule. -12 + 26 is 14. So the ciphertext letter B
decrypts back to letter O.

As you can see, we don’t need an actual cipher wheel to do the Caesar cipher. If you memorize
the numbers and letters, then you don’t even need to write out the alphabet with the numbers
under them. You could just do some simple math in your head and write out secret messages.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 1, Set B

Double-Strength Encryption?
You might think that encrypting a message twice with two different keys would double the
strength of our encryption. But this turns out not to be the case with the Caesar cipher (and most
other ciphers). Let’s try double-encrypting a message to see why.

14

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

If we encrypt the word “KITTEN” with the key 3, the resulting cipher text would be
“NLWWHQ”. If we encrypt the word “NLWWHQ” with the key 4, the resulting cipher text of
that would be “RPAALU”. But this is exactly the same as if we had encrypted the word
“KITTEN” once with a key of 7. Our “double” encryption is the same as normal encryption, so it
isn’t any stronger.
The reason is that when we encrypt with the key 3, we are adding 3 to plaintext letter’s number.
Then when we encrypt with the key 4, we are adding 4 to the plaintext letter’s number. But
adding 3 and then adding 4 is the exact same thing as adding 7. Encrypting twice with keys 3 and
4 is the same as encrypting once with the key 7.
For most encryption ciphers, encrypting more than once does not provide additional
strength to the cipher. In fact, if you encrypt some plaintext with two keys that add up to 26, the
ciphertext you end up with will be the same as the original plaintext!

Programming a Computer to do Encryption
The Caesar cipher, or ciphers like it, were used to encrypt secret information for several centuries.
Here’s a cipher disk of a design invented by Albert Myer that was used in the American Civil
War in 1863.

Figure 1-13. American Civil War Union Cipher Disk at the National Cryptologic Museum.
If you had a very long message that you wanted to encrypt (say, an entire book) it would take you
days or weeks to encrypt it all by hand. This is how programming can help. A computer could do

the work for a large amount of text in less than a second! But we need to learn how to instruct
(that is, program) the computer to do the same steps we just did.
We will have to be able to speak a language the computer can understand. Fortunately, learning a
programming language isn’t nearly as hard as learning a foreign language like Japanese or
Spanish. You don’t even need to know much math besides addition, subtraction, and
multiplication. You just need to download some free software called Python, which we will cover
in the next chapter.

INSTALLING PYTHON
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 Downloading and installing Python
 Downloading the Pyperclip module
 How to start IDLE
 Formatting used in this book
 Copying and pasting text

“Privacy in an open society also requires
cryptography. If I say something, I want it
heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the
content of my speech is available to the world, I
have no privacy.”
Eric Hughes, “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto”, 1993
http://invpy.com/cypherpunk

The content of this chapter is very similar to the first chapter of Invent Your Own Computer
Games with Python. If you have already read that book or have already installed Python, you only
need to read the “Downloading pyperclip.py” section in this chapter.

Chapter 2 – Downloading and Installing Python

17

Downloading and Installing Python
Before we can begin programming, you’ll need to install software called the Python interpreter.
(You may need to ask an adult for help here.) The interpreter is a program that understands the
instructions that you’ll write in the Python language. Without the interpreter, your computer won't
understand these instructions. (We'll refer to “the Python interpreter” as “Python” from now on.)
Because we’ll be writing our programs in the Python language we need to download Python from
the official website of the Python programming language, http://www.python.org. The installation
is a little different depending on if your computer’s operating system is Windows, OS X, or a
Linux distribution such as Ubuntu. You can also find videos of people installing the Python
software online at http://invpy.com/installing.
Important Note! Be sure to install Python 3, and not Python 2. The programs in this book use
Python 3, and you’ll get errors if you try to run them with Python 2. It is so important, I am
adding a cartoon penguin telling you to install Python 3 so that you do not miss this message:

Figure 2-1. “Be sure to install Python 3, not Python 2!”, says the incongruous penguin.

Windows Instructions
There is a list of links on the left side of the web page at http://www.python.org. Click on the
Download link to go to the download page, then look for the file called Python 3.3.0 Windows
Installer (“Windows binary — does not include source”) and click on its link to download Python
for Windows. (If there is a newer version than Python 3.3.0, you can download that one.)
Double-click on the python-3.3.0.msi file that you’ve just downloaded to start the Python
installer. (If it doesn’t start, try right-clicking the file and choosing Install.) Once the installer
starts up, click the Next button and accept the choices in the installer as you go. There’s no need
to make any changes. When the installer is finished, click Finish.

18

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

OS X Instructions
The installation for OS X is similar. Instead of downloading the .msi file from the Python
website, download the .dmg Mac Installer Disk Image file instead. The link to this file will look
something like “Python 3.3.0 Mac OS X” on the “Download Python Software” web page.

Ubuntu and Linux Instructions
If your operating system is Ubuntu, you can install Python by opening a terminal window (click
on Applications ► Accessories ► Terminal) and entering sudo apt-get install
python3.3 then pressing Enter. You will need to enter the root password to install Python, so
ask the person who owns the computer to type in this password.
You also need to install the IDLE software. From the terminal, type in sudo apt-get
install idle3. You will also need the root password to install IDLE.

Downloading pyperclip.py
Almost every program in this book uses a custom module I wrote called pyperclip.py. This
module provides functions for letting your program copy and paste text to the clipboard. This
module does not come with Python, but you can download it from: http://invpy.com/pyperclip.py
This file must be in the same folder as the Python program files that you type. (A folder is also
called a directory.) Otherwise you will see this error message when you try to run your program:
ImportError: No module named pyperclip

Starting IDLE
We will be using the IDLE software to type in our programs and run them. IDLE stands for
Interactive DeveLopment Environment. While Python is the software that interprets and runs
your Python programs, the IDLE software is what you type your programs in.
If your operating system is Windows XP, you should be able to run Python by clicking the Start
button, then selecting Programs ► Python 3.3 ► IDLE (Python GUI). For Windows Vista or
Windows 7, click the Windows button in the lower left corner, type “IDLE” and select “IDLE
(Python GUI)”.
If your operating system is Max OS X, start IDLE by opening the Finder window and clicking on
Applications, then click Python 3.3, then click the IDLE icon.

Chapter 2 – Downloading and Installing Python

19

If your operating system is Ubuntu or Linux, start IDLE by clicking Applications ► Accessories
► Terminal and then type idle3. You may also be able to click on Applications at the top of
the screen, and then select Programming and then IDLE 3.

Figure 2-2. IDLE running on Windows (left), OS X (center), and Ubuntu Linux (right).
The window that appears will be mostly blank except for text that looks something like this:
Python 3.3.0 (v3.3.0:bd8afb90ebf2, Sep 29 2012, 10:57:17) [MSC v.1600 64 bit
(AMD64)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>>

The window that appears when you first run IDLE is called the interactive shell. A shell is a
program that lets you type instructions into the computer. The Python shell lets you type Python
instructions in and then sends these instructions to the Python interpreter software to run. We can
type Python instructions into the shell and, because the shell is interactive, the computer will read
our instructions and perform them immediately.

The Featured Programs
“Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python” is different from other programming books because it
focuses on the source code for complete programs. Instead of teaching you programming
concepts and leaving it up to you to figure out how to make your own programs, this book shows
you complete programs and explains how they work.
As you read through this book, type the source code from this book into IDLE yourself. But you
can also download the source code files from this book’s website. Go to the web site
http://invpy.com/hackingsource and follow the instructions to download the source code files.
In general, you should read this book from front to back. The programming concepts build on
the previous chapters. However, Python is such a readable language that after the first few
chapters you can probably piece together what the code does. If you jump ahead and feel lost, try

20

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

going back to the previous chapters. Or email your programming questions to the author at
al@inventwithpython.com.

Line Numbers and Spaces
When entering the source code yourself, do not type the line numbers that appear at the beginning
of each line. For example, if you see this in the book:
1. number = random.randint(1, 20)
2. spam = 42
3. print('Hello world!')

…then you do not need to type the “1.” on the left side, or the space that immediately follows it.
Just type it like this:
number = random.randint(1, 20)
spam = 42
print('Hello world!')

Those numbers are only used so that this book can refer to specific lines in the code. They are not
a part of the actual program. Aside from the line numbers, be sure to enter the code exactly as it
appears. This includes the letter casing. In Python, HELLO and hello and Hello could refer to
three different things.
Notice that some of the lines don’t begin at the leftmost edge of the page, but are indented by four
or eight spaces. Be sure to put in the correct number of spaces at the start of each line. (Since each
character in IDLE is the same width, you can count the number of spaces by counting the number
of characters above or below the line you’re looking at.)
For example, you can see that the second line is indented by four spaces because the four
characters (“whil”) on the line above are over the indented space. The third line is indented by
another four spaces (the four characters “if n” are above the third line’s indented space):
while spam < 10:
if number == 42:
print('Hello')

Text Wrapping in This Book
Some lines of code are too long to fit on one line on the page, and the text of the code will wrap
around to the next line. When you type these lines into the file editor, enter the code all on one
line without pressing Enter.

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 2 – Downloading and Installing Python

21

You can tell when a new line starts by looking at the line numbers on the left side of the code.
The example below has only two lines of code, even though the first line is too long to fit on the
page:
1. print('This is the first line! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx’)
2. print('This is the second line!')

Tracing the Program Online
Tracing a program means to step through the code one line at a time, in the same way that a
computer would execute it. You can visit http://invpy.com/hackingtraces to see a trace through of
each program in this book. The traces web page has notes and helpful reminders at each step of
the trace to explain what the program is doing, so it can help you better understand why these
programs work the way they do.

Checking Your Typed Code with the Online Diff Tool
Although it is very helpful to learn Python by typing out the source code for these programs, you
may accidentally make typos that cause your programs to crash. It may not be obvious where the
typo is.
You can copy and paste the text of your typed source code to the online diff tool on the book’s
website. The diff tool will show any differences between the source code in the book and the
source code you’ve typed. This is an easy way of finding any typos in your programs.
The online diff tool is at this web page: http://invpy.com/hackingdiff. A video tutorial of how to
use the diff tool is available from this book’s website at http://invpy.com/hackingvideos.

Copying and Pasting Text
Copying and pasting text is a very useful computer skill, especially for this book because many of
the texts that will be encrypted or decrypted are quite long. Instead of typing them out, you can
look at electronic versions of the text on this book’s website and copy the text from your browser
and paste it into IDLE.
To copy and paste text, you first need to drag the mouse over the text you want to copy. This will
highlight the text. Then you can either click on the Edit ► Copy menu item, or on Windows
press Ctrl-C. (That’s press and hold the Ctrl button, then press C once, then let go of the Ctrl
button.) On Macs, the keyboard shortcut is Command-C (the ⌘ button). This will copy the
highlighted text to the computer’s memory, or clipboard.

22

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

To paste the text that is on the clipboard, move the cursor to the place you want the text to be
inserted. Then either click on the Edit ► Paste menu item or press Ctrl-V or Command-V.
Pasting will have the same effect as if you typed out all the characters that were copied to the
clipboard. Copying and pasting can save you a lot of typing time, and unlike typing it will never
make a mistake in reproducing the text.
You should note that every time you copy text to the clipboard, the previous text that was on the
clipboard is forgotten.
There is a tutorial on copying and pasting at this book’s website at http://invpy.com/copypaste.

More Info Links
There is a lot that you can learn about programming and cryptography, but you don’t need to
learn all of it now. There are several times where you might like to learn these additional details
and explanations, but if I included them in this book then it would add many more pages.
Publication of this larger book would place so much combustible paper into a single space that
the book would be a fire hazard. Instead, I have included “more info” links in this book that you
can follow to this book’s website. You do not have to read this additional information to
understand anything in this book, but it will help you learn. These links begin with
http://invpy.com (which is the shortened URL for the “Invent with Python” book website.)
Even though this book is not a dangerous fire hazard, please do not set it on fire anyway.

Programming and Cryptography
Programming and cryptography are two separate skills, but learning both is useful because a
computer can do cryptography much faster than a human can. For example, here is the entire text
of William Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” encrypted with a simple substitution cipher:

If you tried to encrypt this by hand, working 12 hours a day and taking time off for weekends, it
would take you about three weeks to encrypt. And you would probably make some mistakes. It
would take another three weeks to decrypt the encrypted ciphertext.
Your computer can encrypt or decrypt the entire play perfectly in less than two seconds.
But you need to know how to program a computer to do the encryption. That’s what this book is
for. If you can program a computer, you can also hack ciphertext that other people have encrypted
and tried to keep secret. Learn to program a computer, and you can learn to be a hacker.
Let’s begin!

Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 Integers and floating point numbers
 Expressions
 Values
 Operators
 Evaluating expressions
 Storing values in variables
 Overwriting variables
Before we start writing encryption programs we should first learn some basic programming
concepts. These concepts are values, operators, expressions, and variables. If you’ve read the
Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python book (which can be downloaded for free from
http://inventwithpython.com) or already know Python, you can skip directly to chapter 5.
Let’s start by learning how to use Python’s interactive shell. You should read this book while
near your computer, so you can type in the short code examples and see for yourself what they
do.

Some Simple Math Stuff
Start by opening IDLE. You will see the interactive shell and the cursor blinking next to the >>>
(which is called the prompt). The interactive shell can work just like a calculator. Type 2 + 2
into the shell and press the Enter key on your keyboard. (On some keyboards, this is the Return
key.) As you can see in Figure 3-1, the computer should respond with the number 4.

Figure 3-1. Type 2+2 into the shell.
2 + 2 isn’t a program by itself, it’s just a single instruction (we’re just learning the basics right
now). The + sign tells the computer to add the numbers 2 and 2. To subtract numbers use the –
sign. To multiply numbers use an asterisk (*) and to divide numbers use /.
Table 3-1: The various math operators in Python.
Operator
+
*
/

Operation
addition
subtraction
multiplication
division

When used in this way, +, -, *, and / are called operators because they tell the computer to
perform an operation on the numbers surrounding them. The 2s (or any other number) are called
values.

Integers and Floating Point Values
In programming whole numbers like 4, 0, and 99 are called integers. Numbers with fractions or
decimal points (like 3.5 and 42.1 and 5.0) are floating point numbers. In Python, the
number 5 is an integer, but if we wrote it as 5.0 it would be a floating point number

Expressions
Try typing some of these math problems into the shell, pressing Enter key after each one:
2+2+2+2+2
8*6
10-5+6
2 +

2

Figure 3-2 is what the interactive shell will look like after you type in the previous instructions.

Figure 3-2. What the IDLE window looks like after entering instructions.
These math problems are called expressions. Computers can solve millions of these problems in
seconds. Expressions are made up of values (the numbers) connected by operators (the math
signs). There can be any amount of spaces in between the integers and these operators. But be
sure to always start at the very beginning of the line though, with no spaces in front.

Figure 3-3. An expression is made up of values (like 2) and operators (like +).

Order of Operations
You might remember “order of operations” from your math class. For example, multiplication
has a higher priority than addition. Python copies this for the * and + operators. If an expression
has both * and + operators, the * operator is evaluated first. Type the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> 2 + 4 * 3 + 1
15
>>>

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 3 – The Interactive Shell

29

Because the * operator is evaluated first, 2 + 4 * 3 + 1 evaluates to 2 + 12 + 1 and
then evaluates to 15. It does not evaluate to 6 * 3 + 1, then to 18 + 1, and then to 19.
However, you can always use parentheses to change which should operations should happen first.
Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> (2 + 4) * (3 + 1)
24
>>>

Evaluating Expressions
When a computer solves the expression 10 + 5 and gets the value 15, we say it has evaluated
the expression. Evaluating an expression reduces the expression to a single value, just like solving
a math problem reduces the problem to a single number: the answer.
An expression will always evaluate (that is, shorten down to) a single value.
The expressions 10 + 5 and 10 + 3 + 2 have the same value, because they both evaluate to
15. Even single values are considered expressions: The expression 15 evaluates to the value 15.
However, if you type only 5 + into the interactive shell, you will get an error message.
>>> 5 +
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This error happened because 5 + is not an expression. Expressions have values connected by
operators, but in the Python language the + operator expects to connect two values. We have only
given it one in “5 + ”. This is why the error message appeared. A syntax error means that the
computer does not understand the instruction you gave it because you typed it incorrectly. This
may not seem important, but a lot of computer programming is not just telling the computer what
to do, but also knowing exactly how to tell the computer to do it.

Errors are Okay!
It’s perfectly okay to make errors! You will not break your computer by typing in bad code that
causes errors. If you type in code that causes an error, Python simply says there was an error and
then displays the >>> prompt again. You can keep typing in new code into the interactive shell.
Until you get more experience with programming, the error messages might not make a lot of
sense to you. You can always Google the text of the error message to find web pages that talk
about that specific error. You can also go to http://invpy.com/errors to see a list of common
Python error messages and their meanings.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 3, Set A

Every Value has a Data Type
“Integer” and “floating point” are known as data types. Every value has a data type. The value
42 is a value of the integer data type. We will say 42 is an int for short. The value 7.5 is a value
of the floating point data type. We will say 7.5 is a float for short.
There are a few other data types that we will learn about (such as strings in the next chapter), but
for now just remember that any time we say “value”, that value is of a certain data type. It’s
usually easy to tell the data type just from looking at how the value is typed out. Ints are numbers
without decimal points. Floats are numbers with decimal points. So 42 is an int, but 42.0 is a
float.

Storing Values in Variables with Assignment Statements
Our programs will often want to save the values that our expressions evaluate to so we can use
them later. We can store values in variables.
Think of a variable as like a box that can hold values. You can store values inside variables with
the = sign (called the assignment operator). For example, to store the value 15 in a variable
named “spam”, enter spam = 15 into the shell:
>>> spam = 15
>>>

Figure 3-4. Variables are like boxes with names that can hold values in them.

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 3 – The Interactive Shell

31

You can think of the variable like a box with the value 15 inside of it (as shown in Figure 3-4).
The variable name “spam” is the label on the box (so we can tell one variable from another) and
the value stored in it is like a small note inside the box.
When you press Enter you won’t see anything in response, other than a blank line. Unless you see
an error message, you can assume that the instruction has been executed successfully. The next
>>> prompt will appear so that you can type in the next instruction.
This instruction with the = assignment operator (called an assignment statement) creates the
variable spam and stores the value 15 in it. Unlike expressions, statements are instructions that
do not evaluate to any value, they just perform some action. This is why there is no value
displayed on the next line in the shell.
It might be confusing to know which instructions are expressions and which are statements. Just
remember that if a Python instruction evaluates to a single value, it’s an expression. If a
Python instruction does not, then it’s a statement.
An assignment statement is written as a variable, followed by the = operator, followed by an
expression. The value that the expression evaluates to is stored inside the variable. (The value 15
by itself is an expression that evaluates to 15.)

Figure 3-5. The parts of an assignment statement.
Remember, variables store single values, not expressions. For example, if we had the statement,
spam = 10 + 5, then the expression 10 + 5 would first be evaluated to 15 and then the
value 15 would be stored in the variable spam. A variable is created the first time you store a
value in it by using an assignment statement.
>>> spam = 15
>>> spam
15
>>>

32

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

And here’s an interesting twist. If we now enter spam + 5 into the shell, we get the integer 20:
>>> spam = 15
>>> spam + 5
20
>>>

That may seem odd but it makes sense when we remember that we set the value of spam to 15.
Because we’ve set the value of the variable spam to 15, the expression spam + 5 evaluates to
the expression 15 + 5, which then evaluates to 20. A variable name in an expression evaluates
to the value stored in that variable.

Overwriting Variables
We can change the value stored in a variable by entering another assignment statement. For
example, try the following:
>>>
>>>
20
>>>
>>>
8
>>>

spam = 15
spam + 5
spam = 3
spam + 5

The first time we enter spam + 5, the expression evaluates to 20, because we stored the value
15 inside the variable spam. But when we enter spam = 3, the value 15 is overwritten (that
is, replaced) with the value 3. Now, when we enter spam + 5, the expression evaluates to 8
because the spam + 5 now evaluates to 3 + 5. The old value in spam is forgotten.
To find out what the current value is inside a variable, enter the variable name into the shell.
>>> spam = 15
>>> spam
15

This happens because a variable by itself is an expression that evaluates to the value stored in the
variable. This is just like how a value by itself is also an expression that evaluates to itself:
>>> 15
15

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 3 – The Interactive Shell

33

We can even use the value in the spam variable to assign spam a new value:
>>> spam = 15
>>> spam = spam + 5
20
>>>

The assignment statement spam = spam + 5 is like saying, “the new value of the spam
variable will be the current value of spam plus five.” Remember that the variable on the left side
of the = sign will be assigned the value that the expression on the right side evaluates to. We can
keep increasing the value in spam by 5 several times:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
30
>>>

spam
spam
spam
spam
spam

=
=
=
=

15
spam + 5
spam + 5
spam + 5

Using More Than One Variable
Your programs can have as many variables as you need. For example, let’s assign different values
to two variables named eggs and fizz:
>>> fizz = 10
>>> eggs = 15

Now the fizz variable has 10 inside it, and eggs has 15 inside it.

34

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Figure 3-6. The “fizz” and “eggs” variables have values stored in them.
Let’s try assigning a new value to the spam variable. Enter spam = fizz + eggs into the
shell, then enter spam into the shell to see the new value of spam. Type the following into the
interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
25
>>>

fizz = 10
eggs = 15
spam = fizz + eggs
spam

The value in spam is now 25 because when we add fizz and eggs we are adding the values
stored inside fizz and eggs.

Variable Names
The computer doesn’t care what you name your variables, but you should. Giving variables
names that reflect what type of data they contain makes it easier to understand what a program
does. Instead of name, we could have called this variable abrahamLincoln or monkey. The
computer will run the program the same (as long as you consistently use abrahamLincoln or
monkey).
Variable names (as well as everything else in Python) are case-sensitive. Case-sensitive means
the same variable name in a different case is considered to be an entirely separate variable. So
spam, SPAM, Spam, and sPAM are considered to be four different variables in Python. They
each can contain their own separate values.

Chapter 3 – The Interactive Shell

35

It’s a bad idea to have differently-cased variables in your program. If you stored your first name
in the variable name and your last name in the variable NAME, it would be very confusing when
you read your code weeks after you first wrote it. Did name mean first and NAME mean last, or
the other way around?
If you accidentally switch the name and NAME variables, then your program will still run (that is,
it won’t have any “syntax” errors) but it will run incorrectly. This type of flaw in your code is
called a bug. A lot of programming is not just writing code but also fixing bugs.

Camel Case
It also helps to capitalize variable names if they include more than one word. If you store a string
of what you had for breakfast in a variable, the variable name whatIHadForBreakfast is
much easier to read than whatihadforbreakfast. This is called camel case, since the
casing goes up and down like a camel’s humps. This is a convention (that is, an optional but
standard way of doing things) in Python programming. (Although even better would be
something simple, like todaysBreakfast. Capitalizing the first letter of each word after the
first word in variable names makes the program more readable.

Summary - But When Are We Going to Start Hacking?
Soon. But before we can hack ciphers, we need to learn some more basic programming concepts.
We won’t need to learn a lot before we start writing encryption programs, but there’s one more
chapter on programming we need to cover.
In this chapter you learned the basics about writing Python instructions in the interactive shell.
Python needs you to tell it exactly what to do in a strict way, because computers don’t have
common sense and only understand very simple instructions. You have learned that Python can
evaluate expressions (that is, reduce the expression to a single value), and that expressions are
values (such as 2 or 5) combined with operators (such as + or -). You have also learned that you
can store values inside of variables so that your program can remember them to use them later on.
The interactive shell is a very useful tool for learning what Python instructions do because it lets
you type them in one at a time and see the results. In the next chapter, we will be creating
programs of many instructions that are executed in sequence rather than one at a time. We will go
over some more basic concepts, and you will write your first program!

STRINGS AND WRITING
PROGRAMS
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 Strings
 String concatenation and replication
 Using IDLE to write source code
 Saving and running programs in IDLE
 The print() function
 The input() function
 Comments
That's enough of integers and math for now. Python is more than just a calculator. In this chapter,
we will learn how to store text in variables, combine text together, and display text on the screen.
We will also make our first program, which greets the user with the text, “Hello World!” and lets
the user type in a name.

Strings
In Python, we work with little chunks of text called string values (or simply strings). All of our
cipher and hacking programs deal with string values to turn plaintext like 'One if by land,
two if by space.' into ciphertext like 'Tqe kg im npqv, jst kg im oapxe.'.
The plaintext and ciphertext are represented in our program as string values, and there’s a lot of
ways that Python code can manipulate these values.

Chapter 4 – Strings and Writing Programs

37

We can store string values inside variables just like integer and floating point values. When we
type strings, we put them in between two single quotes (') to show where the string starts and
ends. Type this in to the interactive shell:
>>> spam = 'hello'
>>>

The single quotes are not part of the string value. Python knows that 'hello' is a string and
spam is a variable because strings are surrounded by quotes and variable names are not.
If you type spam into the shell, you should see the contents of the spam variable (the 'hello'
string.) This is because Python will evaluate a variable to the value stored inside it: in this case,
the string 'hello'.
>>> spam = 'hello'
>>> spam
'hello'
>>>

Strings can have almost any keyboard character in them. (We’ll talk about special “escape
characters” later.) These are all examples of strings:
>>> 'hello'
'hello'
>>> 'Hi there!'
'Hi there!’
>>> 'KITTENS'
'KITTENS'
>>> ''
''
>>> '7 apples, 14 oranges, 3 lemons'
'7 apples, 14 oranges, 3 lemons'
>>> 'Anything not pertaining to elephants is irrelephant.'
'Anything not pertaining to elephants is irrelephant.'
>>> 'O*&#wY%*&OcfsdYO*&gfC%YO*&%3yc8r2'
'O*&#wY%*&OcfsdYO*&gfC%YO*&%3yc8r2'

Notice that the '' string has zero characters in it; there is nothing in between the single quotes.
This is known as a blank string or empty string.

38

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

String Concatenation with the + Operator
You can add together two string values into one new string value by using the + operator. Doing
this is called string concatenation. Try entering 'Hello' + 'World! ' into the shell:
>>> 'Hello' + 'World!'
'HelloWorld!'
>>>

To put a space between “Hello” and “World!”, put a space at the end of the 'Hello' string and
before the single quote, like this:
>>> 'Hello ' + 'World!'
'Hello World!'
>>>

Remember, Python will concatenate exactly the strings you tell it to concatenate. If you want a
space in the resulting string, there must be a space in one of the two original strings.
The + operator can concatenate two string values into a new string value ('Hello ' +
'World!' to 'Hello World!'), just like it could add two integer values into a new integer
value (2 + 2 to 4). Python knows what the + operator should do because of the data types of the
values. Every value is of a data type. The data type of the value 'Hello' is a string. The data
type of the value 5 is an integer. The data type of the data that tells us (and the computer) what
kind of data the value is.
The + operator can be used in an expression with two strings or two integers. If you try to use the
+ operator with a string value and an integer value, you will get an error. Type this code into the
interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello' + 42
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
>>> 'Hello' + '42'
'Hello42'
>>>

Chapter 4 – Strings and Writing Programs

39

String Replication with the * Operator
You can also use the * operator on a string and an integer to do string replication. This will
replicate (that is, repeat) a string by however many times the integer value is. Type the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello' * 3
'HelloHelloHello'
>>> spam = 'Abcdef'
>>> spam = spam * 3
>>> spam
'AbcdefAbcdefAbcdef'
>>> spam = spam * 2
>>> spam
'AbcdefAbcdefAbcdefAbcdefAbcdefAbcdef'
>>>

The * operator can work with two integer values (it will multiply them). It can also work with a
string value and an integer value (it will replicate the string). But it cannot work with two string
values, which would cause an error:
>>> 'Hello' * 'world!'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
>>>

What string concatenation and string replication show is that operators in Python can do different
things based on the data types of the values they operate on. The + operator can do addition or
string concatenation. The * operator can do multiplication or string replication.

Printing Values with the print() Function
There is another type of Python instruction called a print() function call. Type the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> print('Hello!')
Hello!
>>> print(42)
42
>>>

40

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

A function (like print() in the above example) has code in that performs a task, such as
printing values on the screen. There are many different functions that come with Python. To call
a function means to execute the code that is inside the function.
The instructions in the above example pass a value to the print() function in between the
parentheses, and the print() function will print the value to the screen. The values that are
passed when a function is called are called arguments. (Arguments are the same as values
though. We just call values this when they are passed to function calls.) When we begin to write
programs, the way we make text appear on the screen is with the print() function.
You can pass an expression to the print() function instead of a single value. This is because
the value that is actually passed to the print() function is the evaluated value of that
expression. Try this string concatenation expression in the interactive shell:
>>> spam = 'Al'
>>> print('Hello, ' + spam)
Hello, Al
>>>

The 'Hello, ' + spam expression evaluates to 'Hello, ' + spam, which then
evaluates to the string value 'Hello, Al'. This string value is what is passed to the print()
function call.

Escape Characters
Sometimes we might want to use a character that cannot easily be typed into a string value. For
example, we might want to put a single quote character as part of a string. But we would get an
error message because Python thinks that single quote is the quote ending the string value, and
the text after it is bad Python code instead of just the rest of the string. Type the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> print('Al's cat is named Zophie.')
File "<stdin>", line 1
print('Al's cat is named Zophie.')
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>

To use a single quote in a string, we need to use escape characters. An escape character is a
backslash character followed by another character. For example, \t, \n or \'. The slash tells

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 4 – Strings and Writing Programs

41

Python that the character after the slash has a special meaning. Type the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> print('Al\'s cat is named Zophie.')
Al's cat is named Zophie.
>>>

An escape character helps us print out letters that are hard to type into the source code. Table 4-1
shows some escape characters in Python:
Table 4-1. Escape Characters
Escape Character
\\
\'
\"
\n
\t

What Is Actually Printed
Backslash (\)
Single quote (')
Double quote (")
Newline
Tab

The backslash always precedes an escape character, even if you just want a backslash in your
string. This line of code would not work:
>>> print('He flew away in a green\teal helicopter.')
He flew away in a green
eal helicopter.

This is because the “t” in “teal” was seen as an escape character since it came after a backslash.
The escape character \t simulates pushing the Tab key on your keyboard. Escape characters are
there so that strings can have characters that cannot be typed in.
Instead, try this code:
>>> print('He flew away in a green\\teal helicopter.')
He flew away in a green\teal helicopter.

Quotes and Double Quotes
Strings don’t always have to be in between two single quotes in Python. You can use double
quotes instead. These two lines print the same thing:
>>> print('Hello world')
Hello world
>>> print("Hello world")

42

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Hello world

But you cannot mix single and double quotes. This line will give you an error:
>>> print('Hello world")
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning single-quoted string
>>>

I like to use single quotes so I don’t have to hold down the shift key on the keyboard to type
them. It’s easier to type, and the computer doesn’t care either way.
But remember, just like you have to use the escape character \' to have a single quote in a string
surrounded by single quotes, you need the escape character \" to have a double quote in a string
surrounded by double quotes. For example, look at these two lines:
>>> print('I asked to borrow Alice\'s car for a week. She said, "Sure."')
I asked to borrow Alice's car for a week. She said, "Sure."
>>> print("She said, \"I can't believe you let him borrow your car.\"")
She said, "I can't believe you let him borrow your car."

You do not need to escape double quotes in single-quote strings, and you do not need to escape
single quotes in the double-quote strings. The Python interpreter is smart enough to know that if a
string starts with one kind of quote, the other kind of quote doesn’t mean the string is ending.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 4, Set A

Indexing
Your encryption programs will often need to get a single character from a string. Indexing is the
adding of square brackets [ and ] to the end of a string value (or a variable containing a string)
with a number between them. This number is called the index, and tells Python which position in
the string has the character you want. The index of the first character in a string is 0. The index 1
is for the second character, the index 2 is for the third character, and so on.
Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = 'Hello'
>>> spam[0]
'H'
>>> spam[1]
'e'

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 4 – Strings and Writing Programs

43

>>> spam[2]
'l'

Notice that the expression spam[0] evaluates to the string value 'H', since H is the first
character in the string 'Hello'. Remember that indexes start at 0, not 1. This is why the H’s
index is 0, not 1.

Figure 4-1. The string 'Hello' and its indexes.
Indexing can be used with a variable containing a string value or a string value by itself such as
'Zophie'. Type this into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Zophie'[2]
'p'

The expression 'Zophie'[2] evaluates to the string value 'p'. This 'p' string is just like
any other string value, and can be stored in a variable. Type the following into the interactive
shell:
>>> eggs = 'Zopie'[2]
>>> eggs
'p'
>>>

If you enter an index that is too large for the string, Python will display an “index out of range”
error message. There are only 5 characters in the string 'Hello'. If we try to use the index 10,
then Python will display an error saying that our index is “out of range”:
>>> 'Hello'[10]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range
>>>

44

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Negative Indexes
Negative indexes start at the end of a string and go backwards. The negative index -1 is the index
of the last character in a string. The index -2 is the index of the second to last character, and so
on.
Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
'o'
>>>
'l'
>>>
'l'
>>>
'e'
>>>
'H'
>>>
'H'
>>>

'Hello'[-1]
'Hello'[-2]
'Hello'[-3]
'Hello'[-4]
'Hello'[-5]
'Hello'[0]

Notice that -5 and 0 are the indexes for the same character. Most of the time your code will use
positive indexes, but sometimes it will be easier to use negative indexes.

Slicing
If you want to get more than one character from a string, you can use slicing instead of indexing.
A slice also uses the [ and ] square brackets but has two integer indexes instead of one. The two
indexes are separate by a : colon. Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Howdy'[0:3]
'How'
>>>

The string that the slice evaluates to begins at the first index and goes up to, but not including,
the second index. The 0 index of the string value 'Howdy' is the H and the 3 index is the d.
Since a slice goes up to but not including the second index, the slice 'Howdy'[0:3] evaluates
to the string value 'How'.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello world!'[0:5]

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 4 – Strings and Writing Programs

45

'Hello'
>>> 'Hello world!'[6:12]
'world!'
>>> 'Hello world!'[-6:-1]
'world'
>>> 'Hello world!'[6:12][2]
'r'
>>>

Notice that the expression 'Hello world!'[6:12][2] first evaluates to 'world!'[2]
which is an indexing that further evaluates to 'r'.
Unlike indexes, slicing will never give you an error if you give it too large of an index for the
string. It will just return the widest matching slice it can:
>>> 'Hello'[0:999]
'Hello'
>>> 'Hello'[2:999]
'llo'
>>> 'Hello'[1000:2000]
''
>>>

The expression 'Hello'[1000:2000] returns a blank string because the index 1000 is after
the end of the string, so there are no possible characters this slice could include.

Blank Slice Indexes
If you leave out the first index of a slice, Python will automatically think you want to specify
index 0 for the first index. The expressions 'Howdy'[0:3] and 'Howdy'[:3] evaluate the
same string:
>>> 'Howdy'[:3]
'How'
>>> 'Howdy'[0:3]
'How'
>>>

If you leave out the second index, Python will automatically think you want to specify the rest of
the string:
>>> 'Howdy'[2:]
'wdy'

Slicing is a simple way to get a “substring” from a larger string. (But really, a “substring” is still
just a string value like any other string.) Try typing the following into the shell:

>>> myName = 'Zophie the Fat Cat'
>>> myName[-7:]
'Fat Cat'
>>> myName[:10]
'Zophie the'
>>> myName[7:]
'the Fat Cat'

Writing Programs in IDLE’s File Editor
Until now we have been typing instructions one at a time into the interactive shell. When we
write programs though, we type in several instructions and have them run without waiting on us
for the next one. Let’s write our first program!
The name of the software program that provides the interactive shell is called IDLE, the
Interactive DeveLopement Environment. IDLE also has another part besides the interactive shell
called the file editor.
At the top of the Python shell window, click on the File ► New Window. A new blank window
will appear for us to type our program in. This window is the file editor. The bottom right of the
file editor window will show you line and column that the cursor currently is in the file.

Figure 4-2. The file editor window. The cursor is at line 1, column 0.
You can always tell the difference between the file editor window and the interactive shell
window because the interactive shell will always have the >>> prompt in it.

Hello World!
A tradition for programmers learning a new language is to make their first program display the
text “Hello world!” on the screen. We’ll create our own Hello World program now.
Enter the following text into the new file editor window. We call this text the program’s source

code because it contains the instructions that Python will follow to determine exactly how the
program should behave.

Source Code of Hello World
This code can be downloaded from http://invpy.com/hello.py. If you get errors after typing this
code in, compare it to the book’s code with the online diff tool at http://invpy.com/hackingdiff (or
email me at al@inventwithpython.com if you are still stuck.)

# This program says hello and asks for my name.
print('Hello world!')
print('What is your name?')
myName = input()
print('It is good to meet you, ' + myName)

The IDLE program will give different types of instructions different colors. After you are done
typing this code in, the window should look like this:

Figure 4-3. The file editor window will look like this after you type in the code.

Saving Your Program
Once you’ve entered your source code, save it so that you won’t have to retype it each time we
start IDLE. To do so, from the menu at the top of the File Editor window, choose File ► Save
As. The Save As window should open. Enter hello.py in the File Name field, then click Save.
(See Figure 4-4.)
You should save your programs every once in a while as you type them. That way, if the
computer crashes or you accidentally exit from IDLE you won’t lose everything you’ve typed. As
a shortcut, you can press Ctrl-S on Windows and Linux or ⌘-S on OS X to save your file.

A video tutorial of how to use the file editor is available from this book's website at
http://invpy.com/hackingvideos.

Running Your Program
Now it’s time to run our program. Click on Run ► Run Module or just press the F5 key on your
keyboard. Your program should run in the shell window that appeared when you first started
IDLE. Remember, you have to press F5 from the file editor’s window, not the interactive shell’s
window.
When your program asks for your name, go ahead and enter it as shown in Figure 4-5:

Figure 4-5. What the interactive shell looks like when running the “Hello World” program.
Now when you push Enter, the program should greet you (the user, that is, the one using the
program) by name. Congratulations! You’ve written your first program. You are now a beginning
computer programmer. (You can run this program again if you like by pressing F5 again.)
If you get an error that looks like this:
Hello world!
What is your name?
Albert
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/Python27/hello.py", line 4, in <module>
myName = input()
File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'Albert' is not defined

50

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

...this means you are running the program with Python 2, instead of Python 3. This makes the
penguin in the first chapter sad. (The error is caused by the input() function call, which does
different things in Python 2 and 3.) Please install Python 3 from http://python.org/getit before
continuing.

Opening The Programs You’ve Saved
Close the file editor by clicking on the X in the top corner. To reload a saved program, choose
File ► Open from the menu. Do that now, and in the window that appears choose hello.py and
press the Open button. Your saved hello.py program should open in the File Editor window.

How the “Hello World” Program Works
Each line that we entered is an instruction that tells Python exactly what to do. A computer
program is a lot like a recipe. Do the first step first, then the second, and so on until you reach the
end. Each instruction is followed in sequence, beginning from the very top of the program and
working down the list of instructions. After the program executes the first line of instructions, it
moves on and executes the second line, then the third, and so on.
We call the program’s following of instructions step-by-step the program execution, or just the

execution for short. The execution starts at the first line of code and then moves downward. The
execution can skip around instead of just going from top to bottom, and we’ll find out how to do
this in the next chapter.
Let’s look at our program one line at a time to see what it’s doing, beginning with line number 1.

Comments
hello.py

1. # This program says hello and asks for my name.

This line is called a comment. Comments are not for the computer, but for you, the programmer.
The computer ignores them. They’re used to remind you of what the program does or to tell
others who might look at your code what it is that your code is trying to do. Any text following a
# sign (called the pound sign) is a comment. (To make it easier to read the source code, this
book prints out comments in a light gray-colored text.)
Programmers usually put a comment at the top of their code to give the program a title. The IDLE
program displays comments in red text to help them stand out.

Functions
A function is kind of like a mini-program inside your program. It contains lines of code that are
executed from top to bottom. Python provides some built-in functions that we can use (you’ve
already used the print() function). The great thing about functions is that we only need to
know what the function does, but not how it does it. (You need to know that the print()
function displays text on the screen, but you don’t need to know how it does this.)
A function call is a piece of code that tells our program to run the code inside a function. For
example, your program can call the print() function whenever you want to display a string on
the screen. The print() function takes the value you type in between the parentheses as input
and displays the text on the screen. Because we want to display Hello world! on the screen,
we type the print function name, followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by the 'Hello
world!' string and a closing parenthesis.

The print() function
hello.py

2. print('Hello world!')
3. print('What is your name?')

This line is a call to the print() function (with the string to be printed going inside the
parentheses). We add parentheses to the end of function names to make it clear that we’re
referring to a function named print(), not a variable named print. The parentheses at the
end of the function let us know we are talking about a function, much like the quotes around the
number '42' tell us that we are talking about the string '42' and not the integer 42.
Line 3 is another print() function call. This time, the program displays “What is your name?”

The input() function
hello.py

4. myName = input()

Line 4 has an assignment statement with a variable (myName) and a function call (input()).
When input() is called, the program waits for the user to type in some text and press Enter.
The text string that the user types in (their name) becomes the string value that is stored in
myName.
Like expressions, function calls evaluate to a single value. The value that the function call
evaluates to is called the return value. (In fact, we can also use the word “returns” to mean the

52

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

same thing for function calls as “evaluates”.) In this case, the return value of the input()
function is the string that the user typed in-their name. If the user typed in Albert, the input()
function call evaluates (that is, returns) to the string 'Albert'.
The function named input() does not need any arguments (unlike the print() function),
which is why there is nothing in between the parentheses.
hello.py

5. print('It is good to meet you, ' + myName)

For line 5’s print() call, we use the plus operator (+) to concatenate the string 'It is
good to meet you, ' and the string stored in the myName variable, which is the name that
our user input into the program. This is how we get the program to greet us by name.

Ending the Program
Once the program executes the last line, it stops. At this point it has terminated or exited and
all of the variables are forgotten by the computer, including the string we stored in myName. If
you try running the program again and typing a different name it will print that name.
Hello world!
What is your name?
Alan
It is good to meet you, Alan

Remember, the computer only does exactly what you program it to do. In this program it is
programmed to ask you for your name, let you type in a string, and then say hello and display the
string you typed.
But computers are dumb. The program doesn’t care if you type in your name, someone else’s
name, or just something silly. You can type in anything you want and the computer will treat it
the same way:
Hello world!
What is your name?
poop
It is good to meet you, poop

Chapter 4 – Strings and Writing Programs

Summary
Writing programs is just about knowing how to speak the computer’s language. While you
learned a little bit of this in the last chapter, in this chapter you’ve put together several Python
instructions to make a complete program that asks for the user’s name and then greets them.
All of our programs later in this book will be more complex and sophisticated, but don’t worry.
The programs will all be explained line by line. And you can always enter instructions into the
interactive shell to see what they do before they are all put into a complete program.
Now let’s start with our first encryption program: the reverse cipher.

THE REVERSE CIPHER
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 The len() function
 while loops
 The Boolean data type
 Comparison operators
 Conditions
 Blocks

“Every man is surrounded by a neighborhood of
voluntary spies.”
Jane Austen

The Reverse Cipher
The reverse cipher encrypts a message by printing it in reverse order. So “Hello world!” encrypts
to “!dlrow olleH”. To decrypt, you simply reverse the reversed message to get the original
message. The encryption and decryption steps are the same.
The reverse cipher is a very weak cipher. Just by looking at its ciphertext you can figure out it is
just in reverse order. .syas ti tahw tuo erugif llits ylbaborp nac uoy ,detpyrcne si siht hguoht neve

But the code for the reverse cipher program is easy to explain, so we’ll use it as our first
encryption program.

Source Code of the Reverse Cipher Program
In IDLE, click on File ► New Window to create a new file editor window. Type in the following
code, save it as reverseCipher.py, and press F5 to run it: (Remember, don’t type in the line
numbers at the beginning of each line.)

message = 'Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.'
translated = ''
i = len(message) - 1
while i >= 0:
translated = translated + message[i]
i = i - 1
print(translated)

Sample Run of the Reverse Cipher Program
When you run this program the output will look like this:
.daed era meht fo owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT

To decrypt this message, copy the “.daed era meht fo owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT” text to the
clipboard (see http://invpy.com/copypaste for instructions on how to copy and paste text) and
paste it as the string value stored in message on line 4. Be sure to have the single quotes at the
beginning and end of the string. The new line 4 will look like this (with the change in bold):
reverseCipher.py

4. message = '.daed era meht fo owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT'

Now when you run the reverseCipher.py program, the output will decrypt to the original
message:
Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.

Checking Your Source Code with the Online Diff Tool
Even though you could copy and paste or download this code from this book’s website, it is very
helpful to type in this program yourself. This will give you a better idea of what code is in this
program. However, you might make some mistakes while typing it in yourself.
To compare the code you typed to the code that is in this book, you can use the book’s website’s
online diff tool. Copy the text of your code and open http://invpy.com/hackingdiff in your web
browser. Paste your code into the text field on this web page, and then click the Compare button.
The diff tool will show any differences between your code and the code in this book. This is an
easy way to find typos that are causing errors.

the original source. They’ll also know this program is open source software and free to distribute
to others.
reverseCipher.py

4. message = 'Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.'

Line 4 stores the string we want to encrypt in a variable named message. Whenever we want to
encrypt or decrypt a new string we will just type the string directly into the code on line 4. (The
programs in this book don’t call input(), instead the user will type in the message into the
source code. You can just change the source directly before running the program again to encrypt
different strings.)
reverseCipher.py

5. translated = ''

The translated variable is where our program will store the reversed string. At the start of the
program, it will contain the blank string. (Remember that the blank string is two single quote
characters, not one double quote character.)

The len() Function
reverseCipher.py

7. i = len(message) - 1

Line 6 is just a blank line, and Python will simply skip it. The next line of code is on line 7. This
code is just an assignment statement that stores a value in a variable named i. The expression that
is evaluated and stored in the variable is len(message) - 1.
The first part of this expression is len(message). This is a function call to the len()
function. The len() function accepts a string value argument (just like the print() function
does) and returns an integer value of how many characters are in the string (that is, the length of
the string). In this case, we pass the message variable to len(), so len(message) will tell
us how many characters are in the string value stored in message.
Let’s experiment in the interactive shell with the len() function. Type the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> len('Hello')
5

58

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

>>>
0
>>>
>>>
2
>>>
12
>>>

len('')
spam = 'Al'
len(spam)
len('Hello' + ' ' + 'world!')

From the return value of len(), we know the string 'Hello' has five characters in it and the
blank string has zero characters in it. If we store the string 'Al' in a variable and then pass the
variable to len(), the function will return 2. If we pass the expression 'Hello' + ' ' +
'world!' to the len() function, it returns 12. This is because 'Hello' + ' ' +
'world!' will evaluate to the string value 'Hello world!', which has twelve characters in
it. (The space and the exclamation point count as characters.)
Line 7 finds the number of characters in message, subtracts one, and then stores this number in
the i variable. This will be the index of the last character in the message string.

Introducing the while Loop
reverseCipher.py

8. while i >= 0:

This is a new type of Python instruction called a while loop or while statement. A while
loop is made up of four parts:
1. The while keyword.
2. An expression (also called a condition) that evaluates to the Boolean values True or
False. (Booleans are explained next in this chapter.)
3. A : colon.
4. A block (explained later) of indented code that comes after it, which is what lines 9 and
10 are. (Blocks are explained later in this chapter.)

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 5 – The Reverse Cipher

59

Figure 5-2. The parts of a while loop statement.
To understand while loops, we will first need to learn about Booleans, comparison operators,
and blocks.

The Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type has only two values: True or False. These values are case-sensitive
(you always need to capitalize the T and F, and leave the rest in lowercase). They are not string
values. You do not put a ' quote character around True or False. We will use Boolean values
(also called bools) with comparison operators to form conditions. (Explained later after
Comparison Operators.)
Like a value of any other data type, bools can be stored in variables. Type this into the interactive
shell:
>>> spam = True
>>> spam
True
>>> spam = False
>>> spam
False
>>>

Comparison Operators
In line 8 of our program, look at the expression after the while keyword:
reverseCipher.py

8. while i >= 0:

The expression that follows the while keyword (the i >= 0 part) contains two values (the
value in the variable i, and the integer value 0) connected by an operator (the >= sign, called the
“greater than or equal” operator). The >= operator is called a comparison operator.
The comparison operator is used to compare two values and evaluate to a True or False
Boolean value. Table 5-1 lists the comparison operators.

Operator Sign
<
>
<=
>=
==
!=

Operator Name
Less than

Less than or equal to
Greater than or equal to
Equal to

Enter the following expressions in the interactive shell to see the Boolean value they evaluate to:
>>> 0 < 6
True
>>> 6 < 0
False
>>> 50 < 10.5
False
>>> 10.5 < 11.3
True
>>> 10 < 10
False

The expression 0 < 6 returns the Boolean value True because the number 0 is less than the
number 6. But because 6 is not less than 0, the expression 6 < 0 evaluates to False. 50 is not
less than 10.5, so 50 < 10.5 is False. 10.5 is less than 11.3, so 10 < 11.3 evaluates
to True.
Look again at 10 < 10. It is False because the number 10 is not smaller than the number 10.
They are exactly the same size. If Alice was the same height as Bob, you wouldn’t say that Alice
is shorter than Bob. That statement would be false.
Try typing in some expressions using the other comparison operators:
>>> 10
True
>>> 10
True
>>> 10
False
>>> 20
True

<= 20
<= 10
>= 20
>= 20

>>>

Remember that for the “less than or equal to” and “greater than or equal to” operators, the < or >
sign always comes before the = sign.
Type in some expressions that use the == (equal to) and != (not equal to) operators into the shell
to see how they work:
>>> 10 == 10
True
>>> 10 == 11
False
>>> 11 == 10
False
>>> 10 != 10
False
>>> 10 != 11
True
>>> 'Hello' ==
True
>>> 'Hello' ==
False
>>> 'Hello' ==
False
>>> 'Good bye'
True

'Hello'
'Good bye'
'HELLO'
!= 'Hello'

Notice the difference between the assignment operator (=) and the “equal to” comparison
operator (==). The equal (=) sign is used to assign a value to a variable, and the equal to (==)
sign is used in expressions to see whether two values are the same. If you’re asking Python if two
things are equal, use ==. If you are telling Python to set a variable to a value, use =.
String and integer values will always be not-equal to each other. For example, try entering the
following into the interactive shell:
>>> 42 == 'Hello'
False
>>> 42 == '42'
False
>>> 10 == 10.0
True

62

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Just remember that every expression with comparison operators always evaluates to the value
True or the value False.

Conditions
A condition is another name for an expression when it is used in a while or if statement. (if
statements aren’t used in the reverse cipher program, but will be covered in the next chapter.)
Conditions usually have comparison operators, but conditions are still just expressions.

Blocks
A block is one or more lines of code grouped together with the same minimum amount of
indentation (that is, the number of spaces in front of the line). You can tell where a block begins
and ends by looking at the line’s indentation.
A block begins when a line is indented by four spaces. Any following line that is also indented by
at least four spaces is part of the block. When a line is indented with another four spaces (for a
total of eight spaces in front of the line), a new block begins inside the block. A block ends when
there is a line of code with the same indentation before the block started.
Let’s look at some imaginary code (it doesn’t matter what the code is, we are only paying
attention to the indentation of each line). We will replace the indenting spaces with black squares
to make them easier to count:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

codecodecodecodecodecodecode # zero spaces of indentation
▪▪▪▪codecodecodecodecodecodecodecodecode # four spaces of indentation

▪▪▪▪codecodecodecodecode # four spaces of indentation
▪▪▪▪codecodecodecodecodecode # four spaces of indentation
codecodecodecodecodecodecodecodecodecodecode # zero spaces of indentation

You can see that line 1 has no indentation, that is, there are zero spaces in front of the line of
code. But line 2 has four spaces of indentation. Because this is a larger amount of indentation
than the previous line, we know a new block has begun. Line 3 also has four spaces of
indentation, so we know the block continues on line 3.
Line 4 has even more indentation (8 spaces), so a new block has begun. This block is inside the
other blocks. In Python, you can have blocks-within-blocks.

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 5 – The Reverse Cipher

63

On line 5, the amount of indentation has decreased to 4, so we know that the block on the
previous line has ended. Line 4 is the only line in that block. Since line 5 has the same amount of
indentation as the block from line 3, we know that the block has continue on to line 5.
Line 6 is a blank line, so we just skip it.
Line 7 has four spaces on indentation, so we know that the block that started on line 2 has
continued to line 7.
Line 8 has zero spaces of indentation, which is less indentation than the previous line. This
decrease in indentation tells us that the previous block has ended.
There are two blocks in the above make-believe code. The first block goes from line 2 to line 7.
The second block is just made up of line 4 (and is inside the other block).
(As a side note, it doesn’t always have to be four spaces. The blocks can use any number of
spaces, but the convention is to use four spaces.)

The while Loop Statement
reverseCipher.py

8. while i >= 0:
9.
translated = translated + message[i]
10.
i = i - 1
11.
12. print(translated)

Let’s look at the while statement on line 8 again. What a while statement tells Python to do is
first check to see what the condition (which on line 8 is i >= 0) evaluates to. If the condition
evaluates to True, then the program execution enters the block following the while statement.
From looking at the indentation, this block is made up of lines 9 and 10.
If the while statement’s condition evaluates to False, then the program execution will skip the
code inside the following block and jump down to the first line after the block (which is line 12).
If the condition was True, the program execution starts at the top of the block and executes each
line in turn going down. When it reaches the bottom of the block, the program execution jumps
back to the while statement on line 8 and checks the condition again. If it is still True, the
execution jumps into the block again. If it is False, the program execution will skip past it.
You can think of the while statement while i >= 0: as meaning, “while the variable i is
greater than or equal to zero, keep executing the code in the following block”.

64

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

“Growing” a String
Remember on line 7 that the i variable is first set to the length of the message minus one, and
the while loop on line 8 will keep executing the lines inside the following block until the
condition i >= 0 is False.
reverseCipher.py

7. i = len(message) - 1
8. while i >= 0:
9.
translated = translated + message[i]
10.
i = i – 1
11.
12. print(translated)

There are two lines inside the while statement’s block, line 9 and line 10.
Line 9 is an assignment statement that stores a value in the translated variable. The value
that is stored is the current value of translated concatenated with the character at the index i
in message. In this way, the string value stored in translated “grows” until it becomes the
fully encrypted string.
Line 10 is an assignment statement also. It takes the current integer value in i and subtracts one
from it (this is called decrementing the variable), and then stores this value as the new value of
i.
The next line is line 12, but since this line has less indentation, Python knows that the while
statement’s block has ended. So rather than go on to line 12, the program execution jumps back to
line 8 where the while loop’s condition is checked again. If the condition is True, then the
lines inside the block (lines 9 and 10) are executed again. This keeps happening until the
condition is False (that is, when i is less than 0), in which case the program execution goes to
the first line after the block (line 12).
Let’s think about the behavior of this loop. The variable i starts off with the value of the last
index of message and the translated variable starts off as the blank string. Then inside the
loop, the value of message[i] (which is the last character in the message string, since i will
have the value of the last index) is added to the end of the translated string.
Then the value in i is decremented (that is, reduced) by 1. This means that message[i] will
be the second to last character. So while i as an index keeps moving from the back of the string
in message to the front, the string message[i] is added to the end of translated. This is

Chapter 5 – The Reverse Cipher

65

what causes translated to hold the reverse of the string in the message. When i is finally
set to -1, then the while loop’s condition will be False and the execution jumps to line 12.
reverseCipher.py

12. print(translated)

At the end of our program on line 12, we print out the contents of the translated variable
(that is, the string '.daed era meht fo owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT') to
the screen. This will show the user what the reversed string looks like.
If you are still having trouble understanding how the code in the while loop reverses the string,
try adding this new line inside the while loop:
reverseCipher.py

8. while i >= 0:
9.
translated = translated + message[i]
10.
print(i, message[i], translated)
11.
i = i - 1
12.
13. print(translated)

This will print out the three expressions i, message[i], and translated each time the
execution goes through the loop (that is, on each iteration of the loop). The commas tell the
print() function that we are printing three separate things, so the function will add a space in
between them. Now when you run the program, you can see how the translated variable
“grows”. The output will look like this:

.daed era meht fo owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT

The first line, which shows “48 . .”, is showing what the expressions i, message[i], and
translated evaluate to after the string message[i] has been added to the end of
translated but before i is decremented. You can see that the first time the program execution
goes through the loop, i is set to 48, and so message[i] (that is, message[48]) is the string
'.'. The translated variable started as a blank string, but when message[i] was added to
the end of it on line 9, it became the string value '.'.
On the next iteration of the loop, the print() call displays “47 . .d”. You can see that i has
been decremented from 48 to 47, and so now message[i] is message[47], which is the
'd' string. (That’s the second “d” in “dead”.) This 'd' gets added to the end of translated
so that translated is now set to '.d'.
Now you can see how the translated variable’s string is slowly “grown” from a blank string
to the reverse of the string stored in message.

Tracing Through the Program, Step by Step
The previous explanations have gone through what each line does, but let’s go step by step
through the program the same way the Python interpreter does. The interpreter starts at the very
top, executes the first line, then moves down a line to execute the next instruction. The blank lines
and comments are skipped. The while loop will cause the program execution will loop back to
the start of the loop after it finishes.
Here is a brief explanation of each line of code in the same order that the Python interpreter
executes it. Follow along with to see how the execution moves down the lines of the program, but
sometimes jumps back to a previous line.

The string value 'Three can keep a secret, if two of

Line 5 The blank string '' is stored in the translated variable.
Line 7 len(message) - 1 evaluates to 48. The integer 48 is stored in the i
variable.
Line 8 The while loop’s condition i >= 0 evaluates to True. Since the
condition is True, the program execution moves inside the following
block.
Line 9 translated + message[i] to '.'. The string value '.' is stored
in the translated variable.
Line 10 i - 1 evaluates to 47. The integer 47 is stored in the i variable.
Line 8 When the program execution reaches the end of the block, the execution
moves back to the while statement and rechecks the condition. i >= 0

evaluates to True, the program execution moves inside the block again.
translated + message[i] evaluates '.d'. The string value '.d'
is stored in the translated variable.
Line 10 i - 1 evaluates to 46. The integer 46 is stored in the i variable.
Line 8 The while statement rechecks the condition. Since i >= 0 evaluates to
True, the program execution will move inside the block again.
...The lines of the code continue to loop. We fast-forward to when i is set to
0 and translated is set to ' .daed era meht fo owt fi
,terces a peek nac eerh'...
Line 8 The while loop’s condition is checked, and 0 >= 0 evaluates to True.
Line 9 translated + message[i] evaluates to '.daed era meht fo
owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT'. This string is stored in the
translated variable.
Line 10 i - 1 evaluates to 0 - 1, which evaluates to -1. -1 is stored in the i
variable.
Line 8 The while loop’s condition is i >= 0, which evaluates to -1 >= 0,
which evaluates to False. Because the condition is now False, the
program execution skips the following block of code and goes to line 12.
Line 12 translated evaluates to the string value '.daed era meht fo
owt fi ,terces a peek nac eerhT'. The print() function is
called and this string is passed, making it appear on the screen.
There are no more lines after line 12, so the program terminates.
Line 9

Using input() In Our Programs
The programs in this book are all designed so that the strings that are being encrypted or
decrypted are typed directly into the source code. You could also modify the assignment
statements so that they call the input() function. You can pass a string to the input()
function to appear as a prompt for the user to type in the string to encrypt. For example, if you
change line 4 in reverseCipher.py to this:
reverseCipher.py

4. message = input('Enter message: ')

Then when you run the program, it will print the prompt to the screen and wait for the user to
type in the message and press Enter. The message that the user types in will be the string value
that is stored in the message variable:
Enter message: Hello world!
!dlrow olleH

Summary
Now that we have learned how to deal with text, we can start making programs that the user can
run and interact with. This is important because text is the main way the user and the computer
will communicate with each other.
Strings are just a different data type that we can use in our programs. We can use the + operator
to concatenate strings together. We can use indexing and slicing to create a new string from part
of a different string. The len() function takes a string argument and returns an integer of how
many characters are in the string.
The Boolean data type has only two values: True and False. Comparison operators ==, !=, <,
>, <=, and >= can compare two values and evaluate to a Boolean value.
Conditions are expression that are used in several different kinds of statements. A while loop
statement keeps executing the lines inside the block that follows it as long as its condition
evaluates to True. A block is made up of lines with the same level of indentation, including any
blocks inside of them.
A common practice in programs is to start a variable with a blank string, and then concatenate
characters to it until it “grows” into the final desired string.

Implementing a Program
In Chapter 1, we used a cipher wheel, a St. Cyr slide, and a chart of letters and numbers to
implement the Caesar cipher. In this chapter, we will use a computer program to implement the
Caesar cipher.
The reverse cipher always encrypts the same way. But the Caesar cipher uses keys, which encrypt
the message in a different way depending on which key is used. The keys for the Caesar cipher

are the integers from 0 to 25. Even if a cryptanalyst knows that the Caesar cipher was used, that
alone does not give her enough information to break the cipher. She must also know the key.

Source Code of the Caesar Cipher Program
Type in the following code into the file editor, and then save it as caesarCipher.py. Press F5 to
run the program. Note that first you will need to download the pyperclip.py module and place this
file in the same directory (that is, folder) as the caesarCipher.py file. You can download this file
from http://invpy.com/pyperclip.py

Sample Run of the Caesar Cipher Program
When you run this program, the output will look like this:
GUVF VF ZL FRPERG ZRFFNTR.

The above text is the string 'This is my secret message.' encrypted with the Caesar
cipher with key 13. The Caesar cipher program you just ran will automatically copy this
encrypted string to the clipboard so you can paste it in an email or text file. This way you can
easily take the encrypted output from the program and send it to another person.
To decrypt, just paste this text as the new value stored in the message variable on line 7. Then
change the assignment statement on line 13 to store the string 'decrypt' in the variable mode:
caesarCipher.py

THIS IS MY SECRET MESSAGE.

If you see this error message when running the program:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Python32\caesarCipher.py", line 4, in <module>
import pyperclip
ImportError: No module named pyperclip

…then you have not downloaded the pyperclip module into the right folder. If you still
cannot get the module working, just delete lines 4 and 52 (which have the text “pyperclip” in
them) from the program. This will get rid of the code that depends on the pyperclip module.

Checking Your Source Code with the Online Diff Tool

How the Program Works
Let’s go over exactly what each of the lines of code in this program does.

Importing Modules with the import Statement
caesarCipher.py

1. # Caesar Cipher
2. # http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed)
3.
4. import pyperclip

Line 4 is a new kind of statement called an import statement. While Python includes many
built-in functions, some functions exist in separate programs called modules. Modules are
Python programs that contain additional functions that can be used by your program. In this case,
we’re importing a module named pyperclip so that we can call the pyperclip.copy()
function later in this program.

74

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The import statement is made up of the import keyword followed by the module name. Line
4 is an import statement that imports the pyperclip module, which contains several
functions related to copying and pasting text to the clipboard.

caesarCipher.py

6.
7.
8.
9.

# the string to be encrypted/decrypted
message = 'This is my secret message.'
# the encryption/decryption key
key = 13
# tells the program to encrypt or decrypt
mode = 'encrypt' # set to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'

The next few lines set three variables: message will store the string to be encrypted or
decrypted, key will store the integer of the encryption key, and mode will store either the string
'encrypt' (which will cause code later in the program to encrypt the string in message) or
'decrypt' (which will tell the program to decrypt rather than encrypting).

Constants
caesarCipher.py

15. # every possible symbol that can be encrypted
16. LETTERS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

We also need a string that contains all the capital letters of the alphabet in order. It would be
tiring to type the full 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string value each time we use it in
the program (and we might make typos when typing it, which would cause errors in our
program). So instead we will type the code for the string value once and place it in a variable
named LETTERS. This string contains all the letters that our cipher program can possibly
encrypt. This set of letters (which don’t have to be just letters but can also be numbers,
punctuation, or any other symbol) is called the cipher’s symbol set. The end of this chapter will
tell you how to expand this program’s symbol set to include other characters besides letters.
The LETTERS variable name is in all capitals. This is the programming convention for constant
variables. Constants are variables whose values are not meant to be changed when the program
runs. Although we can change LETTERS just like any other variable, the all-caps reminds the
programmer to not write code that does so.

Chapter 6 – The Caesar Cipher

75

Like all conventions, we don’t have to follow it. But doing it this way makes it easier for other
programmers to understand how these variables are used. (It even can help you if you are looking
at code you wrote yourself a long time ago.)

The upper() and lower() String Methods
caesarCipher.py

18.
19.
20.
21.
22.

# stores the encrypted/decrypted form of the message
translated = ''
# capitalize the string in message
message = message.upper()

On line 19, the program stores a blank string in a variable named translated. Just like in the
reverse cipher from last chapter, by the end of the program the translated variable will
contain the completely encrypted (or decrypted) message. But for now it starts as a blank string.
Line 22 is an assignment statement that stores a value in a variable named message, but the
expression on the right side of the = operator is something we haven’t seen before:
message.upper().
This is a method call. Methods are just like functions, except they are attached to a non-module
value (or in the case of line 22, a variable containing a value) with a period. The name of this
method is upper(), and it is being called on the string value stored in the message variable.
A function is not a method just because it is in a module. You will see on line 52 that we call
pyperclip.copy(), but pyperclip is a module that was imported on line 4, so copy() is
not a method. It is just a function that is inside the pyperclip module. If this is confusing, then
you can always call methods and functions a “function” and people will know what you’re
talking about.
Most data types (such as strings) have methods. Strings have a method called upper() and
lower() which will evaluate to an uppercase or lowercase version of that string, respectively.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello world!'.upper()
'HELLO WORLD!'
>>> 'Hello world!'.lower()
'hello world!'
>>>

76

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Because the upper() method returns a string value, you can call a method on that string as
well. Try typing 'Hello world!'.upper().lower() into the shell:
>>> 'Hello world!'.upper().lower()
'hello world!'
>>>

'Hello world!'.upper() evaluates to the string 'HELLO WORLD!', and then we call
the lower() method on that string. This returns the string 'hello world!', which is the
final value in the evaluation. The order is important. 'Hello world!'.lower().upper()
is not the same as 'Hello world!'.upper().lower():
>>> 'Hello world'.lower().upper()
'HELLO WORLD!'
>>>

If a string is stored in a variable, you can call any string method (such as upper() or
lower()) on that variable. Look at this example:
>>> fizz = 'Hello world!'
>>> fizz.upper()
'HELLO WORLD!'
>>> fizz
'Hello world!'

Calling the upper() or lower() method on a string value in a variable does not change the
value inside a variable. Methods are just part of expressions that evaluate to a value. (Think about
it like this: the expression fizz + 'ABC' would not change the string stored in fizz to have
'ABC' concatenated to the end of it, unless we used it in an assignment statement like fizz =
fizz + 'ABC'.)
Different data types have different methods. You will learn about other methods as you read this
book. A list of common string methods is at http://invpy.com/stringmethods.

The for Loop Statement
caesarCipher.py

25. for symbol in message:

Chapter 6 – The Caesar Cipher

77

The for loop is very good at looping over a string or list of values (we will learn about lists
later). This is different from the while loop, which loops as long as a certain condition is True.
A for statement has six parts:
1. The for keyword.
2. A variable name.
3. The in keyword.
4. A string value (or a variable
containing a string value).
5. A colon.
6. A block of code.
Figure 6-1. The parts of a for loop statement.
Each time the program execution goes through the loop (that is, on each iteration through the
loop) the variable in the for statement takes on the value of the next character in the string.
For example, type the following into the interactive shell. Note that after you type the first line,
the >>> prompt will turn into ... (although in IDLE, it will just print three spaces) because the
shell is expecting a block of code after the for statement’s colon. In the interactive shell, the
block will end when you enter a blank line:
>>>
...
...

A while Loop Equivalent of a for Loop
The for loop is very similar to the while loop, but when you only need to iterate over
characters in a string, using a for loop is much less code to type. You can make a while loop
that acts the same way as a for loop by adding a little extra code:
>>> i = 0
>>> while i < len('Howdy'):
...
letter = 'Howdy'[i]

Notice that this while loop does the exact same thing that the for loop does, but is not as short
and simple as the for loop.
Before we can understand lines 26 to 32 of the Caesar cipher program, we need to first learn
about the if, elif, and else statements, the in and not in operators, and the find()
string method.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 6, Set B

The if Statement
An if statement can be read as “If this condition is True, execute the code in the following
block. Otherwise if it is False, skip the block.” Open the file editor and type in the following
small program. Then save the file as password.py and press F5 to run it.

print('What is the password?')
password = input()
if password == 'rosebud':
print('Access granted.')
if password != 'rosebud':
print('Access denied.')
print('Done.')

When the password = input() line is executed, the user can type in anything she wants and
it will be stored as a string in the variable password. If she typed in “rosebud” (in all lowercase
letters), then the expression password == 'rosebud' will evaluate to True and the
program execution will enter the following block to print the 'Access granted.' string.
If password == 'rosebud' is False, then this block of code is skipped. Next, the second
if statement will have its condition also evaluated. If this condition, password !=

Chapter 6 – The Caesar Cipher

79

'rosebud' is True, then the execution jumps inside of the following block to print out
'Access denied.'. If the condition is False, then this block of code is skipped.

The else Statement
Often we want to test a condition and execute one block of code if it is True and another block
of code if it is False. The previous password.py example is like this, but it used two if
statements.
An else statement can be used after an if statement’s block, and its block of code will be
executed if the if statement’s condition is False. You can read the code as “if this condition is
true, execute this block, or else execute this block.
Type in the following program and save it as password2.py. Notice that it does the same thing as
the previous password.py program, except it uses an if and else statement instead of two if
statements:

print('What is the password?')
password = input()
if password == 'rosebud':
print('Access granted.')
else:
print('Access denied.')
print('Done.')

The elif Statement
There is also an “else if” statement called the elif statement. Like an if statement, it has a
condition. Like an else statement, it follows an if (or another elif) statement and executes if
the previous if (or elif) statement’s condition was False. You can read if, elif and else
statements as, “If this condition is true, run this block. Or else, check if this next condition is true.
Or else, just run this last block.” Type in this example program into the file editor and save it as

When you run this program, the integer 12 is stored in the variable numberOfEggs. Then the
condition numberOfEggs < 4 is checked to see if it is True. If it isn’t, the execution skips
the block and checks numberOfEggs < 20. If it isn’t True, execution skips that block and
checks if numberOfEggs == 144. If all of these conditions have been False, then the
else block is executed.
Notice that one and only one of these blocks will be executed. You can have zero or more
elif statements following an if statement. You can have zero or one else statements, and the
else statement always comes last.

The in and not in Operators
An expression of two strings connected by the in operator will evaluate to True if the first
string is inside the second string. Otherwise the expression evaluates to False. Notice that the
in and not in operators are case-sensitive. Try typing the following in the interactive shell:
>>> 'hello' in 'hello world!'
True
>>> 'ello' in 'hello world!'
True
>>> 'HELLO' in 'hello world!'
False
>>> 'HELLO' in 'HELLO world!'
True
>>> '' in 'Hello'
True
>>> '' in ''
True
>>> 'D' in 'ABCDEF'
True
>>>

The not in operator will evaluate to the opposite of in. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> 'hello' not in 'hello world!'
False
>>> 'ello' not in 'hello world!'
False

>>> 'HELLO' not in 'hello world!'
True
>>> 'HELLO' not in 'HELLO world!'
False
>>> '' not in 'Hello'
False
>>> '' not in ''
False
>>> 'D' not in 'ABCDEF'
False
>>>

Expressions using the in and not in operators are handy for conditions of if statements so that
we can execute some code if a string exists inside of another string.
Also, the in keyword used in for statements is not the same as the in operator used here. They
are just typed the same.

The find() String Method
Just like the upper() method can be called on a string values, the find() method is a string
method. The find() method takes one string argument and returns the integer index of where
that string appears in the method’s string. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
1
>>>
4
>>>
>>>
0
>>>

'hello'.find('e')
'hello'.find('o')
fizz = 'hello'
fizz.find('h')

If the string argument cannot be found, the find() method returns the integer -1. Notice that
the find() method is case-sensitive. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'hello'.find('x')
-1
>>> 'hello'.find('H')
-1
>>>

82

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The string you pass as an argument to find() can be more than one character. The integer that
find() returns will be the index of the first character where the argument is found. Try typing
the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'hello'.find('ello')
1
>>> 'hello'.find('lo')
3
>>> 'hello hello'.find('e')
1
>>>

The find() string method is like a more specific version of using the in operator. It not only
tells you if a string exists in another string, but also tells you where.

Back to the Code
Now that we understand how if, elif, else statements, the in operator, and the find()
string method works, it will be easier to understand how the rest of the Caesar cipher program
works.

if symbol in LETTERS:
# get the encrypted (or decrypted) number for this symbol
num = LETTERS.find(symbol) # get the number of the symbol

If the string in symbol (which the for statement has set to be only a single character) is a
capital letter, then the condition symbol in LETTERS will be True. (Remember that on line
22 we converted message to an uppercase version with message = message.upper(), so
symbol cannot possibly be a lowercase letter.) The only time the condition is False is if
symbol is something like a punctuation mark or number string value, such as '?' or '4'.
We want to check if symbol is an uppercase letter because our program will only encrypt (or
decrypt) uppercase letters. Any other character will be added to the translated string without
being encrypted (or decrypted).

There is a new block that starts after the if statement on line 26. If you look down the program,
you will notice that this block stretches all the way to line 42. The else statement on line 44 is
paired to the if statement on line 26.
caesarCipher.py

if mode == 'encrypt':
num = num + key
elif mode == 'decrypt':
num = num - key

Now that we have the current symbol’s number stored in num, we can do the encryption or
decryption math on it. The Caesar cipher adds the key number to the letter’s number to encrypt it,
or subtracts the key number from the letter’s number to decrypt it.
The mode variable contains a string that tells the program whether or not it should be encrypting
or decrypting. If this string is 'encrypt', then the condition for line 29’s if statement will be
True and line 30 will be executed (and the block after the elif statement will be skipped). If
this string is any other value besides 'encrypt', then the condition for line 29’s if statement
is False and the program execution moves on to check the elif statement’s condition.
This is how our program knows when to encrypt (where it is adding the key) or decrypt (where it
is subtracting the key). If the programmer made an error and stored 'pineapples' in the
mode variable on line 13, then both of the conditions on lines 29 and 31 would be False and
nothing would happen to the value stored in num. (You can try this yourself by changing line 13
and re-running the program.)

# handle the wrap-around if num is larger than the length of
# LETTERS or less than 0
if num >= len(LETTERS):
num = num - len(LETTERS)
elif num < 0:
num = num + len(LETTERS)

Remember that when we were implementing the Caesar cipher with paper and pencil, sometimes
the number after adding or subtracting the key would be greater than or equal to 26 or less than 0.
In those cases, we had to add or subtract 26 to the number to “wrap-around” the number. This
“wrap-around” is what lines 36 to 39 do for our program.

84

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

If num is greater than or equal to 26, then the condition on line 36 is True and line 37 is
executed (and the elif statement on line 38 is skipped). Otherwise, Python will check if num is
less than 0. If that condition is True, then line 39 is executed.
The Caesar cipher adds or subtracts 26 because that is the number of letters in the alphabet. If
English only had 25 letters, then the “wrap-around” would be done by adding or subtracting 25.
Notice that instead of using the integer value 26 directly, we use len(LETTERS). The function
call len(LETTERS) will return the integer value 26, so this code works just as well. But the
reason that we use len(LETTERS) instead of 26 is that the code will work no matter what
characters we have in LETTERS.
We can modify the value stored in LETTERS so that we encrypt and decrypt more than just the
uppercase letters. How this is done will be explained at the end of this chapter.

# add encrypted/decrypted number's symbol at the end of translated
translated = translated + LETTERS[num]

Now that the integer in num has been modified, it will be the index of the encrypted (or
decrypted) letter in LETTERS. We want to add this encrypted/decrypted letter to the end of the
translated string, so line 42 uses string concatenation to add it to the end of the current value
of translated.
caesarCipher.py

else:
# just add the symbol without encrypting/decrypting
translated = translated + symbol

Line 44 has four spaces of indentation. If you look at the indentation of the lines above, you’ll see
that this means it comes after the if statement on line 26. There’s a lot of code in between this
if and else statement, but it all belongs in the block of code that follows the if statement on
line 26. If that if statement’s condition was False, then the block would have been skipped and
the program execution would enter the else statement’s block starting at line 46. (Line 45 is
skipped because it is a comment.)
This block has just one line in it. It adds the symbol string as it is to the end of translated.
This is how non-letter strings like ' ' or '.' are added to the translated string without being
encrypted or decrypted.

Displaying and Copying the Encrypted/Decrypted String

51.
52.

# print the encrypted/decrypted string to the screen
print(translated)
# copy the encrypted/decrypted string to the clipboard
pyperclip.copy(translated)

Line 49 has no indentation, which means it is the first line after the block that started on line 26
(the for loop’s block). By the time the program execution reaches line 49, it has looped through
each character in the message string, encrypted (or decrypted) the characters, and added them to
translated.
Line 49 will call the print() function to display the translated string on the screen. Notice
that this is the only print() call in the entire program. The computer does a lot of work
encrypting every letter in message, handling wrap-around, and handling non-letter characters.
But the user doesn’t need to see this. The user just needs to see the final string in translated.
Line 52 calls a function that is inside the pyperclip module. The function’s name is copy()
and it takes one string argument. Because copy() is a function in the pyperclip module, we
have to tell Python this by putting pyperclip. in front of the function name. If we type
copy(translated) instead of pyperclip.copy(translated), Python will give us an
error message.
You can see this error message for yourself by typing this code in the interactive shell:
>>> copy('Hello')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'copy' is not defined
>>>

Also, if you forget the import pyperclip line before trying to call pyperclip.copy(),
Python will give an error message. Try typing this into the interactive shell:
>>> pyperclip.copy('Hello')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'pyperclip' is not defined
>>>

86

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

That’s the entire Caesar cipher program. When you run it, notice how your computer can execute
the entire program and encrypt the string in less than a second. Even if you type in a very, very
long string for the value to store in the message variable, your computer can encrypt or decrypt
a message within a second or two. Compare this to the several minutes it would take to do this
with a cipher wheel or St. Cyr slide. The program even copies the encrypted text to the clipboard
so the user can simply paste it into an email to send to someone.

Encrypt Non-Letter Characters
One problem with the Caesar cipher that we’ve implemented is that it cannot encrypt non-letters.
For example, if you encrypt the string 'The password is 31337.' with the key 20, it will
encrypt to 'Dro zkccgybn sc 31337.' This encrypted message doesn’t keep the
password in the message very secret. However, we can modify the program to encrypt other
characters besides letters.
If you change the string that is stored in LETTERS to include more than just the uppercase letters,
then the program will encrypt them as well. This is because on line 26, the condition symbol
in LETTERS will be True. The value of num will be the index of symbol in this new, larger
LETTERS constant variable. The “wrap-around” will need to add or subtract the number of
characters in this new string, but that’s already handled because we use len(LETTERS) instead
of typing in 26 directly into the code. (This is why we programmed it this way.)
The only changes you have to make are to the LETTERS assignment statement on line 16 and
commenting out line 22 which capitalizes all the letters in message.
caesarCipher.py

15. # every possible symbol that can be encrypted
16. LETTERS = ' !"#$%&\'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]
^_`a bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~'
17.
18. # stores the encrypted/decrypted form of the message
19. translated = ''
20.
21. # capitalize the string in message
22. #message = message.upper()

Notice that this new string has the escape characters \' and \\ in it. You can download this new
version of the program from http://invpy.com/caesarCipher2.py.
This modification to our program is like if we had a cipher wheel or St. Cyr slide that had not
only uppercase letters but numbers, punctuation, and lowercase letters on it as well.

Even though the value for LETTERS has to be the same when running the program for decryption
as when it encrypted the message, this value doesn’t have to be secret. Only the key needs to be
kept secret, while the rest of program (including the code for the Caesar cipher program) can be
shared with the world.

Summary
You’ve had to learn several programming concepts and read through quite a few chapters to get
to this point, but now you have a program that implements a secret cipher. And more importantly,
you can understand how this code works.
Modules are Python programs that contain useful functions we can use. To use these functions,
you must first import them with an import statement. To call functions in an imported module,
put the module name and a period before the function name, like: module.function().
Constant variables are by convention written in UPPERCASE. These variables are not meant to
have their value changed (although nothing prevents the programmer from writing code that does
this). Constants are helpful because they give a “name” to specific values in your program.
Methods are functions that are attached to a value of a certain data type. The upper() and
lower() string methods return an uppercase or lowercase version of the string they are called
on. The find() string method returns an integer of where the string argument passed to it can
be found in the string it is called on.
A for loop will iterate over all the characters in string value, setting a variable to each character
on each iteration. The if, elif, and else statements can execute blocks of code based on
whether a condition is True or False.
The in and not in operators can check if one string is or isn’t in another string, and evaluates
to True or False accordingly.
Knowing how to program gives you the power to take a process like the Caesar cipher and put it
down in a language that a computer can understand. And once the computer understands how to
do it, it can do it much faster than any human can and with no mistakes (unless there are mistakes
in your programming.) This is an incredibly useful skill, but it turns out the Caesar cipher can
easily be broken by someone who knows computer programming. In the next chapter we will use
our skills to write a Caesar cipher “hacker” so we can read ciphertext that other people encrypted.
So let’s move on to the next chapter, and learn how to hack encryption.

HACKING THE CAESAR CIPHER
WITH THE BRUTE-FORCE
TECHNIQUE
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 Kerckhoffs’s Principle and Shannon’s Maxim
 The brute-force technique
 The range() function
 String formatting (string interpolation)

Hacking Ciphers
We can hack the Caesar cipher by using a cryptanalytic technique called “brute-force”. Because
our code breaking program is so effective against the Caesar cipher, you shouldn’t use it to
encrypt your secret information.
Ideally, the ciphertext would never fall into anyone’s hands. But Kerckhoffs’s Principle (named
after the19th-century cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs) says that a cipher should still be secure
even if everyone else knows how the cipher works and has the ciphertext (that is, everything
except the key). This was restated by the 20th century mathematician Claude Shannon as
Shannon’s Maxim: “The enemy knows the system.”

The Brute-Force Attack
Nothing stops a cryptanalyst from guessing one key, decrypting the ciphertext with that key,
looking at the output, and if it was not the correct key then moving on to the next key. The
technique of trying every possible decryption key is called a brute-force attack. It isn’t a very
sophisticated hack, but through sheer effort (which the computer will do for us) the Caesar cipher
can be broken.

Source Code of the Caesar Cipher Hacker Program
Open a new file editor window by clicking on File ► New Window. Type in the following code
into the file editor, and then save it as caesarHacker.py. Press F5 to run the program. Note that
first you will need to download the pyperclip.py module and place this file in the same directory
as the caesarHacker.py file. You can download this file from http://invpy.com/pyperclip.py.

print('Key #%s: %s' % (key, translated))

You will see that much of this code is the same as the code in the original Caesar cipher program.
This is because the Caesar cipher hacker program does the same steps to decrypt the key.

Sample Run of the Caesar Cipher Hacker Program
Here is what the Caesar cipher program looks like when you run it. It is trying to break the
ciphertext, “GUVF VF ZL FRPERG ZRFFNTR.” Notice that the decrypted output for key 13 is

# Caesar Cipher Hacker
# http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed)
message = 'GUVF VF ZL FRPERG ZRFFNTR.'
LETTERS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

The hacker program will create a message variable that stores the ciphertext string the program
tries to decrypt. The LETTERS constant variable contains every character that can be encrypted
with the cipher. The value for LETTERS needs to be exactly the same as the value for LETTERS
used in the Caesar cipher program that encrypted the ciphertext we are trying to hack, otherwise
the hacker program won’t work.

The range() Function
caesarHacker.py

7. # loop through every possible key
8. for key in range(len(LETTERS)):

92

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Line 8 is a for loop that does not iterate over a string value, but instead iterates over the return
value from a call to a function named range(). The range() function takes one integer
argument and returns a value of the range data type. These range values can be used in for loops
to loop a specific number of times. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> for i in range(4):
...
print('Hello')
...
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
>>>

More specifically, the range value returned from the range() function call will set the for
loop’s variable to the integers 0 up to, but not including, the argument passed to range(). Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> for i in range(6):
...
print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4
5
>>>

Line 8 is a for loop that will set the key variable with the values 0 up to (but not including) 26.
Instead of hard-coding the value 26 directly into our program, we use the return value from
len(LETTERS) so that if we modify LETTERS the program will still work. See the “Encrypt
Non-Letter Characters” section in the last chapter to read why.
So the first time the program execution goes through this loop, key will be set to 0 and the
ciphertext in message will be decrypted with key 0. (The code inside the for loop does the
decrypting.) On the next iteration of line 8’s for loop, key will be set to 1 for the decryption.
You can also pass two integer arguments to the range() function instead of just one. The first
argument is where the range should start and the second argument is where the range should stop
(up to but not including the second argument). The arguments are separated by a comma:

93

>>> for i in range(2, 6):
...
print(i)
...
2
3
4
5
>>>

The range() call evaluates to a value of the “range object” data type.

9.
10.
# It is important to set translated to the blank string so that the
11.
# previous iteration's value for translated is cleared.
12.
translated = ''

On line 12, translated is set to the blank string. The decryption code on the next few lines
adds the decrypted text to the end of the string in translated. It is important that we reset
translated to the blank string at the beginning of this for loop, otherwise the decrypted text will
be added to the decrypted text in translated from the last iteration in the loop.

# The rest of the program is the same as the original Caesar program:
# run the encryption/decryption code on each symbol in the message
for symbol in message:
if symbol in LETTERS:
num = LETTERS.find(symbol) # get the number of the symbol

Lines 17 to 31 are almost exactly the same as the code in the Caesar cipher program from the last
chapter. It is slightly simpler, because this code only has to decrypt instead of decrypt or encrypt.
First we loop through every symbol in the ciphertext string stored in message on line 17. On
each iteration of this loop, line 18 checks if symbol is an uppercase letter (that is, it exists in the
LETTERS constant variable which only has uppercase letters) and, if so, decrypts it. Line 19

94

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

locates where symbol is in LETTERS with the find() method and stores it in a variable called
num.
caesarHacker.py

20.
21.
22.
23.
24.

num = num - key
# handle the wrap-around if num is 26 or larger or less than 0
if num < 0:
num = num + len(LETTERS)

Then we subtract the key from num on line 20. (Remember, in the Caesar cipher, subtracting the
key decrypts and adding the key encrypts.) This may cause num to be less than zero and require
“wrap-around”. Line 23 checks for this case and adds 26 (which is what len(LETTERS)
returns) if it was less than 0.
caesarHacker.py

26.
27.

# add number's symbol at the end of translated
translated = translated + LETTERS[num]

Now that num has been modified, LETTERS[num] will evaluate to the decrypted symbol. Line
27 adds this symbol to the end of the string stored in translated.
caesarHacker.py

29.
30.
31.

else:
# just add the symbol without encrypting/decrypting
translated = translated + symbol

Of course, if the condition for line 18’s condition was False and symbol was not in
LETTERS, we don’t decrypt the symbol at all. If you look at the indentation of line 29’s else
statement, you can see that this else statement matches the if statement on line 18.
Line 31 just adds symbol to the end of translated unmodified.

String Formatting
caesarHacker.py

33.
34.

# display the current key being tested, along with its decryption
print('Key #%s: %s' % (key, translated))

Although line 34 is the only print() function call in our Caesar cipher hacker program, it will
print out several lines because it gets called once per iteration of line 8’s for loop.

95

The argument for the print() function call is something we haven’t used before. It is a string
value that makes use of string formatting (also called string interpolation). String formatting
with the %s text is a way of placing one string inside another one. The first %s text in the string
gets replaced by the first value in the parentheses after the % at the end of the string.
Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello %s!' % ('world')
'Hello world!'
>>> 'Hello ' + 'world' + '!'
'Hello world!'
>>> 'The %s ate the %s that ate the %s.' % ('dog', 'cat', 'rat')
'The dog ate the cat that ate the rat.'
>>>

String formatting is often easier to type than string concatenation with the + operator, especially
for larger strings. And one benefit of string formatting is that, unlike string concatenation, you
can insert non-string values such as integers into the string. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> '%s had %s pies.' % ('Alice', 42)
'Alice had 42 pies.'
>>> 'Alice' + ' had ' + 42 + ' pies.'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly

Line 34 uses string formatting to create a string that has the values in both the key and
translated variables. Because key stores an integer value, we’ll use string formatting to put
it in a string value that is passed to print().

Summary
The critical failure of the Caesar cipher is that there aren’t that many different possible keys that
can be used to encrypt a message. Any computer can easily decrypt with all 26 possible keys, and
it only takes the cryptanalyst a few seconds to look through them to find the one that is in
English. To make our messages more secure, we will need a cipher that has more possible keys.
That transposition cipher in the next chapter can provide this for us.

ENCRYPTING WITH THE
TRANSPOSITION CIPHER
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 Creating functions with def statements.
 main() functions
 Parameters
 The global and local scope, and global and local variables
 The global statement
 The list data type, and how lists and strings are similar
 The list() function
 Lists of lists
 Augmented assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)
 The join() string method
 Return values and the return statement
 The special __name__ variable
The Caesar cipher isn’t secure. It doesn’t take much for a computer to brute-force through all
twenty-six possible keys. The transposition cipher has many more possible keys to make a bruteforce attack more difficult.

Encrypting with the Transposition Cipher
Instead of replacing characters with other characters, the transposition cipher jumbles up the
message’s symbols into an order that makes the original message unreadable. Before we start
writing code, let’s encrypt the message “Common sense is not so common.” with pencil and

paper. Including the spaces and punctuation, this message has 30 characters. We will use the
number 8 for the key.
The first step is to draw out a number of boxes equal to the key. We will draw 8 boxes since our
key for this example is 8:

The second step is to start writing the message you want to encrypt into the boxes, with one
character for each box. Remember that spaces are a character (this book marks the boxes with (s)
to indicate a space so it doesn’t look like an empty box).
C

o

m

m

o

n

(s)

s

We only have 8 boxes but there are 30 characters in the message. When you run out of boxes,
draw another row of 8 boxes under the first row. Keep creating new rows until you have written
out the full message:
1st
C
e
n
o

2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th
o m m o
n (s) s
n
s
e (s) i
s (s)
o
t (s) s
o (s) c
m m o
n
.

We shade in the two boxes in the last row to remind us to ignore them. The ciphertext is the
letters read from the top left box going down the column. “C”, “e”, “n”, and “o” are from the 1st
column. When you get to the last row of a column, move to the top row of the next column to the
right. The next characters are “o”, “n”, “o”, “m”. Ignore the shaded boxes.
The ciphertext is “Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c”, which is sufficiently scrambled to keep
someone from figuring out the original message by looking at it.
The steps for encrypting are:
1. Count the number of characters in the message and the key.
2. Draw a number of boxes equal to the key in a single row. (For example, 12 boxes for a
key of 12.)
3. Start filling in the boxes from left to right, with one character per box.
4. When you run out of boxes and still have characters left, add another row of boxes.

98

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

5. Shade in the unused boxes in the last row.
6. Starting from the top left and going down, write out the characters. When you get to the
bottom of the column, move to the next column to the right. Skip any shaded boxes. This
will be the ciphertext.

A Transposition Cipher Encryption Program
Encrypting with paper and pencil involves a lot of work and it’s easy to make mistakes. Let’s
look at a program that can implement transposition cipher encryption (a decryption program will
be demonstrated later in this chapter).
Using the computer program has a slight problem, however. If the ciphertext has space characters
at the end, then it is impossible to see them since a space is just empty… well, space. To fix this,
the program adds a | character at the end of the ciphertext. (The | character is called the “pipe”
character and is above the Enter key on your keyboard.) For example:
Hello|
# There are no spaces at the end of the message.
Hello | # There is one space at the end of the message.
Hello | # There are two spaces at the end of the message.

Sample Run of the Transposition Cipher Encryption Program
When you run the above program, it produces this output:
Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c|

This ciphertext (without the pipe character at the end) is also copied to the clipboard, so you can
paste it into an email to someone. If you want to encrypt a different message or use a different

100

key, change the value assigned to the myMessage and myKey variables on lines 7 and 8. Then
run the program again.

How the Program Works
transpositionEncrypt.py

1. # Transposition Cipher Encryption
2. # http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed)

4. import pyperclip

The transposition cipher program, like the Caesar cipher program, will copy the encrypted text to
the clipboard. So first we will import the pyperclip module so it can call
pyperclip.copy().

Creating Your Own Functions with def Statements
transpositionEncrypt.py

6. def main():
7.
myMessage = 'Common sense is not so common.'
8.
myKey = 8

A function (like print()) is a sort of mini-program in your program. When the function is
called, the execution moves to the code inside that function and then returns to the line after the
function call. You can create your own functions with a def statement like the one on line 6.
The def statement on line 6 isn't a call to a function named main(). Instead, the def statement
means we are creating, or defining, a new function named main() that we can call later in our
program. When the execution reaches the def statement Python will define this function. We can
then call it the same way we call other functions. When we call this function, the execution
moves inside of the block of code following the def statement.
Open a new file editor window and type the following code into it:

101

9. print('Done.')

Save this program with the name helloFunction.py and run it by pressing F5. The output looks
like this:
Start!
Hello!
42 plus 1 is 43
Call it again.
Hello!
42 plus 1 is 43
Done.

When the helloFunction.py program runs, the execution starts at the top. The first line is a def
statement that defines the hello() function. The execution skips the block after the def
statement and executes the print('Start!') line. This is why 'Start!' is the first string
printed when we run the program.
The next line after print('Start!') is a function call to our hello() function. The
program execution jumps to the first line in the hello() function’s block on line 2. This
function will cause the strings 'Hello!' and '42 plus 1 is 43' to be printed to the
screen.
When the program execution reaches the bottom of the def statement, the execution will jump
back to the line after the line that originally called the function (line 7). In helloFunction.py, this
is the print('Call it again.') line. Line 8 is another call to the hello() function. The
program execution will jump back into the hello() function and execute the code there again.
This is why 'Hello!' and '42 plus 1 is 43' are displayed on the screen two times.
After that function returns to line 9, the print('Done.') line executes. This is the last line in
our program, so the program exits.

The Program’s main() Function
transpositionEncrypt.py

6. def main():
7.
myMessage = 'Common sense is not so common.'
8.
myKey = 8

102

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The rest of the programs in this book have a function named main() which is called at the start
of program. The reason is explained at the end of this chapter, but for now just know that the
main() function in the programs in this book are always called soon after the programs are run.
On lines 7 and 8, the variables myMessage and myKey will store the plaintext message to
encrypt and the key used to do the encryption.
transpositionEncrypt.py

10.

ciphertext = encryptMessage(myKey, myMessage)

The code that does the actual encrypting will be put into a function we define on line 21 named
encryptMessage(). This function will take two arguments: an integer value for the key and a
string value for the message to encrypt. When passing multiple arguments to a function call,
separate the arguments with a comma.
The return value of encryptMessage() will be a string value of the encrypted ciphertext.
(The code in this function is explained next.) This string will be stored in a variable named
ciphertext.
transpositionEncrypt.py

# Print the encrypted string in ciphertext to the screen, with
# a | (called "pipe" character) after it in case there are spaces at
# the end of the encrypted message.
print(ciphertext + '|')
# Copy the encrypted string in ciphertext to the clipboard.
pyperclip.copy(ciphertext)

The ciphertext message is printed to the screen on line 15 and copied to the clipboard on line 18.
The program prints a | character (called the “pipe” character) at the end of the message so that the
user can see any empty space characters at the end of the ciphertext.
Line 18 is the last line of the main() function. After it executes, the program execution will
return to the line after the line that called it. The call to main() is on line 45 and is the last line
in the program, so after execution returns from main() the program will exit.

Parameters
transpositionEncrypt.py

21. def encryptMessage(key, message):

Chapter 8 – The Transposition Cipher, Encrypting

103

The code in the encryptMessage() function does the actual encryption. The key and
message text in between the parentheses next to encryptMessage()’s def statement
shows that the encryptMessage() function takes two parameters.

Parameters are the variables that contain the arguments passed when a function is called.
Parameters are automatically deleted when the function returns. (This is just like how variables
are forgotten when a program exits.)
When the encryptMessage() function gets called from line 10, two argument values are
passed (on line 10, they are the values in myKey and myMessage). These values get assigned to
the parameters key and message (which you can see on line 21) when the execution moves to
the top of the function.
A parameter is a variable name in between the parentheses in the def statement. An
argument is a value that is passed in between the parentheses for a function call.
Python will raise an error message if you try to call a function with too many or too few
arguments for the number of parameters the function has. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> len('hello', 'world')
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: len() takes exactly one argument (2 given)
>>> len()
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: len() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
>>>

Changes to Parameters Only Exist Inside the Function
Look at the following program, which defines and then calls a function named func():
def func(param):
param = 42
spam = 'Hello'
func(spam)
print(spam)

When you run this program, the print() call on the last line will print out 'Hello', not 42.
When func() is called with spam as the argument, the spam variable is not being sent into the

104

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

func() function and having 42 assigned to it. Instead, the value inside spam is being copied
and assigned to param. Any changes made to param inside the function will not change the
value in the spam variable.
(There is an exception to this rule when you are passing something called a list or dictionary
value, but this will be explained in chapter 10 in the “List References” section.)
This is an important idea to understand. The argument value that is “passed” in a function call is
copied to the parameter. So if the parameter is changed, the variable that provided the argument
value is not changed.

Variables in the Global and Local Scope
You might wonder why we even have the key and message parameters to begin with, since we
already have the variables myKey and myMessage from the main() function. The reason is
because myKey and myMessage are in the main() function’s local scope and can’t be used
outside of the main() function.
Every time a function is called, a local scope is created. Variables created during a function call
exist in this local scope. Parameters always exist in a local scope. When the function returns, the
local scope is destroyed and the local variables are forgotten. A variable in the local scope is still
a separate variable from a global scope variable even if the two variables have the same name.
Variables created outside of every function exist in the global scope. When the program exits,
the global scope is destroyed and all the variables in the program are forgotten. (All the variables
in the reverse cipher and Caesar cipher programs were global.)

The global Statement
If you want a variable that is assigned inside a function to be a global variable instead of a local
variable, put a global statement with the variable’s name as the first line after the def
statement.
Here are the rules for whether a variable is a global variable (that is, a variable that exists in the
global scope) or local variable (that is, a variable that exists in a function call’s local scope):
1. Variables outside of all functions are always global variables.
2. If a variable in a function is never used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable.
3. If a variable in a function is not used in a global statement and but is used in an
assignment statement, it is a local variable.
4. If a variable in a function is used in a global statement, it is a global variable when
used in that function.

CRASH()
File "C:\scope.py", line 16, in CRASH

106

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

print(spam)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'spam' referenced before assignment

When the spam variable is used on lines 1, 19, 21, 23, 25 it is outside of all functions, so this is
the global variable named spam. In the eggs() function, the spam variable is assigned the
integer 99 on line 4, so Python regards this spam variable as a local variable named spam.
Python considers this local variable to be completely different from the global variable that is also
named spam. Being assigned 99 on line 4 has no effect on the value stored in the global spam
variable since they are different variables (they just happen to have the same name).
The spam variable in the ham() function on line 8 is never used in an assignment statement in
that function, so it is the global variable spam.
The spam variable in the bacon() function is used in a global statement, so we know it is
the global variable named spam. The spam = 0 assignment statement on line 13 will change the
value of the global spam variable.
The spam variable in the CRASH() function is used in an assignment statement (and not in a
global statement) so the spam variable in that function is a local variable. However, notice that
it is used in the print() function call on line 16 before it is assigned a value on line 17. This is
why calling the CRASH() function causes our program to crash with the error,
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'spam' referenced before
assignment.
It can be confusing to have global and local variables with the same name, so even if you
remember the rules for how to tell global and local variables apart, you would be better off using
different names.

The List Data Type

# Each string in ciphertext represents a column in the grid.

Line 23 uses a new data type called the list data type. A list value can contain other values. Just
like how strings begin and end with quotes, a list value begins with a [ open bracket and ends

with ] close bracket. The values stored inside the list are typed within the brackets. If there is
more than one value in the list, the values are separated by commas.

107

108

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> animals = ['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>> animals
['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>>

The animals variable stores a list value, and in this list value are four string values. The
individual values inside of a list are also called items. Lists are very good when we have to store
lots and lots of values, but we don't want variables for each one. Otherwise we would have
something like this:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>

animals1
animals2
animals3
animals4

=
=
=
=

'aardvark'
'anteater'
'antelope'
'albert'

This makes working with all the strings as a group very hard, especially if you have hundreds,
thousands, or millions of different values that you want stored in a list.
Many of the things you can do with strings will also work with lists. For example, indexing
and slicing work on list values the same way they work on string values. Instead of individual
characters in a string, the index refers to an item in a list. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> animals = ['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>> animals[0]
'aardvark'
>>> animals[1]
'anteater'
>>> animals[2]
'antelope'
>>> animals[3]
'albert'
>>> animals[1:3]
['anteater', 'antelope']
>>>

Remember, the first index is 0 and not 1. While using slices with a string value will give you a
string value of part of the original string, using slices with a list value will give you a list value of
part of the original list.

Chapter 8 – The Transposition Cipher, Encrypting

109

A for loop can also iterate over the values in a list, just like it iterates over the characters in a
string. The value that is stored in the for loop’s variable is a single value from the list. Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
...
...
For
For
For
For
>>>

for spam in ['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']:
print('For dinner we are cooking ' + spam)
dinner

we

are

Using the list() Function to Convert Range Objects to Lists
If you need a list value that has increasing integer amounts, you could have code like this to build
up a list value using a for loop:
>>>
>>>
...
...
>>>
[0,
>>>

myList = []
for i in range(10):
myList = myList + [i]
myList
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

However, it is simpler to directly make a list from a range object that the range() function
returned by using the list() function:
>>> myList = list(range(10))
>>> myList
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>>

The list() function can also convert strings into a list value. The list will have several singlecharacter strings that were in the original string:
>>> myList = list('Hello world!')
>>> myList
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!']
>>>

110

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

We won’t be using the list() function on strings or range objects in this program, but it will
come up in later in this book.

Reassigning the Items in Lists
The items inside a list can also be modified. Use the index with a normal assignment statement.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> animals = ['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>> animals
['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>> animals[2] = 9999
>>> animals
['aardvark', 'anteater', 9999, 'albert']
>>>

Reassigning Characters in Strings
While you can reassign items in a list, you cannot reassign a character in a string value. Try
typing the following code into the interactive shell to cause this error:
>>> 'Hello world!'[6] = 'x'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
>>>

To change a character in a string, use slicing instead. Try typing the following into the interactive
shell:
>>> spam = 'Hello world!'
>>> spam = spam[:6] + 'x' + spam[7:]
>>> spam
'Hello xorld!'
>>>

Lists of Lists
List values can even contain other list values. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = [['dog', 'cat'], [1, 2, 3]]
>>> spam[0]
['dog', 'cat']
>>> spam[0][0]

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 8 – The Transposition Cipher, Encrypting

111

'dog'
>>> spam[0][1]
'cat'
>>> spam[1][0]
1
>>> spam[1][1]
2
>>>

The double index brackets used for spam[0][0] work because spam[0] evaluates to
['dog', 'cat'] and ['dog', 'cat'][0] evaluates to 'dog'. You could even use
another set of index brackets, since string values also use them:
>>> spam = [['dog', 'cat'], [1, 2, 3]]
>>> spam[0][1][1]
'a'
>>>

Say we had a list of lists stored in a variable named x. Here are the indexes for each of the items
in x. Notice that x[0], x[1], x[2], and x[3] refer to list values:

Figure 8-1. A list of lists with every item’s index labeled.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 8, Set C

Using len() and the in Operator with Lists
We’ve used the len() function to tell us how many characters are in a string (that is, the length
of the string). The len() function also works on list values and returns an integer of how many
items are in the list.

112

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> animals = ['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>> len(animals)
4
>>>

We’ve used the in operator to tell us if a string exists inside another string value. The in
operator also works for checking if a value exists in a list. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> animals = ['aardvark', 'anteater', 'antelope', 'albert']
>>> 'anteater' in animals
True
>>> 'anteater' not in animals
False
>>> 'anteat' in animals
False
>>> 'delicious spam' in animals
False
>>>

Just like how a set of quotes next to each other represents the blank string value, a set of brackets
next to each other represents a blank list. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> animals = []
>>> len(animals)
0
>>>

List Concatenation and Replication with the + and * Operators
Just like how the + and * operators can concatenate and replicate strings, the same operators can
concatenate and replicate lists. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> ['hello'] + ['world']
['hello', 'world']
>>> ['hello'] * 5
['hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello']
>>>

That’s enough about the similarities between strings and lists. Just remember that most things you
can do with string values will also work with list values.

out the boxes with pencil and paper, it would look like this:
C
e
n
o

o
n
o
m

m
s
t
m

m o
e (s)
(s) s
o
n

n
i
o
.

(s) s
s (s)
(s) c

Add the index of each letter in the string to the boxes. (Remember, indexes begin with 0, not 1.)
C o m
0 1 2
e
n
s
8 9 10
n o
t
16 17 18
o m m
24 25 26

m o
n (s) s
3
4
5 6
7
e (s) i
s (s)
11 12 13 14 15
(s) s
o (s) c
19 20 21 22 23
o
n
.
27 28 29

We can see from these boxes that the first column has the characters at indexes 0, 8, 16, and 24
(which are 'C', 'e', 'n', and 'o'). The next column has the characters at indexes 1, 9, 17,
and 25 (which are 'o', 'n', 'o' and 'm'). We can see a pattern emerging: The nth column
will have all the characters in the string at indexes 0 + n, 8 + n, 16 + n, and 24 + n:
C
o
m
m
o
n
(s)
s
0+0=0
1+0=1
2+0=2
3+0=3
4+0=4
5+0=5
6+0=6
7+0=7
e
n
s
e
(s)
i
s
(s)
0+8=8
1+8=9
2+8=10
3+8=11
4+8=12
5+8=13 6+8=14 7+8=15
n
o
t
(s)
s

(s)
c
0+16=16 1+16=17 2+16=18 3+16=19 4+16=20 5+16=21 6+16=22 7+16=23
o
m
m
o
n
.
0+24=24 1+24=25 2+24=26 3+24=27 4+24=28 5+24=29
There is an exception for the 6th and 7th columns, since 24 + 6 and 24 + 7 are greater than 29,
which is the largest index in our string. In those cases, we only use 0, 8, and 16 to add to n (and
skip 24).

114

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

What’s so special about the numbers 0, 8, 16, and 24? These are the numbers we get when,
starting from 0, we add the key (which in this example is 8). 0 + 8 is 8, 8 + 8 is 16, 16 + 8 is 24.
24 + 8 would be 32, but since 32 is larger than the length of the message, we stop at 24.
So, for the nth column’s string we start at index n, and then keep adding 8 (which is the key) to get
the next index. We keep adding 8 as long as the index is less than 30 (the message length), at
which point we move to the next column.
If we imagine a list of 8 strings where each string is made up of the characters in each column,
then the list value would look like this:
['Ceno', 'onom', 'mstm', 'me o', 'o sn', 'nio.', ' s ', 's c']

This is how we can simulate the boxes in Python code. First, we will make a list of blank strings.
This list will have a number of blank strings equal to the key because each string will represent a
column of our paper-and-pencil boxes. (Our list will have 8 blank strings since we are using the
key 8 in our example.) Let’s look at the code.
transpositionEncrypt.py

22.
23.

# Each string in ciphertext represents a column in the grid.
ciphertext = [''] * key

The ciphertext variable will be a list of string values. Each string in the ciphertext
variable will represent a column of the grid. So ciphertext[0] is the leftmost column,
ciphertext[1] is the column to the right of that, and so on.
The string values will have all the characters that go into one column of the grid. Let’s look again
at the grid from the “Common sense is not so common.” example earlier in this chapter (with
column numbers added to the top):
0
C
e
n
o

1
o
n
o
m

2

m o
e (s)
(s) s
o
n

5
n
i
o
.

6
7
(s) s
s (s)
(s) c

The ciphertext variable for this grid would look like this:
>>> ciphertext = ['Ceno', 'onom', 'mstm', 'me o', 'o sn', 'nio.', ' s ', 's c']
>>> ciphertext[0]
'Ceno'

The first step to making this list is to create as many blank strings in the ciphertext list as
there are columns. Since the number of columns is equal to the key, we can use list replication to
multiply a list with one blank string value in it by the value in key. This is how line 23 evaluates
to a list with the correct number of blank strings.
transpositionEncrypt.py

25.
26.
27.

# Loop through each column in ciphertext.
for col in range(key):
pointer = col

The next step is to add text to each string in ciphertext. The for loop on line 26 will iterate
once for each column, and the col variable will have the correct integer value to use for the
index to ciphertext. The col variable will be set to 0 for the first iteration through the for
loop, then 1 on the second iteration, then 2 and so on. This way the expression
ciphertext[col] will be the string for the colth column of the grid.
Meanwhile, the pointer variable will be used as the index for the string value in the message
variable. On each iteration through the loop, pointer will start at the same value as col (which
is what line 27 does.)

Augmented Assignment Operators
Often when you are assigning a new value to a variable, you want it to be based off of the
variable’s current value. To do this you use the variable as the part of the expression that is
evaluated and assigned to the variable, like this example in the interactive shell:
>>> spam = 40
>>> spam = spam + 2
>>> print(spam)
42
>>>

But you can instead use the += augmented assignment operator as a shortcut. Try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
>>>
42
>>>
>>>
>>>

spam = 40
spam += 2
print(spam)
spam = 'Hello'
spam += ' world!'
print(spam)

116

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Hello world!
>>> spam = ['dog']
>>> spam += ['cat']
>>> print(spam)
['dog', 'cat']
>>>

The statement spam += 2 does the exact same thing as spam = spam + 2. It’s just a little
shorter to type. The += operator works with integers to do addition, strings to do string
concatenation, and lists to do list concatenation. Table 8-1 shows the augmented assignment
operators and what they are equivalent to:

# Keep looping until pointer goes past the length of the message.
while pointer < len(message):
# Place the character at pointer in message at the end of the
# current column in the ciphertext list.
ciphertext[col] += message[pointer]
# move pointer over
pointer += key

Inside the for loop that started on line 26 is a while loop that starts on line 30. For each
column, we want to loop through the original message variable and pick out every keyth
character. (In the example we’ve been using, we want every 8th character since we are using a key
of 8.) On line 27 for the first iteration of the for loop, pointer was set to 0.
While the value in pointer is less than the length of the message string, we want to add the
character at message[pointer] to the end of the colth string in ciphertext. We add 8
(that is, the value in key) to pointer each time through the loop on line 36. The first time it is
message[0], the second time message[8], the third time message[16], and the fourth
time message[24]. Each of these single character strings are concatenated to the end of

ciphertext[col] (and since col is 0 on the first time through the loop, this is
ciphertext[0]).

Figure 8-2. Arrows pointing to what message[pointer] refers to during the first iteration of
the for loop when col is set to 0.
Figure 8-2 shows the characters at these indexes, they will be concatenated together to form the
string 'Ceno'. Remember that we want the value in ciphertext to eventually look like this:
>>> ciphertext = ['Ceno', 'onom', 'mstm', 'me o', 'o sn', 'nio.', ' s ', 's c']
>>> ciphertext[0]
'Ceno'
>>>

Storing 'Ceno' as the first string in the ciphertext list is our first step.
On the next iteration of the for loop, col will be set to 1 (instead of 0) and pointer will start
at the same value as col. Now when we add 8 to pointer on each iteration of line 30’s
while loop, the indexes will be 1, 9, 17, and 25.

Figure 8-3. Arrows pointing to to what message[pointer] refers to during the second
iteration of the for loop when col is set to 1.
As message[1], message[9], message[17], and message[25] are concatenated to the
end of ciphertext[1], they form the string 'onom'. This is the second column of our grid.

118

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Once the for loop has finished looping for the rest of the columns, the value in ciphertext
will be ['Ceno', 'onom', 'mstm', 'me o', 'o sn', 'nio.', ' s ', 's c'].
We will use the join() string method to convert this list of strings into a single string.

The join() String Method
The join() method is used later on line 39. The join() method takes a list of strings and
returns a single string. This single string has all of the strings in the list concatenated (that is,
joined) together. The string that the join() method gets called on will be placed in between the
strings in the list. (Most of the time, we will just use a blank string for this.) Try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>> eggs = ['dogs', 'cats', 'moose']
>>> ''.join(eggs)
'dogscatsmoose'
>>> ' '.join(eggs)
'dogs cats moose'
>>> 'XYZ'.join(eggs)
'dogsXYZcatsXYZmoose'
>>> ''.join(eggs).upper().join(eggs)
'dogsDOGSCATSMOOSEcatsDOGSCATSMOOSEmoose'
>>>

That last expression, ''.join(eggs).upper().join(eggs), looks a little tricky, but if
you go through the evaluation one step at a time, it will look like this:

Figure 8-4. The steps of evaluation for ''.join(eggs).upper().join(eggs)

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 8 – The Transposition Cipher, Encrypting

119

This is why ''.join(eggs).upper().join(eggs) returns the string,
'dogsDOGSCATSMOOSEcatsDOGSCATSMOOSEmoose'.
Whew!
Remember, no matter how complicated an expression looks, you can just evaluate it step by step
to get the single value the expression evaluates to.

Return Values and return Statements
transpositionEncrypt.py

38.
39.

# Convert the ciphertext list into a single string value and return it.
return ''.join(ciphertext)

Our use of the join() method isn’t nearly as complicated as the previous example. We just
want to call join() on the blank string and pass ciphertext as the argument so that the
strings in the ciphertext list are joined together (with nothing in between them).
Remember that a function (or method) call always evaluates to a value. We say that this is the
value returned by the function or method call, or that it is the return value of the function. When
we create our own functions with a def statement, we use a return statement to tell what the
return value for our function is.
A return statement is the return keyword followed by the value to be returned. We can also
use an expression instead of a value. In that case the return value will be whatever value that
expression evaluates to. Open a new file editor window and type the following program in and
save it as addNumbers.py, then press F5 to run it:

Source code for addNumbers.py
1. def addNumbers(a, b):
2.
return a + b
3.
4. spam = addNumbers(2, 40)
5. print(spam)

When you run this program, the output will be:
42

That’s because the function call addNumbers(2, 40) will evaluate to 42. The return
statement in addNumbers() will evaluate the expression a + b and then return the evaluated

120

value. That is why addNumbers(2, 40) evaluates to 42, which is the value stored in spam
on line 4 and next printed to the screen on line 5.

# Convert the ciphertext list into a single string value and return it.
return ''.join(ciphertext)

The encryptMessage() function’s return statement returns a string value that is created
by joining all of the strings in the ciphertext list. This final string is the result of our
encryption code.
The great thing about functions is that a programmer only has to know what the function does,
but not how the function’s code does it. A programmer can understand that if she calls the
encryptMessage() function and pass it an integer and a string for the key and message
parameters, the function call will evaluate to an encrypted string. She doesn’t need to know
anything about how the code in encryptMessage() actually does this.

The Special __name__ Variable
transpositionEncrypt.py

42. # If transpositionEncrypt.py is run (instead of imported as a module) call
43. # the main() function.
44. if __name__ == '__main__':
45.
main()

We can turn our transposition encryption program into a module with a special trick involving the
main() function and a variable named __name__.
When a Python program is run, there is a special variable with the name __name__ (that’s two
underscores before “name” and two underscores after) that is assigned the string value
'__main__' (again, two underscores before and after “main”) even before the first line of your
program is run.
At the end of our script file (and, more importantly, after all of our def statements), we want to
have some code that checks if the __name__ variable has the '__main__' string assigned to
it. If so, we want to call the main() function.

121

This if statement on line 44 ends up actually being one of the first lines of code executed when
we press F5 to run our transposition cipher encryption program (after the import statement on
line 4 and the def statements on lines 6 and 21).
The reason we set up our code this way is although Python sets __name__ to '__main__'
when the program is run, it sets it to the string 'transpositionEncrypt' if our program is
imported by a different Python program. This is how our program can know if it is being run as a
program or imported by a different program as a module.
Just like how our program imports the pyperclip module to call the functions in it, other
programs might want to import transpositionEncrypt.py to call its encryptMessage()
function. When an import statement is executed, Python will look for a file for the module by
adding “.py” to the end of the name. (This is why import pyperclip will import the
pyperclip.py file.)
When a Python program is imported, the __name__ variable is set to the filename part before
“.py” and then runs the program. When our transpositionEncrypt.py program is imported, we
want all the def statements to be run (to define the encryptMessage() function that the
importing program wants to use), but we don’t want it to call the main() function because that
will execute the encryption code for 'Common sense is not so common.' with key 8.
That is why we put that part of the code inside a function (which by convention is named
main()) and then add code at the end of the program to call main(). If we do this, then our
program can both be run as a program on its own and also imported as a module by
another program.

Key Size and Message Length
Notice what happens when the message length is less than twice the key size:
C o m m o
m m o n .

n (s) s

e n s

e

(s) i

s

(s) n o t

(s) s

o (s) c

o

When using a key of 25, the “Common sense is not so common.” message encrypts to
“Cmommomno.n sense is not so co”. Part of the message isn’t encrypted! This happens whenever
key size becomes more than twice the message length, because that causes there to only be one
character per column and no characters get scrambled for that part of the message.
Because of this, the transposition cipher’s key is limited to half the length of the message it is
used to encrypt. The longer a message is, the more possible keys that can be used to encrypt it.

122

Summary
Whew! There were a lot of new programming concepts introduced in this chapter. The
transposition cipher program is much more complicated (but much more secure) than the Caesar
cipher program in the last chapter. The new concepts, functions, data types, and operators we’ve
learned in this chapter let us manipulate data in much more sophisticated ways. Just remember
that much of understanding a line of code is just evaluating it step by step the way Python will.
We can organize our code into groups called functions, which we create with def statements.
Argument values can be passed to functions for the function’s parameters. Parameters are local
variables. Variables outside of all functions are global variables. Local variables are different
from global variables, even if they have the same name as the global variable.
List values can store multiple other values, including other list values. Many of the things you can
do with strings (such as indexing, slicing, and the len() function) can be used on lists. And
augmented assignment operators provide a nice shortcut to regular assignment operators. The
join() method can join a list that contains multiple strings to return a single string.
Feel free to go over this chapter again if you are not comfortable with these programming
concepts. In the next chapter, we will cover decrypting with the transposition cipher.

Unlike the Caesar cipher, the decryption process for the transposition cipher is very different
from the encryption process. In this chapter we will create a separate program,
transpositionDecrypt.py, to handle decryption.

Decrypting with the Transposition Cipher on Paper
Let’s pretend we send the ciphertext “Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c” to a friend (and she
already knows that the secret key is 8). The first step for her to decrypt the ciphertext is to
calculate how many boxes she needs to draw. To find this amount, divide the length of the
ciphertext message by the key and round up. The length of our ciphertext is 30 characters (exactly
the same as the plaintext) and the key is 8. So calculate 30 divided by 8 to get 3.75.
3.75 rounds up to 4. This means we want to draw a grid of boxes with 4 columns (the number we
just calculated) and 8 rows (the key). It will look like this:

(Note that if the length divided by the key was a whole number, like in 30 / 5 = 6.0, then 6.0
would not “round up” to 7.)
The second thing we need to calculate is how many boxes on the rightmost column to shade in.
Take the total number of boxes (32) and subtract the length of the ciphertext (30). 32 – 30 = 2, so
shade in the bottom 2 boxes on the rightmost column:

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 9 – The Transposition Cipher, Decrypting

125

Then start filling in the boxes with one character of the ciphertext per box. Start at the top left and
go right, just like we did when we were encrypting. The ciphertext is “Cenoonommstmme oo
snnio. s s c”, and so “Ceno” goes in the first row, then “onom” in the second row, and so on.
After we are done, the boxes will look like this (where the (s) represents a space):
C e
n o
o
n
o m
m s
t m
m e (s) o
o (s) s n
n
i
o
.
(s) s (s)
s (s) c

Our friend who received the ciphertext will see that if she reads the text going down the columns,
the original plaintext has been restored: “Common sense is not so common.”
The steps for decrypting are:
1. Calculate the number of columns you will have by taking the length of the message and
dividing by the key, then rounding up.
2. Draw out a number of boxes. The number of columns was calculated in step 1. The
number of rows is the same as the key.
3. Calculate the number of boxes to shade in by taking the number of boxes (this is the
number of rows and columns multiplied) and subtracting the length of the ciphertext
message.
4. Shade in the number of boxes you calculated in step 3 at the bottom of the rightmost
column.
5. Fill in the characters of the ciphertext starting at the top row and going from left to right.
Skip any of the shaded boxes.
6. Get the plaintext by reading from the leftmost column going from top to bottom, and
moving over to the top of the next column.
Note that if you use a different key, you will be drawing out the wrong number of rows. Even if
you follow the other steps in the decryption process correctly, the plaintext will come out looking
like random garbage (just like when you use the wrong key with the Caesar cipher).

The first part of the program is very similar to the first part of transpositionEncrypt.py. The
pyperclip module is imported along with a different module named math. If you separate the
module names with commas, you can import multiple modules with one import statement.
The main() function creates variables named myMessage and myKey, and then calls the
decryption function decryptMessage(). The return value of this function is the decrypted
plaintext of the ciphertext and key that we passed it. This is stored in a variable named
plaintext, which is then printed to the screen (with a pipe character at the end in case there
are spaces at the end of the message) and copied to the clipboard.

“Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c” (which has 30 characters) with the key 8, then the final set of
boxes will look like this:
C e
n o
o
n
o m
m s
t m
m e (s) o
o (s) s n
n
i
o
.
(s) s (s)
s (s) c
The decryptMessage() function implements each of the decryption steps as Python code.

The math.ceil(), math.floor() and round() Functions
When you divide numbers using the / operator, the expression returns a floating point number
(that is, a number with a decimal point). This happens even if the number divides evenly. For
example, 21 / 7 will evaluate to 3.0, not 3.

129

>>> 21 / 7
3.0
>>>

This is useful because if a number does not divide evenly, the numbers after the decimal point
will be needed. For example, 22 / 5 evaluates to 4.4:
>>> 22 / 5
4.4
>>>

(If the expression 22 / 5 evaluates to 4 instead of 4.4, then you are using version 2 of Python
instead of version 3. Please go to the http://python.org website and download and install Python
3.)
If you want to round this number to the nearest integer, you can use the round() function. Type
the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
4
>>>
4
>>>
5
>>>
5
>>>
4
>>>

round(4.2)
round(4.5)
round(4.9)
round(5.0)
round(22 / 5)

If you only want to round up then use the math.ceil() function, which stands for “ceiling”. If
you only want to round down then use the math.floor() function. These functions exist in
the math module, so you will need to import the math module before calling them. Type the
following into the interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
4
>>>
4
>>>
4
>>>

import math
math.floor(4.0)
math.floor(4.2)
math.floor(4.9)
math.ceil(4.0)

130

4
>>> math.ceil(4.2)
5
>>> math.ceil(4.9)
5
>>>

The math.ceil() function will implement step 1 of the transposition decryption.

# The transposition decrypt function will simulate the "columns" and

numOfRows = key
28.
# The number of "shaded boxes" in the last "column" of the grid:
29.
numOfShadedBoxes = (numOfColumns * numOfRows) - len(message)

Line 25 calculates the number of columns (step 1 of decrypting) by dividing len(message) by
the integer in key. This value is passed to the math.ceil() function, and that return value is
stored in numOfColumns.
Line 27 calculates the number of rows (step 2 of decrypting), which is the integer stored in key.
This value gets stored in the variable numOfRows.
Line 29 calculates the number of shaded boxes in the grid (step 3 of decrypting), which will be
the number of columns times rows, minus the length of the message.
If we are decrypting “Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c” with key 8, numOfColumns will be
set to 4, numOfRows will be set to 8, and numOfShadedBoxes will be set to 2.

# Each string in plaintext represents a column in the grid.
plaintext = [''] * numOfColumns

Just like the encryption program had a variable named ciphertext that was a list of strings to
represent the grid of ciphertext, the decryptMessage() function will have a variable named
plaintext that is a list of strings. These strings start off as blank strings, and we will need one

string for each column of the grid. Using list replication, we can multiply a list of one blank string
by numOfColumns to make a list of several blank strings.
(Remember that each function call has its own local scope. The plaintext in
decryptMessage() exists in a different local scope than the plaintext variable in
main(), so they are two different variables that just happen to have the same name.)
Remember that the grid for our 'Cenoonommstmme oo snnio. s s c' example looks
like this:
C e
n o
o
n
o m
m s
t m
m e (s) o
o (s) s n
n
i
o
.
(s) s (s)
s (s) c
The plaintext variable will have a list of strings. Each string in the list is a single column of
this grid. For this decryption, we want plaintext to end up with this value:
>>> plaintext = ['Common s', 'ense is ', 'not so c', 'ommon.']
>>> plaintext[0]
'Common s'

That way, we can join all the list’s strings together to get the 'Common sense is not so
common.' string value to return.

# The col and row variables point to where in the grid the next

col = 0
row = 0
for symbol in message:

The col and row variables will track the column and row where the next character in message
should go. We will start these variables at 0. Line 39 will start a for loop that iterates over the
characters in the message string. Inside this loop the code will adjust the col and row
variables so that we concatenate symbol to the correct string in the plaintext list.

plaintext[col] += symbol
col += 1 # point to next column

As the first step in this loop we concatenate symbol to the string at index col in the
plaintext list. Then we add 1 to col (that is, we increment col) on line 41 so that on the
next iteration of the loop, symbol will be concatenated to the next string.

The and and or Boolean Operators
The Boolean operators and and or can help us form more complicated conditions for if and
while statements. The and operator connects two expressions and evaluates to True if both
expressions evaluate to True. The or operator connects two expressions and evaluates to True
if one or both expressions evaluate to True. Otherwise these expressions evaluate to False.
Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 10 > 5 and 2 < 4
True
>>> 10 > 5 and 4 != 4
False
>>>

The first expression above evaluates to True because the two expressions on the sides of the
and operator both evaluate to True. This means that the expression 10 > 5 and 2 < 4
evaluates to True and True, which in turn evaluates to True.
However, for the second above expression, although 10 > 5 evaluates to True the expression
4 != 4 evaluates to False. This means the whole expression evaluates to True and
False. Since both expressions have to be True for the and operator to evaluate to True,
instead they evaluate to False.
Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 10 > 5 or 4 != 4
True
>>> 10 < 5 or 4 != 4
False
>>>

For the or operator, only one of the sides must be True for the or operator to evaluate them
both to True. This is why 10 > 5 or 4 != 4 evaluates to True. However, because both

Chapter 9 – The Transposition Cipher, Decrypting

133

the expression 10 < 5 and the expression 4 != 4 are both False, this makes the second
above expression evaluate to False or False, which in turn evaluates to False.
The third Boolean operator is not. The not operator evaluates to the opposite Boolean value of
the value it operates on. So not True is False and not False is True. Type the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> not
False
>>> not
True
>>> not
True
>>> not
False
>>> not
True
>>>

10 > 5
10 < 5
False
not False
not not not not False

Truth Tables
If you ever forget how the Boolean operators work, you can look at these charts, which are called
truth tables:

The and and or Operators are Shortcuts
Just like for loops let us do the same thing as while loops but with less code, the and and or
operators let us shorten our code also. Type in the following into the interactive shell. Both of
these bits of code do the same thing:
>>> if 10 > 5:
...
if 2 < 4:
...
print('Hello!')
...
Hello!
>>>
>>> if 10 > 5 and 2 < 4:
...
print('Hello!')
...
Hello!
>>>

So you can see that the and operator basically takes the place of two if statements (where the
second if statement is inside the first if statement’s block.)
You can also replace the or operator with an if and elif statement, though you will have to
copy the code twice. Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> if 4 != 4:
...
print('Hello!')
... elif 10 > 5:
...
print('Hello!')
...
Hello!
>>>
>>> if 4 != 4 or 10 > 5:
...
print('Hello!')
...
Hello!
>>>

Order of Operations for Boolean Operators
Just like the math operators have an order of operations, the and, or, and not operators also
have an order of operations: first not, then and, and then or. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> not False and True
True
>>> not (False and True)
False
>>>

# not False evaluates first
# (False and True) evaluates first

# If there are no more columns OR we're at a shaded box, go back to
# the first column and the next row.
if (col == numOfColumns) or (col == numOfColumns - 1 and row >=
numOfShadedBoxes):
col = 0
row += 1

There are two cases where we want to reset col back to 0 (so that on the next iteration of the
loop, symbol is added to the first string in the list in plaintext). The first is if we have
incremented col past the last index in plaintext. In this case, the value in col will be equal
to numOfColumns. (Remember that the last index in plaintext will be numOfColumns
minus one. So when col is equal to numOfColumns, it is already past the last index.)
The second case is if both col is at the last index and the row variable is pointing to a row that
has a shaded box in the last column. Here’s the complete decryption grid with the column indexes
along the top and the row indexes down the side:

You can see that the shaded boxes are in the last column (whose index will be numOfColumns
- 1) and rows 6 and 7. To have our program calculate which row indexes are shaded, we use the
expression row >= numOfRows - numOfShadedBoxes. If this expression is True, and
col is equal to numOfColumns - 1, then we know that we want to reset col to 0 for the
next iteration.
These two cases are why the condition on line 45 is (col == numOfColumns) or (col
== numOfColumns - 1 and row >= numOfRows - numOfShadedBoxes). That
looks like a big, complicated expression but remember that you can break it down into smaller
parts. The block of code that executes will change col back to the first column by setting it to 0.
We will also increment the row variable.

return ''.join(plaintext)

By the time the for loop on line 39 has finished looping over every character in message, the
plaintext list’s strings have been modified so that they are now in the decrypted order (if the
correct key was used, that is). The strings in the plaintext list are joined together (with a
blank string in between each string) by the join() string method. The string that this call to
join() returns will be the value that our decryptMessage() function returns.

For our example decryption, plaintext will be ['Common s', 'ense is ', 'not so
c', 'ommon.'], so ''.join(plaintext) will evaluate to 'Common sense is not
so common.'.

The first line that our program runs after importing modules and executing the def statements is
the if statement on line 54. Just like in the transposition encryption program, we check if this
program has been run (instead of imported by a different program) by checking if the special
__name__ variable is set to the string value '__main__'. If so, we execute the main()
function.

Summary
That’s it for the decryption program. Most of the program is in the decryptMessage()
function. We can see that our programs can encrypt and decrypt the message “Common sense is
not so common.” with the key 8. But we should try several other messages and keys to see that a
message that is encrypted and then decrypted will result in the same thing as the original
message. Otherwise, we know that either the encryption code or the decryption code doesn’t
work.
We could start changing the key and message variables in our transpositionEncrypt.py and
transpositionDecrypt.py and then running them to see if it works. But instead, let’s automate this
by writing a program to test our program.

“It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that

Bruce Schneier, cryptographer

We can try out the transposition encryption and decryption programs from the previous chapter
by encrypting and decrypting a few messages with different keys. It seems to work pretty well.
But does it always work?

You won’t know unless you test the encryptMessage() and decryptMessage()
functions with different values for the message and key parameters. This would take a lot of
time. You’ll have to type out a message in the encryption program, set the key, run the encryption
program, paste the ciphertext into the decryption program, set the key, and then run the
decryption program. And you’ll want to repeat that with several different keys and messages!
That’s a lot of boring work. Instead we can write a program to test the cipher programs for us.
This new program can generate a random message and a random key. It will then encrypt the
message with the encryptMessage() function from transpositionEncrypt.py and then pass
the ciphertext from that to the decryptMessage() in transpositionDecrypt.py. If the plaintext
returned by decryptMessage() is the same as the original message, the program can know
that the encryption and decryption messages work. This is called automated testing.
There are several different message and key combinations to try, but it will only take the
computer a minute or so to test thousands different combinations. If all of those tests pass, then
we can be much more certain that our code works.

Transposition cipher test passed.

Our testing program works by importing the transpositionEncrypt.py and transpositionDecrypt.py
programs as modules. This way, we can call the encryptMessage() and
decryptMessage() functions in these programs. Our testing program will create a random
message and choose a random key. It doesn’t matter that the message is just random letters, we
just need to check that encrypting and then decrypting the message will result in the original
message.
Our program will repeat this test twenty times by putting this code in a loop. If at any point the
returned string from transpositionDecrypt() is not the exact same as the original
message, our program will print an error message and exit.

# Transposition Cipher Test

import random, sys, transpositionEncrypt, transpositionDecrypt
def main():

First our program imports two modules that come with Python, random and sys. We also want
to import the transposition cipher programs we’ve written: transpositionEncrypt.py and
transpositionDecrypt.py. Note that we don’t put the .py extension in our import statement.

Pseudorandom Numbers and the random.seed() Function
transpositionTest.py

7.

random.seed(42) # set the random "seed" to a static value

Technically, the numbers produced by Python’s random.randint() function are not really
random. They are produced from a pseudorandom number generator algorithm, and this
algorithm is well known and the numbers it produces are predictable. We call these randomlooking (but predictable) numbers pseudorandom numbers because they are not truly random.

142

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The pseudorandom number generator algorithm starts with an initial number called the seed. All
of the random numbers produced from a seed are predictable. You can reset Python’s random
seed by calling the random.seed() function. Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
>>>
...
...
7
1
3
3
8
>>>
>>>
...
...

import random
random.seed(42)
for i in range(5):
print(random.randint(1, 10))

random.seed(42)
for i in range(5):
print(random.randint(1, 10))

When the seed for Python’s pseudorandom number generator is set to 42, the first “random”
number between 1 and 10 will always be 7. The second “random” number will always be 1, and
the third number will always be 3, and so on. When we reset the seed back to 42 again, the same
set of pseudorandom numbers will be returned from random.randint().
Setting the random seed by calling random.seed() will be useful for our testing program,
because we want predictable numbers so that the same pseudorandom messages and keys are
chosen each time we run the automated testing program. Our Python programs only seem to
generate “unpredictable” random numbers because the seed is set to the computer’s current clock
time (specifically, the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970) when the random module is
first imported.
It is important to note that not using truly random numbers is a common security flaw of
encryption software. If the “random” numbers in your programs can be predicted, then this can
provide a cryptanalyst with a useful hint to breaking your cipher. More information about
generating truly random numbers with Python using the os.urandom() function can be found
at http://invpy.com/random.

for i in range(20): # run 20 tests
# Generate random messages to test.
# The message will have a random length:
message = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' * random.randint(4, 40)

The code that does a single test will be in this for loop’s block. We want this program to run
multiple tests since the more tests we try, the more certain that we know our programs work.

Line 13 creates a random message from the uppercase letters and stores it in the message
variable. Line 13 uses string replication to create messages of different lengths. The
random.randint() function takes two integer arguments and returns a random integer
between those two integers (including the integers themselves). Type the following into the
interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
20
>>>
18
>>>
3
>>>
18
>>>
107
>>>

import random
random.randint(1, 20)
random.randint(1, 20)
random.randint(1, 20)
random.randint(1, 20)
random.randint(100, 200)

Of course, since these are pseudorandom numbers, the numbers you get will probably be different
than the ones above. Line 13 creates a random message from the uppercase letters and stores it in
the message variable. Line 13 uses string replication to create messages of different lengths.

References
Technically, variables do not store list values in them. Instead, they store reference values to list
values. Up until now the difference hasn’t been important. But storing list references instead of
lists becomes important if you copy a variable with a list reference to another variable. Try
entering the following into the shell:

144

>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
100
>>>
42
>>>

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

spam = 42
cheese = spam
spam = 100
spam
cheese

This makes sense from what we know so far. We assign 42 to the spam variable, and then we
copy the value in spam and assign it to the variable cheese. When we later change the value in
spam to 100, this doesn’t affect the value in cheese. This is because spam and cheese are
different variables that each store their own values.
But lists don’t work this way. When you assign a list to a variable with the = sign, you are
actually assigning a list reference to the variable. A reference is a value that points to some bit
of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a list. Here is some code that will make this
easier to understand. Type this into the shell:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
[0,
>>>
[0,

spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese = spam
cheese[1] = 'Hello!'
spam
'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese
'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]

This looks odd. The code only changed the cheese list, but it seems that both the cheese and
spam lists have changed.
Notice that the line cheese = spam copies the list reference in spam to cheese, instead of
copying the list value itself. This is because the value stored in the spam variable is a list
reference, and not the list value itself. This means that the values stored in both spam and
cheese refer to the same list. There is only one list because the list was not copied, the reference
to the list was copied. So when you modify cheese in the cheese[1] = 'Hello!' line,
you are modifying the same list that spam refers to. This is why spam seems to have the same
list value that cheese does.

Remember that variables are like boxes that contain values. List variables don’t actually contain
lists at all, they contain references to lists. Here are some pictures that explain what happens in
the code you just typed in:

Figure 10-1. Variables do not store lists, but rather references to lists.
On the first line, the actual list is not contained in the spam variable but a reference to the list.
The list itself is not stored in any variable.

Figure 10-2. Two variables store two references to the same list.

146

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

When you assign the reference in spam to cheese, the cheese variable contains a copy of the
reference in spam. Now both cheese and spam refer to the same list.

Figure 10-3. Changing the list changes all variables with references to that list.
When you alter the list that cheese refers to, the list that spam refers to is also changed because
they refer to the same list. If you want spam and cheese to store two different lists, you have to
create two different lists instead of copying a reference:
>>> spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

In the above example, spam and cheese have two different lists stored in them (even though
these lists are identical in content). Now if you modify one of the lists, it will not affect the other
because spam and cheese have references to two different lists:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
[0,
>>>
[0,

spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese[1] = 'Hello!'
spam
1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese
'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]

Figure 10-4 shows how the two references point to two different lists:

Figure 10-4. Two variables each storing references to two different lists.

The copy.deepcopy() Functions
As we saw in the previous example, the following code only copies the reference value, not the
list value itself:
>>> spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese = spam
# copies the reference, not the list

If we want to copy the list value itself, we can import the copy module to call the
copy.deepcopy() function, which will return a separate copy of the list it is passed:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
[0,
>>>
[0,
>>>

spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
import copy
cheese = copy.deepcopy(spam)
cheese[1] = 'Hello!'
spam
1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese
'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]

148

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The copy.deepcopy() function isn’t used in this chapter’s program, but it is helpful when
you need to make a duplicate list value to store in a different variable.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 10, Set A
Practice exercises can be found at http://invpy.com/hackingpractice10A.

The random.shuffle() Function
The random.shuffle() function is also in the random module. It accepts a list argument,
and then randomly rearranges items in the list. Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
>>>
[0,
>>>
>>>
[3,
>>>
>>>
[1,
>>>

import random
spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
spam
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
random.shuffle(spam)
spam
0, 5, 9, 6, 8, 2, 4, 1, 7]
random.shuffle(spam)
spam
2, 5, 9, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 8]

An important thing to note is that shuffle() does not return a list value. Instead, it changes
the list value that is passed to it (because shuffle() modifies the list directly from the list
reference value it is passed.) We say that the shuffle() function modifies the list in-place.
This is why we only need to execute random.shuffle(spam) instead of spam =
random.shuffle(spam).
Remember that you can use the list() function to convert a string or range object to a list
value. Type the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import random
>>> eggs = list('Hello')
>>> eggs
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
>>> random.shuffle(eggs)
>>> eggs
['o', 'H', 'l', 'l', 'e']
>>>

149

And also remember you can use the join() string method to pass a list of strings and return a
single string:
>>> eggs
['o', 'H', 'l', 'l', 'e']
>>> eggs = ''.join(eggs)
>>> eggs
'oHlle'
>>>

Randomly Scrambling a String
transpositionTest.py

16.

18.

# Convert the message string to a list to shuffle it.
message = list(message)
random.shuffle(message)
message = ''.join(message) # convert list to string

In order to shuffle the characters in a string value, first we convert the string to a list with
list(), then shuffle the items in the list with shuffle(), and then convert back to string
value with the join() string method. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
'wl
>>>

import random
spam = 'Hello world!'
spam = list(spam)
random.shuffle(spam)
spam = ''.join(spam)
spam
delHo!orl'

We use this technique to scramble the letters in the message variable. This way we can test
many different messages just in case our transposition cipher can encrypt and decrypt some
messages but not others.

Back to the Code
transpositionTest.py

20.

print('Test #%s: "%s..."' % (i+1, message[:50]))

Line 20 has a print() call that displays which test number we are on (we add one to i because
i starts at 0 and we want the test numbers to start at 1). Since the string in message can be very
long, we use string slicing to show only the first 50 characters of message.

150

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Line 20 uses string interpolation. The value that i+1 evaluates to will replace the first %s in the
string and the value that message[:50] evaluates to will replace the second %s. When using
string interpolation, be sure the number of %s in the string matches the number of values that are
in between the parentheses after it.
transpositionTest.py

22.
23.

# Check all possible keys for each message.
for key in range(1, len(message)):

While the key for the Caesar cipher could be an integer from 0 to 25, the key for the
transposition cipher can be between 1 and the length of the message. We want to test every
possible key for the test message, so the for loop on line 23 will run the test code with the keys
1 up to (but not including) the length of the message.
transpositionTest.py

24.
25.

encrypted = transpositionEncrypt.encryptMessage(key, message)
decrypted = transpositionDecrypt.decryptMessage(key, encrypted)

Line 24 encrypts the string in message using our encryptMessage() function. Since this
function is inside the transpositionEncrypt.py file, we need to add transpositionEncrypt.
(with the period at the end) to the front of the function name.
The encrypted string that is returned from encryptMessage() is then passed to
decryptMessage(). We use the same key for both function calls. The return value from
decryptMessage() is stored in a variable named decrypted. If the functions worked, then
the string in message should be the exact same as the string in decrypted.

The sys.exit() Function
transpositionTest.py

27.
# If the decryption doesn't match the original message, display
28.
# an error message and quit.
29.
if message != decrypted:
30.
print('Mismatch with key %s and message %s.' % (key,
message))
31.
print(decrypted)
32.
sys.exit()
33.
34.
print('Transposition cipher test passed.')

Line 29 tests if message and decrypted are equal. If they aren’t, we want to display an error
message on the screen. We print the key, message, and decrypted values. This information
could help us figure out what happened. Then we will exit the program.
Normally our programs exit once the execution reaches the very bottom and there are no more
lines to execute. However, we can make the program exit sooner than that by calling the
sys.exit() function. When sys.exit() is called, the program will immediately end.
But if the values in message and decrypted are equal to each other, the program execution
skips the if statement’s block and the call to sys.exit(). The next line is on line 34, but you
can see from its indentation that it is the first line after line 9’s for loop.
This means that after line 29’s if statement’s block, the program execution will jump back to
line 23’s for loop for the next iteration of that loop. If it has finished looping, then instead the
execution jumps back to line 9’s for loop for the next iteration of that loop. And if it has
finished looping for that loop, then it continues on to line 34 to print out the string
'Transposition cipher test passed.'.
transpositionTest.py

37. # If transpositionTest.py is run (instead of imported as a module) call
38. # the main() function.
39. if __name__ == '__main__':
40.
main()

Here we do the trick of checking if the special variable __name__ is set to '__main__' and if
so, calling the main() function. This way, if another program imports transpositionTest.py, the
code inside main() will not be executed but the def statements that create the main()
function will be.

Testing Our Test Program
We’ve written a test program that tests our encryption programs, but how do we know that the
test program works? What if there is a bug with our test program, and it is just saying that our
transposition cipher programs work when they really don’t?
We can test our test program by purposefully adding bugs to our encryption or decryption
functions. Then when we run the test program, if it does not detect a problem with our cipher
program, then we know that the test program is not correctly testing our cipher programs.
Change transpositionEncrypt.py’s line 36 from this:

Summary
We can use our programming skills for more than just writing programs. We can also program
the computer to test those programs to make sure they work for different inputs. It is a common
practice to write code to test code.
This chapter covered a few new functions such as the random.randint() function for
producing pseudorandom numbers. Remember, pseudorandom numbers aren’t random enough
for cryptography programs, but they are good enough for this chapter’s testing program. The
random.shuffle() function is useful for scrambling the order of items in a list value.
The copy.deepcopy() function will create copies of list values instead of reference values.
The difference between a list and list reference is explained in this chapter as well.
All of our programs so far have only encrypted short messages. In the next chapter, we will learn
how to encrypt and decrypt entire files on your hard drive.

Up until now our programs have only worked on small messages that we type directly into the
source code as string values. The cipher program in this chapter will use the transposition cipher
to encrypt and decrypt entire files, which can be millions of characters in size.

Plain Text Files
This program will encrypt and decrypt plain text files. These are the kind of files that only have
text data and usually have the .txt file extension. Files from word processing programs that let
you change the font, color, or size of the text do not produce plain text files. You can write your
own text files using Notepad (on Windows), TextMate or TextEdit (on OS X), or gedit (on Linux)
or a similar plain text editor program. You can even use IDLE’s own file editor and save the files
with a .txt extension instead of the usual .py extension.
For some samples, you can download the following text files from this book’s website:





http://invpy.com/devilsdictionary.txt
http://invpy.com/frankenstein.txt
http://invpy.com/siddhartha.txt
http://invpy.com/thetimemachine.txt

These are text files of some books (that are now in the public domain, so it is perfectly legal to
download them.) For example, download Mary Shelley’s classic novel “Frankenstein” from
http://invpy.com/frankenstein.txt. Double-click the file to open it in a text editor program. There
are over 78,000 words in this text file! It would take some time to type this into our encryption
program. But if it is in a file, the program can read the file and do the encryption in a couple
seconds.
If you get an error that looks like “UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't
decode byte 0x90 in position 148: character maps to <undefined>”
then you are running the cipher program on a non-plain text file, also called a “binary file”.
To find other public domain texts to download, go to the Project Gutenberg website at
http://www.gutenberg.org/.

Source Code of the Transposition File Cipher Program
Like our transposition cipher testing program, the transposition cipher file program will import
our transpositionEncrypt.py and transpositionDecrypt.py files so we can use the

encryptMessage() and decryptMessage() functions in them. This way we don’t have
to re-type the code for these functions in our new program.
Open a new file editor window by clicking on File ► New Window. Type in the following code
into the file editor, and then save it as transpositionFileCipher.py. Press F5 to run the program.
Note that first you will need to download frankenstein.txt and place this file in the same directory
as the transpositionFileCipher.py file. You can download this file from
http://invpy.com/frankenstein.txt.

Sample Run of the Transposition File Cipher Program
When you run the above program, it produces this output:
Encrypting...
Encryption time: 1.21 seconds
Done encrypting frankenstein.txt (441034 characters).
Encrypted file is frankenstein.encrypted.txt.

A new frankenstein.encrypted.txt file will have been created in the same directory as
transpositionFileCipher.py. If you open this file with IDLE’s file editor, you will see the
encrypted contents of frankenstein.py. You can now email this encrypted file to someone for them
to decrypt.

Reading From Files
Up until now, any input we want to give our programs would have to be typed in by the user.
Python programs can open and read files directly off of the hard drive. There are three steps to
reading the contents of a file: opening the file, reading into a variable, and then closing the file.

The open() Function and File Objects
The open() function’s first parameter is a string for the name of the file to open. If the file is in
the same directory as the Python program then you can just type in the name, such as
'thetimemachine.txt'. You can always specify the absolute path of the file, which
includes the directory that it is in. For example, 'c:\\Python32\\frankenstein.txt'
(on Windows) and '/usr/foobar/frankenstein.txt' (on OS X and Linux) are
absolute filenames. (Remember that the \ backslash must be escaped with another backslash
before it.)
The open() function returns a value of the “file object” data type. This value has several
methods for reading from, writing to, and closing the file.

The read() File Object Method
The read() method will return a string containing all the text in the file. For example, say the
file spam.txt contained the text “Hello world!”. (You can create this file yourself using IDLE’s
file editor. Just save the file with a .txt extension.) Run the following from the interactive shell
(this codes assumes you are running Windows and the spam.txt file is in the c:\ directory):
>>> fo = open('c:\\spam.txt', 'r')
>>> content = fo.read()
>>> print(content)

158

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Hello world!
>>>

If your text file has multiple lines, the string returned by read() will have \n newline
characters in it at the end of each line. When you try to print a string with newline characters, the
string will print across several lines:
>>> print('Hello\nworld!')
Hello
world!
>>>

If you get an error message that says “IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or
directory” then double check that you typed the filename (and if it is an absolute path, the
directory name) correctly. Also make sure that the file actually is where you think it is.

The close() File Object Method
After you have read the file’s contents into a variable, you can tell Python that you are done with
the file by calling the close() method on the file object.
>>> fo.close()
>>>

Python will automatically close any open files when the program terminates. But when you want
to re-read the contents of a file, you must close the file object and then call the open() function
on the file again.
Here’s the code in our transposition cipher program that reads the file whose filename is stored in
the inputFilename variable:
transpositionFileCipher.py

26.
27.
28.
29.

# Read in the message from the input file
fileObj = open(inputFilename)
content = fileObj.read()
fileObj.close()

Writing To Files
We read the original file and now will write the encrypted (or decrypted) form to a different file.
The file object returned by open() has a write() function, although you can only use this

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 11 – Encrypting and Decrypting Files

159

function if you open the file in “write” mode instead of “read” mode. You do this by passing the
string value 'w' as the second parameter. For example:
>>> fo = open('filename.txt', 'w')
>>>

Along with “read” and “write”, there is also an “append” mode. The “append” is like “write”
mode, except any strings written to the file will be appended to the end of any content that is
already in the file. “Append” mode will not overwrite the file if it already exists. To open a file in
append mode, pass the string 'a' as the second argument to open().
(Just in case you were curious, you could pass the string 'r' to open() to open the file in read
mode. But since passing no second argument at all also opens the file in read mode, there’s no
reason to pass 'r'.)

The write() File Object Method
You can write text to a file by calling the file object’s write() method. The file object must
have been opened in write mode, otherwise, you will get a “io.UnsupportedOperation:
not readable” error message. (And if you try to call read() on a file object that was
opened in write mode, you will get a “io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable”
error message.)
The write() method takes one argument: a string of text that is to be written to the file. Lines
43 to 45 open a file in write mode, write to the file, and then close the file object.
transpositionFileCipher.py

42.
43.
44.
45.

# Write out the translated message to the output file.
outputFileObj = open(outputFilename, 'w')
outputFileObj.write(translated)
outputFileObj.close()

Now that we have the basics of reading and writing files, let’s look at the source code to the
transposition file cipher program.

How the Program Works
transpositionFileCipher.py

1. # Transposition Cipher Encrypt/Decrypt File
2. # http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed)
3.
4. import time, os, sys, transpositionEncrypt, transpositionDecrypt
5.

160

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

6. def main():
7.
inputFilename = 'frankenstein.txt'
8.
# BE CAREFUL! If a file with the outputFilename name already exists,
9.
# this program will overwrite that file.
10.
outputFilename = 'frankenstein.encrypted.txt'
11.
myKey = 10
12.
myMode = 'encrypt' # set to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'

The first part of the program should look familiar. Line 4 is an import statement for our
transpositionEncrypt.py and transpositionDecrypt.py programs. It also imports the Python’s
time, os, and sys modules.
The main() function will be called after the def statements have been executed to define all
the functions in the program. The inputFilename variable holds a string of the file to read,
and the encrypted (or decrypted) text is written to the file with the name in outputFilename.
The transposition cipher uses an integer for a key, stored in myKey. If 'encrypt' is stored in
myMode, the program will encrypt the contents of the inputFilename file. If 'decrypt' is
stored in myMode, the contents of inputFilename will be decrypted.

The os.path.exists() Function
Reading files is always harmless, but we need to be careful when writing files. If we call the
open() function in write mode with a filename that already exists, that file will first be deleted
to make way for the new file. This means we could accidentally erase an important file if we pass
the important file’s name to the open() function. Using the os.path.exists() function,
we can check if a file with a certain filename already exists.
The os.path.exists() file has a single string parameter for the filename, and returns True
if this file already exists and False if it doesn’t. The os.path.exists() function exists
inside the path module, which itself exists inside the os module. But if we import the os
module, the path module will be imported too.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import os
>>> os.path.exists('abcdef')
False
>>> os.path.exists('C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe')
True
>>>

calc.exe file does not exist on OS X or Linux.)

# If the input file does not exist, then the program terminates early.
if not os.path.exists(inputFilename):
print('The file %s does not exist. Quitting...' % (inputFilename))
sys.exit()

We use the os.path.exists() function to check that the filename in inputFilename
actually exists. Otherwise, we have no file to encrypt or decrypt. In that case, we display a
message to the user and then quit the program.

sys.exit()

If the file the program will write to already exists, the user is asked to type in “C” if they want to
continue running the program or “Q” to quit the program.
The string in the response variable will have lower() called on it, and the returned string from
lower() will have the string method startswith() called on it. The startswith()
method will return True if its string argument can be found at the beginning of the string. Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'hello'.startswith('h')
True
>>> 'hello world!'.startswith('hello wo')
True
>>> 'hello'.startswith('H')
False
>>> spam = 'Albert'
>>> spam.startswith('Al')
True

On line 23, if the user did not type in 'c', 'continue', 'C', or another string that begins
with C, then sys.exit() will be called to end the program. Technically, the user doesn’t have
to enter “Q” to quit; any string that does not begin with “C” will cause the sys.exit() function to
be called to quit the program.
There is also an endswith() string method that can be used to check if a string value ends with
another certain string value. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello world!'.endswith('world!')
True
>>> 'Hello world!'.endswith('world')
False
>>>

The title() String Method
Just like the lower() and upper() string methods will return a string in lowercase or
uppercase, the title() string method returns a string in “title case”. Title case is where every
word is uppercase for the first character and lowercase for the rest of the characters. Try typing
the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'hello'.title()
'Hello'
>>> 'HELLO'.title()
'Hello'
>>> 'hElLo'.title()
'Hello'
>>> 'hello world! HOW ARE YOU?'.title()
'Hello World! How Are You?'

Lines 27 to 29 open the file with the name stored in inputFilename and read in its contents
into the content variable. On line 31, we display a message telling the user that the encryption
or decryption has begun. Since myMode should either contain the string 'encrypt' or
'decrypt', calling the title() string method will either display 'Encrypting...' or
'Decrypting...'.

The time Module and time.time() Function
All computers have a clock that keeps track of the current date and time. Your Python programs
can access this clock by calling the time.time() function. (This is a function named time()
that is in a module named time.)
The time.time() function will return a float value of the number of seconds since January 1st,
1970. This moment is called the Unix Epoch. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import time
>>> time.time()
1349411356.892
>>> time.time()
1349411359.326
>>>

The float value shows that the time.time() function can be precise down to a millisecond
(that is, 1/1,000 of a second). Of course, the numbers that time.time() displays for you will
depend on the moment in time that you call this function. It might not be clear that
1349411356.892 is Thursday, October 4th, 2012 around 9:30 pm. However, the time.time()
function is useful for comparing the number of seconds between calls to time.time(). We can
use this function to determine how long our program has been running.

startTime = time.time()
if myMode == 'encrypt':

elif myMode == 'decrypt':
translated = transpositionDecrypt.decryptMessage(myKey, content)
totalTime = round(time.time() - startTime, 2)
print('%sion time: %s seconds' % (myMode.title(), totalTime))

We want to measure how long the encryption or decryption process takes for the contents of the
file. Lines 35 to 38 call the encryptMessage() or decryptMessage() (depending on
whether 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' is stored in the myMode variable). Before this code

164

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

however, we will call time.time() and store the current time in a variable named
startTime.
On line 39 after the encryption or decryption function calls have returned, we will call
time.time() again and subtract startTime from it. This will give us the number of seconds
between the two calls to time.time().
For example, if you subtract the floating point values returned when I called time.time()
before in the interactive shell, you would get the amount of time in between those calls while I
was typing:
>>> 1349411359.326 - 1349411356.892
2.434000015258789
>>>

(The difference Python calculated between the two floating point values is not precise due to
rounding errors, which cause very slight inaccuracies when doing math with floats. For our
programs, it will not matter. But you can read more about rounding errors at
http://invpy.com/rounding.)
The time.time() - startTime expression evaluates to a value that is passed to the
round() function which rounds to the nearest two decimal points. This value is stored in
totalTime. On line 40, the amount of time is displayed to the user by calling print().

string will be forgotten when the program terminates, so we want to write the string out to a file
to store it on the hard drive. The code on lines 43 to 45 do this by opening a new file (passing
'w' to open() to open the file in write mode) and then calling the write() file object
method.

Summary
Congratulations! There wasn’t much to this new program aside from the open(), write(),
read(), and close() functions, but this lets us encrypt text files on our hard drive that are
megabytes or gigabytes in size. It doesn’t take much new code because all of the implementation
for the cipher has already been written. We can extend our programs (such as adding file reading
and writing capabilities) by importing their functions for use in new programs. This greatly
increases our ability to use computers to encrypt information.
There are too many possible keys to simply brute-force and examine the output of a message
encrypted with the transposition cipher. But if we can write a program that recognizes English (as
opposed to strings of gibberish), we can have the computer examine the output of thousands of
decryption attempts and determine which key can successfully decrypt a message to English.

A message encrypted with the transposition cipher can have thousands of possible keys. Your
computer can still easily brute-force this many keys, but you would then have to look through
thousands of decryptions to find the one correct plaintext. This is a big problem for the bruteforce method of cracking the transposition cipher.
When the computer decrypts a message with the wrong key, the resulting plaintext is garbage
text. We need to program the computer to be able to recognize if the plaintext is garbage text or
English text. That way, if the computer decrypts with the wrong key, it knows to go on and try the
next possible key. And when the computer tries a key that decrypts to English text, it can stop and
bring that key to the attention of the cryptanalyst. Now the cryptanalyst won’t have to look
through thousands of incorrect decryptions.

How Can a Computer Understand English?
It can’t. At least, not in the way that human beings like you or I understand English. Computers
don’t really understand math, chess, or lethal military androids either, any more than a clock
understands lunchtime. Computers just execute instructions one after another. But these
instructions can mimic very complicated behaviors that solve math problems, win at chess, or
hunt down the future leaders of the human resistance.
Ideally, what we need is a Python function (let’s call it isEnglish()) that has a string passed
to it and then returns True if the string is English text and False if it’s random gibberish. Let’s
take a look at some English text and some garbage text and try to see what patterns the two have:
Robots are your friends. Except for RX-686. She will try to eat you.
ai-pey

e. xrx ne augur iirl6 Rtiyt fhubE6d hrSei t8..ow eo.telyoosEs

t

One thing we can notice is that the English text is made up of words that you could find in a
dictionary, but the garbage text is made up of words that you won’t. Splitting up the string into
individual words is easy. There is already a Python string method named split() that will do
this for us (this method will be explained later). The split() method just sees when each word
begins or ends by looking for the space characters. Once we have the individual words, we can
test to see if each word is a word in the dictionary with code like this:
if word == 'aardvark' or word == 'abacus' or word == 'abandon' or word ==
'abandoned' or word == 'abbreviate' or word == 'abbreviation' or word ==
'abdomen' or …

We can write code like that, but we probably shouldn’t. The computer won’t mind running
through all this code, but you wouldn’t want to type it all out. Besides, somebody else has already

168

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

typed out a text file full of nearly all English words. These text files are called dictionary files.
So we just need to write a function that checks if the words in the string exist somewhere in that
file.
Remember, a dictionary file is a text file that contains a large list of English words. A dictionary
value is a Python value that has key-value pairs.
Not every word will exist in our “dictionary file”. Maybe the dictionary file is incomplete and
doesn’t have the word, say, “aardvark”. There are also perfectly good decryptions that might have
non-English words in them, such as “RX-686” in our above English sentence. (Or maybe the
plaintext is in a different language besides English. But we’ll just assume it is in English for
now.)
And garbage text might just happen to have an English word or two in it by coincidence. For
example, it turns out the word “augur” means a person who tries to predict the future by studying
the way birds are flying. Seriously.
So our function will not be foolproof. But if most of the words in the string argument are English
words, it is a good bet to say that the string is English text. It is a very low probability that a
ciphertext will decrypt to English if decrypted with the wrong key.
The dictionary text file will have one word per line in uppercase. It will look like this:
AARHUS
AARON
ABABA
ABACK
ABAFT
ABANDON
ABANDONED
ABANDONING
ABANDONMENT
ABANDONS

…and so on. You can download this entire file (which has over 45,000 words) from
http://invpy.com/dictionary.txt.
Our isEnglish() function will have to split up a decrypted string into words, check if each
word is in a file full of thousands of English words, and if a certain amount of the words are
English words, then we will say that the text is in English. And if the text is in English, then
there’s a good bet that we have decrypted the ciphertext with the correct key.
And that is how the computer can understand if a string is English or if it is gibberish.

The Detect English Module
The detectEnglish.py program that we write in this chapter isn’t a program that runs by itself.
Instead, it will be imported by our encryption programs so that they can call the
detectEnglish.isEnglish() function. This is why we don’t give detectEnglish.py a
main() function. The other functions in the program are all provided for isEnglish() to
call.

Source Code for the Detect English Module
Open a new file editor window by clicking on File ► New Window. Type in the following code
into the file editor, and then save it as detectEnglish.py. Press F5 to run the program.

detectEnglish.py

13. def loadDictionary():
14.
dictionaryFile = open('dictionary.txt')

The dictionary file sits on the user’s hard drive, but we need to load the text in this file as a string
value so our Python code can use it. First, we get a file object by calling open() and passing the
string of the filename 'dictionary.txt'. Before we continue with the
loadDictionary() code, let’s learn about the dictionary data type.

Dictionaries and the Dictionary Data Type
The dictionary data type has values which can contain multiple other values, just like lists do. In
list values, you use an integer index value to retrieve items in the list, like spam[42]. For each
item in the dictionary value, there is a key used to retrieve it. (Values stored inside lists and
dictionaries are also sometimes called items.) The key can be an integer or a string value, like
spam['hello'] or spam[42]. Dictionaries let us organize our program’s data with even
more flexibility than lists.
Instead of typing square brackets like list values, dictionary values (or simply, dictionaries) use
curly braces. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> emptyList = []
>>> emptyDictionary = {}
>>>

A dictionary’s values are typed out as key-value pairs, which are separated by colons. Multiple
key-value pairs are separated by commas. To retrieve values from a dictionary, just use square

172

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

brackets with the key in between them (just like indexing with lists). Try typing the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = {'key1':'This is a value', 'key2':42}
>>> spam['key1']
'This is a value'
>>> spam['key2']
42
>>>

It is important to know that, just as with lists, variables do not store dictionary values themselves,
but references to dictionaries. The example code below has two variables with references to the
same dictionary:
>>> spam = {'hello': 42}
>>> eggs = spam
>>> eggs['hello'] = 99
>>> eggs
{'hello': 99}
>>> spam
{'hello': 99}
>>>

Adding or Changing Items in a Dictionary
You can add or change values in a dictionary with indexes as well. Try typing the following into
the interactive shell:
>>> spam = {42:'hello'}
>>> print(spam[42])
hello
>>> spam[42] = 'goodbye'
>>> print(spam[42])
goodbye
>>>

And just like lists can contain other lists, dictionaries can also contain other dictionaries (or lists).
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> foo = {'fizz': {'name': 'Al', 'age': 144}, 'moo':['a', 'brown', 'cow']}
>>> foo['fizz']
{'age': 144, 'name': 'Al'}
>>> foo['fizz']['name']

'Al'
>>> foo['moo']
['a', 'brown', 'cow']
>>> foo['moo'][1]
'brown'
>>>

Practice Exercises, Chapter 12, Set B
Practice exercises can be found at http://invpy.com/hackingpractice12B.

Using the len() Function with Dictionaries
The len() function can tell you how many items are in a list or how many characters are in a
string, but it can also tell you how many items are in a dictionary as well. Try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>>
>>>
0
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>
3
>>>

spam = {}
len(spam)
spam['name'] = 'Al'
spam['pet'] = 'Zophie the cat'
spam['age'] = 89
len(spam)

Using the in Operator with Dictionaries
The in operator can also be used to see if a certain key value exists in a dictionary. It is important
to remember that the in operator checks if a key exists in the dictionary, not a value. Try typing
the following into the interactive shell:
>>> eggs = {'foo': 'milk', 'bar': 'bread'}
>>> 'foo' in eggs
True
>>> 'blah blah blah' in eggs
False
>>> 'milk' in eggs
False
>>> 'bar' in eggs
True
>>> 'bread' in eggs
False

174

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

>>>

The not in operator works with dictionary values as well.

Using for Loops with Dictionaries
You can also iterate over the keys in a dictionary with for loops, just like you can iterate over
the items in a list. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = {'name':'Al', 'age':99}
>>> for k in spam:
...
print(k)
...
print(spam[k])
...
print('==========')
...
age
99
==========
name
Al
==========
>>>

The Difference Between Dictionaries and Lists
Dictionaries are like lists in many ways, but there are a few important differences:
1. Dictionary items are not in any order. There is no “first” or “last” item in a dictionary like
there is in a list.
2. Dictionaries do not have concatenation with the + operator. If you want to add a new
item, you can just use indexing with a new key. For example, foo['a new key'] =
'a string'
3. Lists only have integer index values that range from 0 to the length of the list minus one.
But dictionaries can have any key. If you have a dictionary stored in a variable spam,
then you can store a value in spam[3] without needing values for spam[0],
spam[1], or spam[2] first.

Finding Items is Faster with Dictionaries Than Lists
detectEnglish.py

15.

englishWords = {}

In the loadDictionary() function, we will store all the words in the “dictionary file” (as in,
a file that has all the words in an English dictionary book) in a dictionary value (as in, the Python
data type.) The similar names are unfortunate, but they are two completely different things.
We could have also used a list to store the string values of each word from the dictionary file. The
reason we use a dictionary is because the in operator works faster on dictionaries than lists.
Imagine that we had the following list and dictionary values:
>>> listVal = ['spam', 'eggs', 'bacon']
>>> dictionaryVal = {'spam':0, 'eggs':0, 'bacon':0}

Python can evaluate the expression 'bacon' in dictionaryVal a little bit faster than
'bacon' in listVal. The reason is technical and you don’t need to know it for the
purposes of this book (but you can read more about it at http://invpy.com/listvsdict). This faster
speed doesn’t make that much of a difference for lists and dictionaries with only a few items in
them like in the above example. But our detectEnglish module will have tens of thousands
of items, and the expression word in ENGLISH_WORDS will be evaluated many times when
the isEnglish() function is called. The speed difference really adds up for the
detectEnglish module.

The split() Method
The split() string method returns a list of several strings. The “split” between each string
occurs wherever a space is. For an example of how the split() string method works, try typing
this into the shell:
>>> 'My very energetic mother
just served us Nutella.'.split()
['My', 'very', 'energetic', 'mother', 'just', 'served', 'us', 'Nutella.']
>>>

The result is a list of eight strings, one string for each of the words in the original string. The
spaces are dropped from the items in the list (even if there is more than one space). You can pass
an optional argument to the split() method to tell it to split on a different string other than just
a space. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'helloXXXworldXXXhowXXXareXXyou?'.split('XXX')

176

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

['hello', 'world', 'how', 'areXXyou?']
>>>

detectEnglish.py

16.

for word in dictionaryFile.read().split('\n'):

Line 16 is a for loop that will set the word variable to each value in the list
dictionaryFile.read().split('\n'). Let’s break this expression down.
dictionaryFile is the variable that stores the file object of the opened file. The
dictionaryFile.read() method call will read the entire file and return it as a very large
string value. On this string, we will call the split() method and split on newline characters.
This split() call will return a list value made up of each word in the dictionary file (because
the dictionary file has one word per line.)
This is why the expression dictionaryFile.read().split('\n') will evaluate to a
list of string values. Since the dictionary text file has one word on each line, the strings in the list
that split() returns will each have one word.

The None Value
None is a special value that you can assign to a variable. The None value represents the lack of
a value. None is the only value of the data type NoneType. (Just like how the Boolean data type
has only two values, the NoneType data type has only one value, None.) It can be very useful to
use the None value when you need a value that means “does not exist”. The None value is
always written without quotes and with a capital “N” and lowercase “one”.
For example, say you had a variable named quizAnswer which holds the user's answer to some
True-False pop quiz question. You could set quizAnswer to None if the user skipped the
question and did not answer it. Using None would be better because if you set it to True or
False before assigning the value of the user's answer, it may look like the user gave an answer
for the question even though they didn't.
Calls to functions that do not return anything (that is, they exit by reaching the end of the function
and not from a return statement) will evaluate to None.

englishWords[word] = None

In our program, we only use a dictionary for the englishWords variable so that the in
operator can find keys in it. We don’t care what is stored for each key, so we will just use the
None value. The for loop that starts on line 16 will iterate over each word in the dictionary file,
and line 17 will use that word as a key in englishWords with None stored for that key.

dictionaryFile.close()
return englishWords

After the for loop finishes, the englishWords dictionary will have tens of thousands of keys
in it. At this point, we close the file object since we are done reading from it and then return
englishWords.
detectEnglish.py

21. ENGLISH_WORDS = loadDictionary()

Line 21 calls loadDictionary() and stores the dictionary value it returns in a variable
named ENGLISH_WORDS. We want to call loadDictionary() before the rest of the code in
the detectEnglish module, but Python has to execute the def statement for
loadDictionary() before we can call the function. This is why the assignment for
ENGLISH_WORDS comes after the loadDictionary() function’s code.
detectEnglish.py

24. def getEnglishCount(message):
25.
message = message.upper()
26.
message = removeNonLetters(message)
27.
possibleWords = message.split()

The getEnglishCount() function will take one string argument and return a float value
indicating the amount of recognized English words in it. The value 0.0 will mean none of the
words in message are English words and 1.0 will mean all of the words in message are
English words, but most likely getEnglishCount() will return something in between 0.0
and 1.0. The isEnglish() function will use this return value as part of whether it returns
True or False.

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

First we must create a list of individual word strings from the string in message. Line 25 will
convert it to uppercase letters. Then line 26 will remove the non-letter characters from the string,
such as numbers and punctuation, by calling removeNonLetters(). (We will see how this
function works later.) Finally, the split() method on line 27 will split up the string into
individual words that are stored in a variable named possibleWords.
So if the string 'Hello there. How are you?' was passed when
getEnglishCount() was called, the value stored in possibleWords after lines 25 to 27
execute would be ['HELLO', 'THERE', 'HOW', 'ARE', 'YOU'].
detectEnglish.py

29.
30.

if possibleWords == []:
return 0.0 # no words at all, so return 0.0

If the string in message was something like '12345', all of these non-letter characters would
have been taken out of the string returned from removeNonLetters(). The call to
removeNonLetters() would return the blank string, and when split() is called on the
blank string, it will return an empty list.
Line 29 does a special check for this case, and returns 0.0. This is done to avoid a “divide-byzero” error (which is explained later on).

matches = 0
for word in possibleWords:
if word in ENGLISH_WORDS:
matches += 1

The float value that is returned from getEnglishCount() ranges between 0.0 and 1.0. To
produce this number, we will divide the number of the words in possibleWords that are
recognized as English by the total number of words in possibleWords.
The first part of this is to count the number of recognized English words in possibleWords,
which is done on lines 32 to 35. The matches variable starts off as 0. The for loop on line 33
will loop over each of the words in possibleWords, and checks if the word exists in the
ENGLISH_WORDS dictionary. If it does, the value in matches is incremented on line 35.
Once the for loop has completed, the number of English words is stored in the matches
variable. Note that technically this is only the number of words that are recognized as English
because they existed in our dictionary text file. As far as the program is concerned, if the word
exists in dictionary.txt, then it is a real English word. And if it doesn’t exist in the dictionary file,

it is not an English word. We are relying on the dictionary file to be accurate and complete in
order for the detectEnglish module to work correctly.

“Divide by Zero” Errors
detectEnglish.py

36.

return float(matches) / len(possibleWords)

Returning a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 is a simple matter of dividing the number of
recognized words by the total number of words.
However, whenever we divide numbers using the / operator in Python, we should be careful not
to cause a “divide-by-zero” error. In mathematics, dividing by zero has no meaning. If we try to
get Python to do it, it will result in an error. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 42 / 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
42 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: int division or modulo by zero
>>>

But a divide by zero can’t possibly happen on line 36. The only way it could is if
len(possibleWords) evaluated to 0. And the only way that would be possible is if
possibleWords were the empty list. However, our code on lines 29 and 30 specifically checks
for this case and returns 0.0. So if possibleWords had been set to the empty list, the
program execution would have never gotten past line 30 and line 36 would not cause a “divideby-zero” error.

The float(), int(), and str() Functions and Integer
Division
detectEnglish.py

36.

return float(matches) / len(possibleWords)

The value stored in matches is an integer. However, we pass this integer to the float()
function which returns a float version of that number. Try typing the following into the interactive
shell:
>>> float(42)
42.0

180

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

>>>

The int() function returns an integer version of its argument, and the str() function returns a
string. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> float(42)
42.0
>>> int(42.0)
42
>>> int(42.7)
42
>>> int("42")
42
>>> str(42)
'42'
>>> str(42.7)
'42.7'
>>>

The float(), int(), and str() functions are helpful if you need a value’s equivalent in a
different data type. But you might be wondering why we pass matches to float() on line 36
in the first place.
The reason is to make our detectEnglish module work with Python 2. Python 2 will do
integer division when both values in the division operation are integers. This means that the result
will be rounded down. So using Python 2, 22 / 7 will evaluate to 3. However, if one of the
values is a float, Python 2 will do regular division: 22.0 / 7 will evaluate to
3.142857142857143. This is why line 36 calls float(). This is called making the code
backwards compatible with previous versions.
Python 3 always does regular division no matter if the values are floats or ints.

The previously explained getEnglishCount() function calls the removeNonLetters()
function to return a string that is the passed argument, except with all the numbers and
punctuation characters removed.
The code in removeNonLetters() starts with a blank list and loops over each character in
the message argument. If the character exists in the LETTERS_AND_SPACE string, then it is
added to the end of the list. If the character is a number or punctuation mark, then it won’t exist in
the LETTERS_AND_SPACE string and won’t be added to the list.

The append() List Method
detectEnglish.py

42.
43.

if symbol in LETTERS_AND_SPACE:
lettersOnly.append(symbol)

Line 42 checks if symbol (which is set to a single character on each iteration of line 41’s for
loop) exists in the LETTERS_AND_SPACE string. If it does, then it is added to the end of the
lettersOnly list with the append() list method.
If you want to add a single value to the end of a list, you could put the value in its own list and
then use list concatenation to add it. Try typing the following into the interactive shell, where the
value 42 is added to the end of the list stored in spam:
>>>
>>>
[2,
>>>
>>>
[2,
>>>

spam = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
spam
3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
spam = spam + [42]
spam
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 42]

When we add a value to the end of a list, we say we are appending the value to the list. This is
done with lists so frequently in Python that there is an append() list method which takes a
single argument to append to the end of the list. Try typing the following into the shell:
>>> eggs = []
>>> eggs.append('hovercraft')
>>> eggs
['hovercraft']
>>> eggs.append('eels')
>>> eggs
['hovercraft', 'eels']
>>> eggs.append(42)
>>> eggs
['hovercraft', 'eels', 42]
>>>

For technical reasons, using the append() method is faster than putting a value in a list and
adding it with the + operator. The append() method modifies the list in-place to include the
new value. You should always prefer the append() method for adding values to the end of a
list.

return ''.join(lettersOnly)

After line 41’s for loop is done, only the letter and space characters are in the lettersOnly
list. To make a single string value from this list of strings, we call the join() string method on
a blank string. This will join the strings in lettersOnly together with a blank string (that is,
nothing) between them. This string value is then returned as removeNonLetters()’s return
value.

Default Arguments
detectEnglish.py

47. def isEnglish(message, wordPercentage=20, letterPercentage=85):
48.
# By default, 20% of the words must exist in the dictionary file, and
49.
# 85% of all the characters in the message must be letters or spaces
50.
# (not punctuation or numbers).

The isEnglish() function will accept a string argument and return a Boolean value that
indicates whether or not it is English text. But when you look at line 47, you can see it has three
parameters. The second and third parameters (wordPercentage and letterPercentage)
have equal signs and values next to them. These are called default arguments. Parameters that
have default arguments are optional. If the function call does not pass an argument for these
parameters, the default argument is used by default.
If isEnglish() is called with only one argument, the default arguments are used for the
wordPercentage (the integer 20) and letterPercentage (the integer 85) parameters.
Table 12-1 shows function calls to isEnglish(), and what they are equivalent to:
Table 12-1. Function calls with and without default arguments.
Function Call

isEnglish('Hello', 50, 60)

isEnglish('Hello',
letterPercentage=60)

isEnglish('Hello', 20, 60)

184

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

When isEnglish() is called with no second and third argument, the function will require that
20% of the words in message are English words that exist in the dictionary text file and 85% of
the characters in message are letters. These percentages work for detecting English in most
cases. But sometimes a program calling isEnglish() will want looser or more restrictive
thresholds. If so, a program can just pass arguments for wordPercentage and
letterPercentage instead of using the default arguments.

Calculating Percentage
A percentage is a number between 0 and 100 that shows how much of something there is
proportional to the total number of those things. In the string value 'Hello cat MOOSE
fsdkl ewpin' there are five “words” but only three of them are English words. To calculate
the percentage of English words, you divide the number of English words by the total
number of words and multiply by 100. The percentage of English words in 'Hello cat
MOOSE fsdkl ewpin' is 3 / 5 * 100, which is 60.
Table 12-2 shows some percentage calculations:

The percentage will always be between 0% (meaning none of the words) and 100% (meaning all
of the words). Our isEnglish() function will consider a string to be English if at least 20% of
the words are English words that exist in the dictionary file and 85% of the characters in the
string are letters (or spaces).
detectEnglish.py

51.

wordsMatch = getEnglishCount(message) * 100 >= wordPercentage

Line 51 calculates the percentage of recognized English words in message by passing
message to getEnglishCount(), which does the division for us and returns a float
between 0.0 and 1.0. To get a percentage from this float, we just have to multiply it by 100. If
this number is greater than or equal to the wordPercentage parameter, then True is stored in

value.) Otherwise, False is stored in wordsMatch.

52.
53.
54.

numLetters = len(removeNonLetters(message))
messageLettersPercentage = float(numLetters) / len(message) * 100
lettersMatch = messageLettersPercentage >= letterPercentage

Lines 52 to 54 calculate the percentage of letter characters in the message string. To determine
the percentage of letter (and space) characters in message, our code must divide the number of
letter characters by the total number of characters in message. Line 52 calls
removeNonLetters(message). This call will return a string that has the number and
punctuation characters removed from the string. Passing this string to len() will return the
number of letter and space characters that were in message. This integer is stored in the
numLetters variable.
Line 53 determines the percentage of letters getting a float version of the integer in
numLetters and dividing this by len(message). The return value of len(message) will
be the total number of characters in message. (The call to float() was made so that if the
programmer who imports our detectEnglish module is running Python 2, the division done
on line 53 will always be regular division instead of integer division.)
Line 54 checks if the percentage in messageLettersPercentage is greater than or equal to
the letterPercentage parameter. This expression evaluates to a Boolean value that is stored
in lettersMatch.
detectEnglish.py

55.

return wordsMatch and lettersMatch

We want isEnglish() to return True only if both the wordsMatch and lettersMatch
variables contain True, so we put them in an expression with the and operator. If both the
wordsMatch and lettersMatch variables are True, then isEnglish() will declare that
the message argument is English and return True. Otherwise, isEnglish() will return
False.

Summary
The dictionary data type is useful because like a list it can contain multiple values. However
unlike the list, we can index values in it with string values instead of only integers. Most of the
the things we can do with lists we can also do with dictionaries, such as pass it to len() or use
the in and not in operators on it. In fact, using the in operator on a very large dictionary
value executes much faster than using in on a very large list.
The NoneType data type is also a new data type introduced in this chapter. It only has one value:
None. This value is very useful for representing a lack of a value.
We can convert values to other data types by using the int(), float(), and str() functions.
This chapter brings up “divide-by-zero” errors, which we need to add code to check for and
avoid. The split() string method can convert a single string value into a list value of many
strings. The split() string method is sort of the reverse of the join() list method. The
append() list method adds a value to the end of the list.
When we define functions, we can give some of the parameters “default arguments”. If no
argument is passed for these parameters when the function is called, the default argument value is
used instead. This can be a useful shortcut in our programs.
The transposition cipher is an improvement over the Caesar cipher because it can have hundreds
or thousands of possible keys for messages instead of just 26 different keys. A computer has no
problem decrypting a message with thousands of different keys, but to hack this cipher, we need
to write code that can determine if a string value is valid English or not.
Since this code will probably be useful in our other hacking programs, we will put it in its own
module so it can be imported by any program that wants to call its isEnglish() function. All
of the work we’ve done in this chapter is so that any program can do the following:
>>> import detectEnglish
>>> detectEnglish.isEnglish('Is this sentence English text?')
True
>>>

Now armed with code that can detect English, let’s move on to the next chapter and hack the
transposition cipher!

 Multi-line Strings with Triple Quotes
 The strip() String Method
To hack the transposition cipher, we will use a brute-force approach. Of the thousands of keys,
the correct key is most likely that only one that will result in readable English. We developed
English-detection code in the last chapter so the program can realize when it has found the correct
key.

to press “D” and then Enter. If the decryption is a false positive, the user can just press Enter and
the program will continue to try other keys.
Run the program again and skip the correct decryption by just pressing Enter. The program
assumes that it was not a correct decryption and continues brute-forcing through the other
possible keys. Eventually the program runs through all the possible keys and then gives up,
telling the user that it was unable to hack the ciphertext:

Chapter 13 – Hacking the Transposition Cipher

191

The ciphertext to be hacked is stored in the myMessage variable. Line 9 has a string value that
begins and ends with triple quotes. These strings do not have to have literal single and double
quotes escaped inside of them. Triple quote strings are also called multi-line strings, because they
can also contain actual newlines within them. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = """Dear Alice,
Why did you dress up my hamster in doll clothing?
I look at Mr. Fuzz and think, "I know this was Alice's doing."
Sincerely,
Bob"""
>>> print(spam)
Dear Alice,
Why did you dress up my hamster in doll clothing?
I look at Mr. Fuzz and think, "I know this was Alice's doing."
Sincerely,
Bob
>>>

Notice that this string value can span over multiple lines. Everything after the opening triple
quotes will be interpreted as part of the string until it reaches triple quotes ending it. Multi-line
strings can either use three double quote characters or three single quote characters.
Multi-line strings are useful for putting very large strings into the source code for a program,
which is why it is used on line 9 to store the ciphertext to be broken.

The ciphertext hacking code exists inside the hackTransposition() function. This function
takes one string argument: the encrypted ciphertext message to be broken. If the function can
hack the ciphertext, it returns a string of the decrypted text. Otherwise, it returns the None value.
This value is stored in the hackedMessage variable.

if hackedMessage == None:

If None was stored in hackedMessage, the program prints that it was unable to break the
encryption on the message.

Because there are many keys the program can go through, the program displays a message to the

can press Ctrl-C (on Windows) or Ctrl-D (on OS X and Linux) to exit the program at any point.

The range of possible keys for the transposition cipher is the integers between 1 and the length of
the message. The for loop on line 29 will run the hacking part of the function with each of these
keys.
To provide feedback to the user, the key that is being tested is printed to the string on line 30,

print('Key %s: %s' % (key, decryptedText[:100]))

print('Enter D for done, or just press Enter to continue

The decrypted output in decryptedText will most likely only be English if the correct key
was used (otherwise, it will appear to be random garbage). The string in decryptedText is
passed to the detectEnglish.isEnglish() function we wrote in the last chapter.
But just because detectEnglish.isEnglish() returns True (making the program
execution enter the block following the if statement on line 34) doesn’t mean the program has
found the correct key. It could be a “false positive”. To be sure, line 38 prints out the first 100
characters of the decryptedText string (by using the slice decryptedText[:100]) on
the screen for the user to look at.
The program pauses when line 41 executes, waiting for the user to type something in either D on
nothing before pressing Enter. This input is stored as a string in response.

The strip() String Method
The strip() string method returns a version of the string that has any
whitespace at the beginning and end of the string stripped out. Try typing in
the following into the interactive shell:
>>> '
Hello'.strip()
'Hello'
>>> 'Hello
'.strip()
'Hello'
>>> '
Hello World
'.strip()
'Hello World'
>>> 'Hello
x'.strip()
'Hello
x'
>>>

The strip() method can also have a string argument passed to it that tells the method which
characters should be removed from the start and end of the string instead of removing whitespace.

194

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The whitespace characters are the space character, the tab character, and the newline
character. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Helloxxxxxx'.strip('x')
'Hello'
>>> 'aaaaaHELLOaa'.strip('a')
'HELLO'
>>> 'ababaHELLOab'.strip('ab')
'HELLO'
>>> 'abccabcbacbXYZabcXYZacccab'.strip('abc')
'XYZabcXYZ'
>>>

if response.strip().upper().startswith('D'):
return decryptedText

The expression on line 43 used for the if statement’s condition lets the user have some
flexibility with what has to be typed in. If the condition were response == 'D', then the user
would have to type in exactly “D” and nothing else in order to end the program.
If the user typed in 'd' or '
D' or 'Done' then the condition would be False and the
program would continue. To avoid this, the string in response has any whitespace removed
from the start or end with the call to strip(). Then the string that response.strip()
evaluates to has the upper() method called on it. If the user typed in either “d” or “D”, the
string returned from upper() will be 'D'. Little things like this make our programs easier for
the user to use.
If the user has indicated that the decrypted string is correct, the decrypted text is returned from
hackTransposition() on line 44.

Line 46 is the first line after the for loop that began on line 29. If the program execution reaches
this point, it’s because the return statement on line 44 was never reached. That would only
happen if the correctly decrypted text was never found for any of the keys that were tried.
In that case, line 46 returns the None value to indicate that the hacking has failed.

Summary
This chapter was short like the “Breaking the Caesar Cipher with the Brute-Force Technique”
chapter because (also like that chapter) most of the code was already written in other programs.
Our hacking program can import functions from these other programs by importing them as
modules.
The strip() string method is useful for removing whitespace (or other) characters from the
beginning or end of a string. If we use triple quotes, then a string value can span across multiple
lines in our source code.
The detectEnglish.py program removes a lot of the work of inspecting the decrypted output to see
if it’s English. This allows the brute-force technique to be applied to a cipher that can have
thousands of keys.
Our programs are becoming more sophisticated. Before we learn the next cipher, we should learn
how to use Python’s debugger tool to help us find bugs in our programs.

Chapter 14 – Modular Arithmetic and the Multiplicative Cipher

197

The multiplicative and affine ciphers are similar to the Caesar cipher, except instead of adding a
key to a symbol’s index in a string, these ciphers use multiplication. But before we learn how to
encrypt and decrypt with these ciphers, we’re going to need to learn a little math. This knowledge
is also needed for the last cipher in this book, the RSA cipher.

Oh No Math!
Don’t let it scare you that you need to learn some math. The principles here are easy to learn from
pictures, and we’ll see that they are directly useful in cryptography.

Math Oh Yeah!
That’s more like it.

Modular Arithmetic (aka Clock Arithmetic)
This is a clock in which I’ve replaced the 12 with a 0. (I’m a programmer. I think it’s weird that
the day begins at 12 AM instead of 0 AM.) Ignore the hour, minute, and second hands. We just
need to pay attention to the numbers.

Figure 14-1. A clock with a zero o’clock.

198

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

3 O’Clock + 5 Hours = 8 O’Clock
If the current time is 3 o’clock, what time will it be in 5 hours? This is
easy enough to figure out. 3 + 5 = 8. It will be 8 o’clock. Think of the
hour hand on the clock in Figure 14-1 starting at 3, and then moving 5
hours clockwise. It will end up at 8. This is one way we can doublecheck our math.

10 O’Clock + 5 Hours = 3 O’Clock
If the current time is 10 o’clock, what time will it be in 5 hours? If you
add 10 + 5, you get 15. But 15 o’clock doesn’t make sense for clocks
like the one to the right. It only goes up to 12. So to find out what time
it will be, we subtract 15 – 12 = 3. The answer is it will be 3 o’clock.
(Whether or not it is 3 AM or 3PM depends on if the current time is 10
AM or 10 PM. But it doesn’t matter for modular arithmetic.)
If you think of the hour hand as starting at 10 and then moving forward
5 hours, it will land on 3. So double-checking our math by moving the
hour hand clockwise shows us that we are correct.

10 O’Clock + 200 Hours = 6 O’Clock
If the current time is 10 o’clock, what time will it be in 200 hours? 200
+ 10 = 210, and 210 is larger than 12. So we subtract 210 – 12 = 198.
But 198 is still larger than 12, so we subtract 12 again. 198 – 12 = 186.
If we keep subtracting 12 until the difference is less than 12, we end up
with 6. If the current time is 10 o’clock, the time 200 hours later will be
6 o’clock.
If we wanted to double check our 10 o’clock + 200 hours math, we
would keep moving the hour hand around and around the clock face.
When we’ve moved the hour hand the 200th time, it will end up landing
on 6.

199

The % Mod Operator
This sort of “wrap-around” arithmetic is called modular arithmetic. We say “fifteen mod
twelve” is equal to 3. (Just like how “15 o’clock” mod twelve would be “3 o’clock.) In Python,
the mod operator is the % percent sign. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 15 % 12
3
>>> 210 % 12
6
>>> 10 % 10
0
>>> 20 % 10
0
>>>

“Mod” is “Division Remainder”(Sort Of)
You can think of the mod operator as a “division remainder” operator. 21 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 1.
And 21 % 5 = 1. This works pretty well for positive numbers, but not for negative numbers. -21 ÷
5 = -4 remainder -1. But the result of a mod operation will never be negative. Instead, think of
that -1 remainder as being the same as 5 – 1, which comes to 4. This is exactly what -21 % 5
evaluates to:
>>> -21 % 5
4
>>>

But for the purposes of cryptography in this book, we’ll only be modding positive numbers.

GCD: Greatest Common Divisor (aka Greatest Common Factor)
Factors are the numbers that can be multiplied to produce a particular number. Look at this
simple multiplication:
4 × 6 = 24
In the above math problem, we say 4 and 6 are factors of 24. (Another name for factor is
divisor.) The number 24 also has some other factors:

200

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

8 × 3 = 24
12 × 2 = 24
24 × 1 = 24
From the above three math problems, we can see that 8 and 3 are also factors of 24, as are 12 and
2, and 24 and 1. So we can say the factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.
Let’s look at the factors of 30:
1 × 30 = 30
2 × 15 = 30
3 × 10 = 30
5 × 6 = 30
So the factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. (Notice that any number will always have 1
and itself as factors.) If you look at the list of factors for 24 and 30, you can see that the factors
that they have in common are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest number of these is 6, so we call 6 the
greatest common factor (or, more commonly, the greatest common divisor) of 24 and 30.

Above are some rectangular blocks with a width of 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units, and so on. The block’s
length can be used to represent a number. You can count the number of squares in each block to
determine the length and number. These blocks (sometimes called Cuisenaire rods) can be used to
visualize math operations, like 3 + 2 = 5 or 5 × 3 = 15:

Figure 14-3. Using Cuisenaire rods to demonstrate addition and multiplication.
If we represent the number 30 as a block that is 30 units long, a number is a factor of 30 if the
number’s blocks can evenly fit with the 30-block. You can see that 3 and 10 are factors of 30:

Figure 14-4. Cuisenaire rods demonstrating factors.
But 4 and 7 are not factors of 30, because the 4-blocks and 7-blocks won’t evenly fit into the 30block:

The Greatest Common Divisor of two blocks (that is, two numbers represented by those blocks)

Multiple Assignment
Our GCD function will use Python’s multiple assignment trick. The multiple assignment trick lets
you assign more than one variable with a single assignment statement. Try typing the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> spam, eggs = 42, 'Hello'
>>> spam
42
>>> eggs
'Hello'
>>> a, b, c, d = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David']
>>> a
'Alice'
>>> b
'Bob'
>>> c
'Carol'
>>> d
'David'
>>>

The variable names on the left side of the = operator and the values on the right side of the =
operator are separated by a comma. You can also assign each of the values in a list to its own
variable, if the number of items in the list is the same as the number of variables on the left side
of the = operator.

Be sure to have the same number of variables as you have values, otherwise Python will raise an
error that says the call needs more or has too many values:
>>> a, b, c = 1, 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#8>", line 1, in <module>
a, b, c = 1, 2
ValueError: need more than 2 values to unpack
>>> a, b, c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#9>", line 1, in <module>
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
ValueError: too many values to unpack
>>>

Swapping Values with the Multiple Assignment Trick
One of the main uses of the multiple assignment trick is to swap the values in two variables. Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = 'hello'
>>> eggs = 'goodbye'
>>> spam, eggs = eggs, spam
>>> spam
'goodbye'
>>> eggs
'hello'

We will use this swapping trick in our implementation of Euclid’s algorithm.

Euclid’s Algorithm for Finding the GCD of Two Numbers
Figuring out the GCD of two numbers will be important for doing the multiplicative and affine
ciphers. It seems simple enough: just look at the numbers and write down any factors you can
think of, then compare the lists and find the largest number that is in both of them.
But to program a computer to do it, we’ll need to be more precise. We need an algorithm (that is,
a specific series of steps we execute) to find the GCD of two numbers.
A mathematician who lived 2,000 years ago named Euclid came up with an algorithm for finding
the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Here’s a statue of Euclid at Oxford University:

204

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Figure 14-7. Euclid may or may not have looked like this.
Of course since no likeness or description of Euclid exists in any historical document, no one
knows what he actually looked like at all. (Artists and sculptors just make it up.) This statue could
also be called, “Statue of Some Guy with a Beard”.
Euclid’s GCD algorithm is short. Here’s a function that implements his algorithm as Python code,
which returns the GCD of integers a and b:
def gcd(a, b):
while a != 0:
a, b = b % a, a
return b

If you call this function from the interactive shell and pass it 24 and 30 for the a and b
parameters, the function will return 6. You could have done this yourself with pencil and paper.
But since you’ve programmed a computer to do this, it can easily handle very large numbers:
>>> gcd(24, 30)
6
>>> gcd(409119243, 87780243)
6837
>>>

How Euclid’s algorithm works is beyond the scope of this book, but you can rely on this function
to return the GCD of the two integers you pass it.

“Relatively Prime”
Relatively prime numbers are used for the multiplicative and affine ciphers. We say that two
numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1. That is, the numbers a and b
are relatively prime to each other if gcd(a, b) == 1.

The Multiplicative Cipher
In the Caesar cipher, encrypting and decrypting symbols involved converting them to numbers,
adding or subtracting the key, and then converting the new number back to a symbol.
What if instead of adding the key to do the encryption, we use multiplication? There would be a
“wrap-around” issue, but the mod operator would solve that. For example, let’s use the symbol
set of just uppercase letters and the key 7. Here’s a list of the letters and their numbers:
0

To find what the symbol F encrypts to with key 7, multiply its number (5) by 7 and mod by 26 (to
handle the “wrap-around” with our 26-symbol set). Then use that number’s symbol. (5 × 7) mod
26 = 9, and 9 is the number for the symbol J. So F encrypts to J in the multiplicative cipher with
key 7. Do the same with all of the letters:

You will end up with this mapping for the key 7: to encrypt you replace the top letter with the
letter under it, and vice versa to decrypt:

↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕

It wouldn’t take long for an attacker to brute-force through the first 7 keys. But the good thing
about the multiplicative cipher is that it can work with very large keys, like 8,953,851 (which has
the letters of the alphabet map to the letters AXUROLIFCZWTQNKHEBYVSPMJGD). It would
take quite some time for a computer to brute-force through nearly nine million keys.

Multiplicative Cipher + Caesar Cipher = The Affine Cipher
One downside to the multiplicative cipher is that the letter A always maps to the letter A. This is
because A’s number is 0, and 0 multiplied by anything will always be 0. We can fix this by
adding a second key that performs a Caesar cipher encryption after the multiplicative cipher’s
multiplication and modding is done.
This is called the affine cipher. The affine cipher has two keys. “Key A” is the integer that the
letter’s number is multiplied by. After modding this number by 26, “Key B” is the integer that is
added to the number. This sum is also modded by 26, just like in the original Caesar cipher.
This means that the affine cipher has 26 times as many possible keys as the multiplicative cipher.
It also ensures that the letter A does not always encrypt to the letter A.

Figure 14-8. The encryption and decryption are mirrors of each other.

The First Affine Key Problem
There are two problems with the multiplicative cipher’s key and affine cipher’s Key A. You
cannot just use any number for Key A. For example, if you chose the key 8, here is the mapping
you would end up with:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕
A I Q Y G O W E M U C K S A I Q Y G O W E M U C K S
This mapping doesn’t work at all! Both the letters C and P encrypt to Q. When we encounter a Q
in the ciphertext, how do we know which it decrypts to?! The same problem exists for encrypting
A and N, F and S, and many others.

208

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

So some keys will work in the affine cipher while others will not. The secret to determining
which key numbers will work is this:
In the affine cipher, the Key A number and the size of the symbol set must be relatively
prime to each other. That is, gcd(key, size of symbol set) == 1.
We can use the gcd() function we wrote earlier to test this. The key 7 works as an affine cipher
key because gcd(7, 26) returns 1. The larger key 8,953,851 will also work because
gcd(8953851, 26) also returns 1. However, the key 8 did not work because gcd(8, 26)
is 2. If the GCD of the key and the symbol set size is not 1, then they are not relatively prime and
the key won’t work.
The math we learned earlier sure is coming in handy now. We need to know how mod works
because it is part of the GCD and affine cipher algorithms. And we need to know how GCD
works because that will tell us if a pair of numbers is relatively prime. And we need to know if a
pair of numbers is relatively prime or not in order to choose valid keys for the affine cipher.
The second problem with affine cipher’s key is discussed in the next chapter.

Decrypting with the Affine Cipher
In the Caesar cipher, we used addition to encrypt and subtraction to decrypt. In the affine cipher,
we use multiplication to encrypt. You might think that we need to divide to decrypt with the
affine cipher. But if you try this yourself, you’ll quickly see that it doesn’t work. To decrypt with
the affine cipher, we need to multiply by the key’s modular inverse.
A modular inverse (which we will call i) of two numbers (which we will call a and m) is such
that (a * i) % m == 1. For example, let’s find the modular inverse of “5 mod 7”. There is
some number i where (5 * i) % 7 will equal “1”. We will have to brute-force this
calculation:



1 isn’t the modular inverse of 5 mod 7, because (5 * 1) % 7 = 5.
2 isn’t the modular inverse of 5 mod 7, because (5 * 2) % 7 = 3.
3 is the modular inverse of 5 mod 7, because (5 * 3) % 7 = 1.

The encryption key and decryption keys for the affine cipher are two different numbers. The
encryption key can be anything we choose as long as it is relatively prime to 26 (which is the size
of our symbol set). If we have chosen the key 7 for encrypting with the affine cipher, the
decryption key will be the modular inverse of 7 mod 26:

3 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 3) % 26 = 21.
4 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 4) % 26 = 2.
5 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 5) % 26 = 9.
6 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 6) % 26 = 16.
7 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 7) % 26 = 23.
8 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 8) % 26 = 4.
9 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 9) % 26 = 11.
10 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 10) % 26 = 18.
11 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 11) % 26 = 25.
12 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 12) % 26 = 6.
13 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 13) % 26 = 13.
14 is not the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 14) % 26 = 20.
15 is the modular inverse of 7 mod 26, because (7 * 15) % 26 = 1.

So the affine cipher decryption key is 15. To decrypt a ciphertext letter, we take that letter’s
number and multiply it by 15, and then mod 26. This will be the number of the original
plaintext’s letter.

Finding Modular Inverses
In order to calculate the modular inverse to get the decryption key, we could take a brute-force
approach and start testing the integer 1, and then 2, and then 3, and so on like we did above. But
this will be very time-consuming for large keys like 8,953,851.
There is an algorithm for finding the modular inverse just like there was for finding the Greatest
Common Divisor. Euclid’s Extended Algorithm can be used to find the modular inverse of a
number:
def findModInverse(a, m):
if gcd(a, m) != 1:
return None # no mod inverse exists if a & m aren't relatively prime
u1, u2, u3 = 1, 0, a
v1, v2, v3 = 0, 1, m
while v3 != 0:
q = u3 // v3 # // is the integer division operator
v1, v2, v3, u1, u2, u3 = (u1 - q * v1), (u2 - q * v2), (u3 - q * v3),
v1, v2, v3
return u1 % m

You don’t have to understand how Euclid’s Extended Algorithm works in order to make use of it.
We’re just going to have our programs call this function. If you’d like to learn more about how it
works, you can read http://invpy.com/euclid.

The // Integer Division Operator
You may have noticed the // operator used in the findModInverse() function above. This
is the integer division operator. It divides two numbers and rounds down. Try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>> 41 // 7
5
>>> 41 / 7
5.857142857142857
>>> 10 // 5
2
>>> 10 / 5
2.0
>>>

Notice that an expression with the // integer division operator always evaluates to an int, not a
float.

Source Code of the cryptomath Module
The gcd() and findModInverse() functions will be used by more than one of our cipher
programs later in this book, so we should put this code into a separate module. In the file editor,

Summary
Since the multiplicative cipher is the same thing as the affine cipher except using Key B of 0, we
won’t have a separate program for the multiplicative cipher. And since it is just a less secure
version of the affine cipher, you shouldn’t use it anyway. The source code to our affine cipher
program will be presented in the next chapter.
The math presented in this chapter isn’t so hard to understand. Modding with the % operator finds
the “remainder” between two numbers. The Greatest Common Divisor function returns the
largest number that can divide two numbers. If the GCD of two numbers is 1, we say that those
numbers are “relatively prime” to each other. The most useful algorithm to find the GCD of two
numbers is Euclid’s Algorithm.

212

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The affine cipher is sort of like the Caesar cipher, except it uses multiplication instead of addition
to encrypt letters. Not all numbers will work as keys though. The key number and the size of the
symbol set must be relatively prime towards each other.
To decrypt with the affine cipher we also use multiplication. To decrypt, the modular inverse of
the key is the number that is multiplied. The modular inverse of “a mod m” is a number i such
that (a * i) % m == 1. To write a function that finds the modular inverse of a number, we
use Euclid’s Extended Algorithm.
Once we understand these math concepts, we can write a program for the affine cipher in the next
chapter.

THE AFFINE CIPHER
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 The Affine Cipher
 Generating random keys
 How many different keys can the affine cipher have?

“I should be able to whisper something in your ear,
even if your ear is 1000 miles away, and the
government disagrees with that.”
Philip Zimmermann, creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), the
most widely used email encryption software in the world.

This chapter’s programs implement the multiplicative and affine ciphers. The multiplicative
cipher is like the Caesar cipher from Chapter 6, except it uses multiplication instead of addition.
The affine cipher is the multiplicative cipher, which is then encrypted by the Caesar cipher on top
of that. The affine cipher needs two keys: one for the multiplicative cipher multiplication and the
other for the Caesar cipher addition.
For the affine cipher program, we will use a single integer for the key. We will use some simple
math to split this key into the two keys, which we will call Key A and Key B.

The sys module is imported for the exit() function.
The pyperclip module is imported for the copy() clipboard function.
The cryptomath module that we created in the last chapter is imported for the gcd()
and findModInverse() function.

In our program, the string stored in the SYMBOLS variable is the symbol set. The symbol set is
the list of all characters that can be encrypted. Any characters in the message to be encrypted that
don’t appear in SYMBOLS will be added to the ciphertext unencrypted.
affineCipher.py

myMessage = """"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it
could deceive a human into believing that it was human." -Alan Turing"""
10.
myKey = 2023
11.
myMode = 'encrypt' # set to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'

The main() function is almost exactly the same as the one from the transposition cipher
programs. The message, key, and mode are stored in variables on lines 9, 10, and 11.

If myMode is set to 'encrypt', then line 14 will be executed and the return value of
encryptMessage() is stored in translated. Or else, if myMode is set to 'decrypt',
then decryptMessage() is called on line 16 and the return value is stored in translated.
Either way, after the execution has passed line 16, the translated variable will have the
encrypted or decrypted version of the message in myMessage.

Splitting One Key into Two Keys
affineCipher.py

24. def getKeyParts(key):
25.
keyA = key // len(SYMBOLS)
26.
keyB = key % len(SYMBOLS)
27.
return (keyA, keyB)

The affine cipher is like the Caesar cipher, except that it uses multiplication and addition (with
two integer keys, which we called Key A and Key B) instead of just addition (with one key). It’s
easier to remember just one number, so we will use a mathematical trick to convert between two
keys and one key.
The getKeyParts() function splits a single integer key into two integers for Key A and Key
B. The single key (which is in the parameter key) is divided by the size of the symbol set, and
Key A is the quotient and Key B is the remainder. The quotient part (without any remainder) can
be calculated using the // integer division operator, which is what line 25 does. The remainder
part (without the quotient) can be calculated using the % mod operator, which is what line 26
does.
It is assumed that the symbol set, as well as the size of the symbol set, is publicly known along
with the rest of the source code.
For example, with 2023 as the key parameter and a SYMBOLS string of 95 characters, Key A
would be 2023 // 95 or 21 and Key B would be 2023 % 95 or 28.
To combine Key A and Key B back into the single key, multiply Key A by the size of the symbol
set and add Key B: (21 * 95) + 28 evaluates to 2023.

The Tuple Data Type
affineCipher.py

27.

return (keyA, keyB)

A tuple value is similar to a list: it is a value that can store other values, which can be accessed
with indexes or slices. However, the values in a tuple cannot be modified. There is no
append() method for tuple values. A tuple is written using parentheses instead of square
brackets. The value returned on line 27 is a tuple.
For technical reasons beyond the scope of this book, the Python interpreter can execute code
faster if it uses tuples compared to code that uses lists.

Input Validation on the Keys
affineCipher.py

30. def checkKeys(keyA, keyB, mode):
31.
if keyA == 1 and mode == 'encrypt':
32.
sys.exit('The affine cipher becomes incredibly weak when key A is
set to 1. Choose a different key.')
33.
if keyB == 0 and mode == 'encrypt':
34.
sys.exit('The affine cipher becomes incredibly weak when key B is
set to 0. Choose a different key.')

Encrypting with the affine cipher involves a character’s index in SYMBOLS being multiplied by
Key A and added to Key B. But if keyA is 1, the encrypted text will be very weak because
multiplying the index by 1 does not change it. Similarly, if keyB is 0, the encrypted text will be
weak because adding the index to 0 does not change it. And if both keyA was 1 and keyB was
0, the “encrypted” message would be the exact same as the original message. It wouldn’t be
encrypted at all!
The if statements on line 31 and 33 check for these “weak key” conditions, and exit the program
with a message telling the user what was wrong. Notice on lines 32 and 34, a string is being
passed to the sys.exit() call. The sys.exit() function has an optional parameter of a
string that will be printed to the screen before terminating the program. This can be used to
display an error message on the screen before the program quits.
Of course, these checks only apply to prevent you from encrypting with weak keys. If mode is set
to 'decrypt', then the checks on lines 31 and 33 don’t apply.
affineCipher.py

35.
if keyA < 0 or keyB < 0 or keyB > len(SYMBOLS) - 1:
36.
sys.exit('Key A must be greater than 0 and Key B must be between 0
and %s.' % (len(SYMBOLS) - 1))

The condition on line 35 checks if keyA is a negative number (that is, it is greater than 0) or if
keyB is greater than 0 or less than the size of the symbol set minus one. (The reason the Key B
check has this range is described later in the “How Many Keys Does the Affine Cipher Have?”
section.) If any of these things are True, the keys are invalid and the program exits.
affineCipher.py

37.
if cryptomath.gcd(keyA, len(SYMBOLS)) != 1:
38.
sys.exit('Key A (%s) and the symbol set size (%s) are not
relatively prime. Choose a different key.' % (keyA, len(SYMBOLS)))

220

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Finally, Key A must be relatively prime with the symbol set size. This means that the greatest
common divisor of keyA and len(SYMBOLS) must be equal to 1. Line 37’s if statement
checks for this and exits the program if they are not relatively prime.
If all of the conditions in the checkKeys() function were False, there is nothing wrong with
the key and the program will not exit. Line 38 is the last line in the function, so the program
execution next returns to the line that originally called checkKeys().

The Affine Cipher Encryption Function
affineCipher.py

41. def encryptMessage(key, message):
42.
keyA, keyB = getKeyParts(key)
43.
checkKeys(keyA, keyB, 'encrypt')

First we get the integer values for Key A and Key B from the getKeyParts() function. These
values are checked if they are valid keys or not by passing them to the checkKeys() function.
If the checkKeys() function does not cause the program to exit, then the rest of the code in the
encryptMessage() function after line 43 can assume that the keys are valid.
affineCipher.py

44.
45.

ciphertext = ''
for symbol in message:

The ciphertext variable will eventually hold the encrypted string, but starts off as a blank
string. The for loop that begins on line 45 will iterate through each of the characters in
message, and then add the encrypted character to ciphertext. By the time the for loop is
done looping, the ciphertext variable will have the complete string of the encrypted message.
affineCipher.py

46.
47.
48.

if symbol in SYMBOLS:
# encrypt this symbol
symIndex = SYMBOLS.find(symbol)
ciphertext += SYMBOLS[(symIndex * keyA + keyB) % len(SYMBOLS)]
else:
ciphertext += symbol # just append this symbol unencrypted

On each iteration of the loop, the symbol variable is assigned the single character from
message. If this character exists in SYMBOLS (that is, our symbol set), then the index in
SYMBOLS is found and assigned to symIndex. The value in symIndex is the “number”
version of the character.

Chapter 15 – The Affine Cipher

221

To encrypt it, we need to calculate the index of the encrypted letter. We multiply this symIndex
by keyA and add keyB, and mod the number by the size of the symbol set (that is, the
expression len(SYMBOLS)). We mod by len(SYMBOLS) because the affine cipher has a
similar “wrap-around” issue that the Caesar cipher had. Modding by len(SYMBOLS) handles
the “wrap-around” by ensuring the calculated index is always between 0 up to (but not including)
len(SYMBOLS). The number that we calculate will be the index in SYMBOLS of the encrypted
character, which is concatenated to the end of the string in ciphertext.
Everything that happens in the above paragraph was done on line 49.
If symbol was not in our symbol set, then symbol is concatenated to the end of the
ciphertext string on line 51.
affineCipher.py

52.

return ciphertext

Once we have iterated through each character in the message string, the ciphertext variable
should contain the full encrypted string. This string is returned from encryptMessage().

The Affine Cipher Decryption Function
affineCipher.py

55. def decryptMessage(key, message):
56.
keyA, keyB = getKeyParts(key)
57.
checkKeys(keyA, keyB, 'decrypt')
58.
plaintext = ''
59.
modInverseOfKeyA = cryptomath.findModInverse(keyA, len(SYMBOLS))

The decryptMessage() function is almost the same as the encryptMessage(). Lines 56
to 58 are equivalent to lines 44 to 46.
However, instead of multiplying by Key A, the decryption process needs to multiply by the
modular inverse of Key A. The mod inverse can be calculated by calling
cryptomath.findModInverse(). This function was explained in the previous chapter.
affineCipher.py

61.
for symbol in message:
62.
if symbol in SYMBOLS:
63.
# decrypt this symbol
64.
symIndex = SYMBOLS.find(symbol)
65.
plaintext += SYMBOLS[(symIndex - keyB) * modInverseOfKeyA %
len(SYMBOLS)]

222

66.
67.
68.

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

else:
plaintext += symbol # just append this symbol undecrypted
return plaintext

Lines 61 to 68 are almost identical to the encryptMessage() function’s lines 45 to 52. The
only difference is on line 65. In the encryptMessage() function, the symbol index was
multiplied by Key A and then had Key B added to it. In decryptMessage()’s line 65, the
symbol index first has Key B subtracted from it, and then is multiplied by the modular inverse.
Then this number is modded by the size of the symbol set, len(SYMBOLS). This is how the
decryption process undoes the encryption.

Generating Random Keys
It can be difficult to come up with a valid key for the affine cipher, so we will create a
getRandomKey() function that generates a random (but valid) key for the user to use. To use
this, the user simply has to change line 10 to store the return value of getRandomKey() in the
myKey variable:
affineCipher.py

10.

myKey = getRandomKey()

Now the key that is used to encrypt is randomly selected for us. It will be printed to the screen

The code in getRandomKey()enters a while loop on line 72 where the condition is True.
This is called an infinite loop, because the loop’s condition is never False. If your program
gets stuck in an infinite loop, you can terminate it by pressing Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D.
The code on lines 73 and 74 determine random numbers between 2 and the size of the symbol set
for keyA and for keyB. This way there is no chance that Key A or Key B are equal to the invalid

The if statement on line 75 checks to make sure that keyA is relatively prime with the size of
the symbol set by calling the gcd() function in the cryptomath module. If it is, then these
two keys are combined into a single key by multiplying keyA by the symbol set size and adding
keyB. (This is the opposite of what the getKeyParts() function does.) This value is returned
from the getRandomKey() function.
If the condition on line 75 was False, then the code loops back to the start of the while loop
on line 73 and picks random numbers for keyA and keyB again. The infinite loop ensures that
the program keeps looping again and again until it finds random numbers that are valid keys.

Lines 81 and 82 call the main() function if this program was run by itself, rather than imported
by another program.

The Second Affine Key Problem: How Many Keys Can the Affine
Cipher Have?
Key B of the affine cipher is limited to the size of the symbol set (in the case of affineCipher.py,
len(SYMBOLS) is 95). But it seems like Key A could be as large as we want it to be (as long as
it is relatively prime to the symbol set size). Therefore the affine cipher should have an infinite
number of keys and therefore cannot be brute-forced.
As it turns out, no. Remember how large keys in the Caesar cipher ended up being the same as
smaller keys due to the “wrap-around” effect. With a symbol set size of 26, the key 27 in the
Caesar cipher would produce the same encrypted text as the key 1. The affine cipher also “wraps
around”.
Since the Key B part of the affine cipher is the same as the Caesar cipher, we know it is limited
from 1 to the size of the symbol set. But to find out if the affine cipher’s Key A is also limited, we
can write a small program to encrypt a message with several different integers for Key A and see
what the ciphertext looks like.

# This program proves that the keyspace of the affine cipher is limited
# to len(SYMBOLS) ^ 2.
import affineCipher, cryptomath
message = 'Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.'
for keyA in range(2, 100):
key = keyA * len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS) + 1
if cryptomath.gcd(keyA, len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS)) == 1:
print(keyA, affineCipher.encryptMessage(key, message))

This is a fairly simple program. It imports the affineCipher module for its
encryptMessage() function and the cryptomath module for its gcd() function. We will
always encrypt the string stored in the message variable. The for loop will range between 2
(since 0 and 1 are not allowed as valid Key A integers) and 100.
On each iteration of the loop, we calculate the key from the current keyA value and always use 1
for Key B (this is why 1 is added on line 8). Remember that it is not valid to use a Key A that is
not relatively prime with the symbol set size. So if the greatest common divisor of the key and the
symbol set size is not equal to 1, the if statement on line 10 will skip the call to
encryptMessage() on line 11.
Basically, this program will print out the same message encrypted with several different integers
for Key A. The output of this program will look like this:

225

Look carefully at the output. You’ll notice that the ciphertext for Key A of 2 is the exact same as
the ciphertext for Key A of 97! In fact, the ciphertext from keys 3 and 98 are the same, as are the
ciphertext from keys 4 and 99!
Notice that 97 - 95 is 2. This is why a Key A of 97 does the same thing as a Key A of 2: the
encrypted output repeats itself (that is, “wraps around”) every 95 keys. The affine cipher has the
same “wrap-around” for the Key A as it does for Key B! It seems like it is limited to the symbol
set size.
95 possible Key A keys multiplied by 95 possible Key B keys means there are 9,025 possible
combinations. If you subtract the integers that can’t be used for Key A (because they are not
relatively prime with 95), this number drops to 7,125 possible keys.

Summary
7,125 is about the same number of keys that’s possible with most transposition cipher messages,
and we’ve already learned how to program a computer to hack that number of keys with bruteforce. This means that we’ll have to toss the affine cipher onto the heap of weak ciphers that are
easily hacked.
The affine cipher isn’t any more secure than the previous ciphers we’ve looked at. The
transposition cipher can have more possible keys, but the number of possible keys is limited to
the size of the message. For a message with only 20 characters, the transposition cipher can only
have at most 18 keys (the keys 2 to 19). The affine cipher can be used to encrypt short messages
with more security than the Caesar cipher provided, since its number of possible keys is based on
the symbol set.
But we did learn some new mathematical concepts that we will use later on. The concepts of
modular arithmetic, greatest common divisor, and modular inverses will help us in the RSA
cipher at the end of this book.
But enough about how the affine cipher is weak in theory. Let’s write a brute-force program that
can actually break affine cipher encrypted messages!

6. SILENT_MODE = False

Our affine cipher hacking program fits in 60 lines of code because we’ve already written much of
the code it uses.
When you run the hacker program, you can see that this program produces a lot of output as it
works its way through all the possible decryptions. However, printing out this input does slow
down the program. If you change line 6 to set the SILENT_MODE variable to True, the program
will be silenced and not print out all these messages. This will speed up the program immensely.
But showing all that text while your hacking program runs makes it look cool. (And if you want
your programs to look cool by printing out text slowly one character at a time for a “typewriter”
effect, check out the typewriter.py module at http://invpy.com/typewriter.py.)

else:
22.
print('Failed to hack encryption.')

The ciphertext to be hacked is stored as a string in myMessage, and this string is passed to the
hackAffine() function (described next). The return value from this call is either a string of
the original message (if the ciphertext was hacked) or the None value (if the hacking failed).
The code on lines 15 to 22 will check if hackedMessage was set to None or not. If
hackedMessage is not equal to None, then the message will be printed to the screen on line
19 and copied to the clipboard on line 20. Otherwise, the program will simply print that it was
unable to hack the message.

# Python programs can be stopped at any time by pressing Ctrl-C (on

# Windows) or Ctrl-D (on Mac and Linux)
30.
print('(Press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D to quit at any time.)')

The hackAffine() function has the code that does the decryption. This can take a while, so if
the user wants to exit the program early, she can press Ctrl-C (on Windows) or Ctrl-D (on OS X
and Linux).

The ** Exponent Operator
There is another math operator besides the basic +, -, *, /, and // operators. The ** operator is
Python’s exponent operator. This does “to the power of” math on two numbers. For example,
“two to the power of five” would be 2 ** 5 in Python code. This is equivalent to two
multiplied by itself five times: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2. Both the expressions 2 ** 5 and 2 *
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 evaluate to the integer 32.

# brute-force by looping through every possible key
for key in range(len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS) ** 2):
keyA = affineCipher.getKeyParts(key)[0]

The range of integers for the keys used to brute-force the ciphertext will range from 0 to the size
of the symbol set to the second power. The expression:
len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS) ** 2

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 16 – Hacking the Affine Cipher

231

...is the same as:
len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS) * len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS)
We multiply this because there are at most len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS) possible integers
for Key A and len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS) possible integers for Key B. To get the
entire range of possible keys, we multiply these values together.
Line 34 calls the getKeyParts() function that we made in affineCipher.py to get the Key A
part of the key we are testing. Remember that the return value of this function call is a tuple of
two integers (one for Key A and one for Key B). Since hackAffine() only needs Key A, the
[0] after the function call works on the return value to evaluate to just the first integer in the
returned tuple.
That is, affineCipher.getKeyParts(key)[0] will evaluate to (for example), the tuple
(42, 22)[0], which will then evaluate to 42. This is how we can get just the Key A part of
the return value. The Key B part (that is, the second value in the returned tuple) is just ignored
because we don’t need Key B to calculate if Key A is valid.

The continue Statement
The continue statement is simply the continue keyword by itself. A continue statement
is found inside the block of a while or for loop. When a continue statement is executed, the
program execution immediately jumps to the start of the loop for the next iteration.
This is exactly the same thing that happens when the program execution reaches the end of the
loop’s block. But a continue statement makes the program execution jump back to the start of
the loop early.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> for i in range(3):
...
print(i)
...
print('Hello!')
...
0
Hello!
1
Hello!
2
Hello!
>>>

232

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

This is pretty obvious. The for loop will loop through the range object, and the value in i
becomes each integer between 0 and 4. Also on each iteration, the print('Hello!')
function call will display “Hello!” on the screen.
Try typing in this code, which adds a continue statement before the print('Hello!')
line:
>>> for i in range(3):
...
print(i)
...
continue
...
print('Hello!')
...
0
1
2
>>>

Notice that “Hello!” never appears, because the continue statement causes the program
execution to jump back to the start of the for loop for the next iteration. So the execution never
reaches the print('Hello!') line.
A continue statement is often put inside an if statement’s block so that execution will
continue at the beginning of the loop based on some condition.
affineHacker.py

36.

if cryptomath.gcd(keyA, len(affineCipher.SYMBOLS)) != 1:
continue

With the Key A integer stored in the variable keyA, line 35 uses the gcd() function in our
cryptomath module to determine if Key A is not relatively prime with the symbol set size.
Remember, two numbers are relatively prime if their GCD (greatest common divisor) is one.
If Key A and the symbol set size are not relatively prime, then the condition on line 35 is True
and the continue statement on line 36 is executed. This will cause the program execution to
jump back to the start of the loop for the next iteration. This way, the program will skip line 38’s
call to decryptMessage() if the key is invalid, and continue to the next key.

The message is then decrypted with the key by calling decryptMessage(). If
SILENT_MODE is False the “Tried Key” message will be printed on the screen. If
SILENT_MODE was set to True, the print() call on line 40 will be skipped.

Next, we use the isEnglish() function from our detectEnglish module to check if the
decrypted message is recognized as English. If the wrong decryption key was used, then the
decrypted message will look like random characters and isEnglish() will return False.
But if the decrypted message is recognized as readable English (by the isEnglish() function
anyway), then we will display this to the user.

set to the string '__main__' (instead of 'affineHacker'). In this case, we want to call the
main() function.

Summary
This chapter was fairly short because it hasn’t introduced any new hacking techniques. As long as
the number of possible keys is less than a million or so, it won’t take long for our computers to
brute-force through every possible key and use isEnglish() to check if it has found the right
key.
And a lot of the code we use for the affine cipher hacker has already been written in
affineCipher.py, detectEnglish.py, cryptomath.py, and pyperclip.py. The main() function trick
is really helpful in making the code in our programs reusable.
The ** exponent operator can be used to raise a number to the power of another number. The
continue statement sends the program execution back to the beginning of the loop (instead of
waiting until the execution reaches the end of the block).
In the next chapter, we will learn a new cipher that cannot be brute-forced by our computers. The
number of possible keys is more than a trillion trillion! A single laptop couldn’t possible go
through a fraction of those keys in our life time. This makes it immune to brute-forcing. Let’s
learn about the simple substitution cipher.

The transposition and affine ciphers have thousands of possible keys, but a computer can still
brute-force through all of them easily. We’ll need a cipher that has so many possible keys, no
computer can possibly brute-force through them all.
The simple substitution cipher is effectively invulnerable to a brute-force attack. Even if your
computer could try out a trillion keys every second, it would still take twelve million years for it
to try out every key.

The Simple Substitution Cipher with Paper and Pencil
To implement the simple substitution cipher, choose a random letter to encrypt each letter of the
alphabet. Use each letter once and only once. The key will end up being a string of 26 letters of
the alphabet in random order. There are 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible orderings
for keys. (To see how this number was calculated, see http://invpy.com/factorial).
Let’s do the simple substitution cipher with paper and pencil first. For example, let’s encrypt the
message, “Attack at dawn.” with the key VJZBGNFEPLITMXDWKQUCRYAHSO. First write
out the letters of the alphabet and then write the key underneath it.
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕ ↕
V J Z B G N F E P L I T M X D W K Q U C R Y A H S O
To encrypt a message, find the letter from the plaintext in the top row and substitute it with the
letter in the bottom row. A encrypts to V, and T encrypts to C, C encrypts to Z, and so on. So the
message “Attack at dawn.” encrypts to “Vccvzi vc bvax.”
To decrypt, find the letter from the ciphertext in the bottom row and replace it with the letter from
the top row. V decrypts to A, C decrypts to T, Z decrypts to C, and so on.
This is very similar to how the Caesar cipher works with the St. Cyr slide, except the bottom row
is scrambled instead of in alphabetical order and just shifted over. The advantage of the simple
substitution cipher is that there are far more possible keys. The disadvantage is that the key is 26
characters long and harder to memorize. If you write down the key, make sure that this key is
never read by anyone else!

Sample Run of the Simple Substitution Cipher Program
When you run this program, the output will look like this:
Using key LFWOAYUISVKMNXPBDCRJTQEGHZ
The encrypted message is:

This message has been copied to the clipboard.

Notice that if the letter in the plaintext was lowercase, it will be lowercase in the ciphertext. If the
letter was uppercase in the plaintext, it will be uppercase in the ciphertext. The simple
substitution cipher does not encrypt spaces or punctuation marks. (Although the end of this
chapter explains how to modify the program to encrypt those characters too.)
To decrypt this ciphertext, paste it as the value for the myMessage variable on line 10 and
change myMode to the string 'decrypt'. Then run the program again. The output will look
like this:
Using key LFWOAYUISVKMNXPBDCRJTQEGHZ
The decrypted message is:
If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize
it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe
it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for
acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest
evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this way. -Bertrand Russell

# Simple Substitution Cipher
# http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed)
import pyperclip, sys, random

LETTERS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

240

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The first few lines are comments describing the program. Then the pyperclip, sys, and
random modules are imported. Finally, the LETTERS constant variable is set to a string of all
the uppercase letters. The LETTERS string will be our symbol set for the simple substitution
cipher program.

The Program’s main() Function
simpleSubCipher.py

9. def main():
10.
myMessage = 'If a man is offered a fact which goes against his
instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is
overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is
offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his

myths is explained in this way. -Bertrand Russell'
11.
myKey = 'LFWOAYUISVKMNXPBDCRJTQEGHZ'
12.
myMode = 'encrypt' # set to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'

The main() function is similar to the main() function of cipher programs in the previous
chapters. It contains the variables that store the message, key, and mode that will be used for
the program.
simpleSubCipher.py

14.

checkValidKey(myKey)

The keys for simple substitution ciphers are easy to get wrong. For example, the key might not
have every letter of the alphabet. Or the key may have the same letter twice. The
checkValidKey() function (which is explained later) makes sure the key is usable by the
encryption and decryption functions, and will exit the program with an error message if they are
not.
simpleSubCipher.py

17.
18.
19.

if myMode == 'encrypt':
translated = encryptMessage(myKey, myMessage)
elif myMode == 'decrypt':
translated = decryptMessage(myKey, myMessage)

If the program execution returns from checkValidKey() instead of terminating, we can
assume the key is valid. Lines 16 through 19 check whether the myMode variable is set to
'encrypt' or 'decrypt' and calls either encryptMessage() or
decryptMessage(). The return value of encryptMessage() and decryptMessage()

(which is explained later) will be a string of the encrypted (or decrypted) message. This string
will be stored in the translated variable.
simpleSubCipher.py

print('Using key %s' % (myKey))
print('The %sed message is:' % (myMode))
print(translated)
pyperclip.copy(translated)
print()
print('This message has been copied to the clipboard.')

The key that was used is printed to the screen on line 20. The encrypted (or decrypted) message is
printed on the screen and also copied to the clipboard. Line 25 is the last line of code in the
main() function, so the program execution returns after line 25. Since the main() call is done
at the last line of the program, the program will then exit.

The sort() List Method
simpleSubCipher.py

28. def checkValidKey(key):
29.
keyList = list(key)
30.
lettersList = list(LETTERS)
31.
keyList.sort()
32.
lettersList.sort()

A simple substitution key string value is only valid if it has each of the characters in the symbol
set with no duplicate or missing letters. We can check if a string value is a valid key by sorting it
and the symbol set into alphabetical order and checking if they are equal. (Although LETTERS is
already in alphabetical order, we still need to sort it since it could be expanded to contain other
characters.)
On line 29 the string in key is passed to list(). The list value returned is stored in a variable
named keyList. On line 30, the LETTERS constant variable (which, remember, is the string
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') is passed to list() which returns the list ['A',
'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N',
'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'].
The sort() list method will rearrange the order of items in the list into alphabetical order. The
lists in keyList and lettersList are then sorted in alphabetical order by calling the
sort() list method on them. Note that just like the append() list method, the sort() list
method modifies the list in place and does not have a return value. You want your code to look
like this:

242

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

keyList.sort()

...and not look like this:
keyList = keyList.sort()
simpleSubCipher.py

33.
34.

if keyList != lettersList:
sys.exit('There is an error in the key or symbol set.')

Once sorted, the keyList and lettersList values should be the same, since keyList was
just the characters in LETTERS with the order scrambled. If keyList and lettersList are
equal, we also know that keyList (and, therefore, the key parameter) does not have any
duplicates in it, since LETTERS does not have any duplicates in it.
However, if the condition on line 33 is True, then the value in myKey was set to an invalid
value and the program will exit by calling sys.exit().

Wrapper Functions
simpleSubCipher.py

37. def encryptMessage(key, message):
38.
return translateMessage(key, message, 'encrypt')
39.
40.
41. def decryptMessage(key, message):
42.
return translateMessage(key, message, 'decrypt')
43.
44.
45. def translateMessage(key, message, mode):

The code for encrypting and the code for decrypting are almost exactly the same. It’s always a
good idea to put code into a function and call it twice rather than type out the code twice. First,
this saves you some typing. But second, if there’s ever a bug in the duplicate code, you only have
to fix the bug in one place instead of multiple places. It is (usually) much more reasonable to
replace duplicate code with a single function that has the code.

Wrapper functions simply wrap the code of another function, and return the value the wrapped
function returns. Often the wrapper function might make a slight change to the arguments or
return value of wrapped function (otherwise you would just call the wrapped function directly.) In
this case, encryptMessage() and decryptMessage() (the wrapper functions) calls

Chapter 17 – The Simple Substitution Cipher

243

translateMessage() (the wrapped function) and returns the value
translateMessage() returns.
On line 45 notice that translateMessage() has the parameters key and message, but also
a third parameter named mode. When it calls translateMessage(), the call in
encryptMessage() function passes 'encrypt' for the mode parameter, and the call in
decryptMessage() function passes 'decrypt'. This is how the
translateMessage() function knows whether it should encrypt or decrypt the message it is
passed.
With these wrapper functions, someone who imports the simpleSubCipher.py program can call
functions named encryptMessage() and decryptMessage() like they do with all the
other cipher programs in this book. They might create a program that encrypts with various
ciphers, like below:
import affineCipher, simpleSubCipher, transpositionCipher
...some other code here...
ciphertext1 =
affineCipher.encryptMessage(encKey1, 'Hello!')
ciphertext2 = transpositionCipher.encryptMessage(encKey2, 'Hello!')
ciphertext3 =
simpleSubCipher.encryptMessage(encKey3, 'Hello!')

The wrapper functions give the simple substitution cipher program function names that are
consistent with the other cipher programs. Consistent names are very helpful, because it makes it
easier for someone familiar with one of the cipher programs in this book to already be familiar
with the other cipher programs. (You can even see that the first parameter was always made the
key and the second parameter is always the message.) This is the reason we have these wrapper
functions, because making the programmer call the translateMessage() function would be
inconsistent with the other programs.

The Program’s translateMessage() Function
simpleSubCipher.py

45. def translateMessage(key, message, mode):
46.
translated = ''
47.
charsA = LETTERS
48.
charsB = key
49.
if mode == 'decrypt':
50.
# For decrypting, we can use the same code as encrypting. We
51.
# just need to swap where the key and LETTERS strings are used.
52.
charsA, charsB = charsB, charsA

244

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The translateMessage() function does the encryption (or decryption, if the mode
parameter is set to the string 'decrypt'). The encryption process is very simple: for each letter
in the message parameter, we look up its index in LETTERS and replace it with the letter at that
same index in the key parameter. To decrypt we do the opposite: we look up the index in key
and replace it with the letter at the same index in the LETTERS.
The table below shows why using the same index will encrypt or decrypt the letter. The top row
shows the characters in charsA (which is set to LETTERS on line 47), the middle row shows
the characters in charsB (which is set to key on line 48), and the bottom row are the integer
indexes (for our own reference in this example).
A B C D E F G H

X D W K Q U C R Y A H S O
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
The code in translateMessage() will always look up the message character’s index in
charsA and replace it with the character at that index in charsB.
So to encrypt, we can just leave charsA and charsB as they are. This will replace the character
in LETTERS with the character in key, because charsA is set to LETTERS and charsB is set
to key.
When decrypting, the values in charsA and charsB (that is, LETTERS and key) are swapped
on line 52, so the table would look like this:
V J Z B G N F E

Remember, our code in translateMessage() always replaces the character in charsA (the
top row) with the character at that same index in charsB (the middle row). So when lines 47 and
48 will swap the values in charsA and charsB, the code in translateMessage() will be
doing the decryption process instead of the encryption process.
simpleSubCipher.py

58.

# loop through each symbol in the message
for symbol in message:
if symbol.upper() in charsA:
# encrypt/decrypt the symbol
symIndex = charsA.find(symbol.upper())

The for loop on line 55 will set the symbol variable to a character in the message string on
each iteration through the loop. If the uppercase form of this symbol exists in charsA
(remember that both the key and LETTERS only have uppercase characters in them), then we
will find the index of the uppercase form of symbol in charsA. This index will be stored in a
variable named symIndex.
We already know that the find() method will never return -1 (remember, a -1 from the
find() method means the argument could not be found the string) because the if statement on
line 56 guarantees that symbol.upper() will exist in charsA. Otherwise line 58 wouldn’t
have been executed in the first place.

The isupper() and islower() String Methods
The isupper() string method returns True if:
1. The string has at least one uppercase letter.
2. The string does not have any lowercase letters in it.
The islower() string method returns True if:
1. The string has at least one lowercase letter.
2. The string does not have any uppercase letters in it.
Non-letter characters in the string do not affect whether these methods return True or False.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'HELLO'.isupper()
True

246

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

>>> 'HELLO WORLD 123'.isupper()
True
>>> 'hELLO'.isupper()
False
>>> 'hELLO'.islower()
False
>>> 'hello'.islower()
True
>>> '123'.isupper()
False
>>> ''.islower()
False

59.
60.
61.
62.

if symbol.isupper():
translated += charsB[symIndex].upper()
else:
translated += charsB[symIndex].lower()

If symbol is an uppercase letter, than we want to concatenate the uppercase version of the
character at charsB[symIndex] to translated. Otherwise we will concatenate the
lowercase version of the character at charsB[symIndex] to translated.
If symbol was a number or punctuation mark like '5' or '?', then the condition on line 59
would be False (since those strings don’t have at least one uppercase letter in them) and line 62
would have been executed. In this case, line 62’s lower() method call would have no effect on
the string since it has no letters in it. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> '5'.lower()
'5'
>>> '?'.lower()
'?'
>>>

So line 62 in the else block takes care of translating any lowercase characters and non-letter
characters.

By looking at the indentation, you can tell that the else statement on line 63 is paired with the
if statement on line 56. The code in the block that follows (that is, line 65) is executed if
symbol is not in LETTERS. This means that we cannot encrypt (or decrypt) the character in
symbol, so we will just concatenate it to the end of translated as is.

return translated

At the end of the translateMessage() function we return the value in the translated
variable, which will contain the encrypted or decrypted message.

Generating a Random Key
simpleSubCipher.py

70. def getRandomKey():
71.
key = list(LETTERS)
72.
random.shuffle(key)
73.
return ''.join(key)

Typing up a string that contains each letter of the alphabet once and only once can be difficult. To
aid the user, the getRandomKey() function will return a valid key to use. Lines 71 to 73 do
this by randomly scrambling the characters in the LETTERS constant. See the “Randomly
Scrambling a String” section in Chapter 10 for an explanation of how to scramble a string using
list(), random.shuffle(), and join().
To use the getRandomKey() function, line 11 can be changed to this:
11.

myKey = getRandomKey()

Remember that our cipher program will print out the key being used on line 20. This is how the
user can find out what key the getRandomKey() function returned.
simpleSubCipher.py

76. if __name__ == '__main__':
77.
main()

248

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Lines 76 and 77 are at the bottom of the program, and call main() if simpleSubCipher.py is
being run as a program instead of imported as a module by another program.

Encrypting Spaces and Punctuation
The simple substitution cipher in this chapter only encrypts the letters in the plaintext. This
artificial limitation is here because the hacking program in the next chapter only works if the
letters alone have been substituted.
If you want the simple substitution program to encrypt more than just the letter characters, make
the following changes:
simpleSubCipher.py

7. LETTERS = r""" !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY
Z[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~"""

Line 7’s value stored in the LETTERS constant is changed to a string of all the characters Using a
triple-quotes raw string so you do not have to escape the quotes and \ slash character makes
typing this easier.
The key used must also have all of these characters, so line 11 changes to something like this:
simpleSubCipher.py

11.
myKey = r"""/{9@6hUf:q?_)^eTi|W1,NLD7xk(SF>Iz0E=d;Bu#c]w~'VvHKmpJ+}s8y& XtP43.b[OA!*\Q<M%$ZgG52YloaRCn"`rj"""

The code that differentiates between upper and lowercase letters on lines 58 to 62 can be replaced
with these two lines:
simpleSubCipher.py

58.
59.
60.
61.
62.

symIndex = charsA.find(symbol.upper())
if symbol.isupper():
translated += charsB[symIndex].upper()
else:
translated += charsB[symIndex].lower()

58.
59.

symIndex = charsA.find(symbol)
translated += charsB[symIndex]

Now when you run the simple substitution cipher program, the ciphertext looks much more like
random gibberish:

Summary
In this chapter, we have learned about the new “set” data type. In many of our programs, lists are
much easier to use than sets, but sets are a simple way to get rid of duplicate values from lists or
strings.
The isupper() and islower() string methods can tell us if a string value is made up of only
uppercase or lowercase letters. And the sort() list method is very useful at putting the items in
a list in order.
The simple substitution cipher has far too many possible keys to brute-force through. This makes
it impervious to the techniques that our previous cipher hacking programs have used. We are
going to have to make smarter programs in order to break this code.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to hack the simple substitution cipher. Instead of bruteforcing through all the keys, we will use a much more intelligent and sophisticated algorithm.

Computing Word Patterns
There are too many possible keys to brute-force a simple substitution cipher-encrypted message.
We need to employ a more intelligent attack if we want to crack a substitution ciphertext. Let’s
examine one possible word from an example ciphertext:
HGHHU
Think about what we can learn from this one word of ciphertext (which we will call a
cipherword in this book). We can tell that whatever the original plaintext word is, it must:
1. Be five letters long.
2. Have the first, third, and fourth letters be the same.
3. Have exactly three different letters in the word, where the first, second, and fifth letters in
the word are all different from each other.
What words in the English language fit this pattern? “Puppy” is one word that fits this pattern. It
is five letters long (P, U, P, P, Y) using three different letters (P, U, Y) in that same pattern (P for
the first, third, and fourth letter and U for the second letter and Y for the fifth letter). “Mommy”,
“Bobby”, “lulls”, “nanny”, and “lilly” fit the pattern too. (“Lilly” is a name, not to be confused
with “Lily” the flower. But since “Lilly” can appear in an Engish message it is a possible word
that fits the pattern.) If we had a lot of time on our hands, we could go through an entire
dictionary and find all the words that fit this pattern. Even better, we could have a computer go
through a dictionary file for us.
In this book a word pattern will be a set of numbers with periods in between the numbers that
tells us the pattern of letters for a word, in either ciphertext or plaintext.
Creating word patterns for cipherwords is easy: the first letter gets the number 0 and the first
occurrence of each different letter after that gets the next number. For example:






The word pattern for “cat” is 0.1.2.
The word pattern for “catty” is 0.1.2.2.3.
The word pattern for “roofer” is 0.1.1.2.3.0.
The word pattern for “blimp” is 0.1.2.3.4.
The word pattern for “classification” is 0.1.2.3.3.4.5.4.0.2.6.4.7.8.

A plaintext word and its cipherword will always have the same word pattern, no matter
which simple substitution key was used to do the encryption.

Getting a List of Candidates for a Cipherword
To take a guess at what HGHHU could decrypt to, we can go through the dictionary file and find
all of the words that also have a word pattern of 0.1.0.0.2. In this book, we will call these
plaintext words (that have the same word pattern as the cipherword) the candidates for that
cipherword:
Ciphertext word:

H G H H U

Word pattern:
Candidates:

0.1.0.0.2
p u p p y
m o m m y
b o b b y
l u l l s
n a n n y
l i l l y

So if we look at the letters in the cipherword (which will be called cipherletters in this book),
we can guess which letters they may decrypt to (we will call these letters the cipherletter’s
potential decryption letters in this book):
Cipherletters: H
Potential decryption letters: p
m
b
l
n
l

G
u
o
o
u
a
i

U
y
y
y
s
y
y

From this table we can create a cipherletter mapping:





The cipher letter H has the potential decryption letters P, M, B, L, and N
The cipher letter G has the potential decryption letters U, O, A, and I
The cipher letter U has the potential decryption letters Y and S
All of the other cipher letters besides H, G, and U will have no potential decryption letters.

When we represent a cipherletter mapping in Python code, we will use a dictionary value:

253

{'A': [], 'B': [], 'C': [], 'D': [], 'E': [], 'F': [], 'G': ['U', 'O', 'A',
'I'], 'H': ['P', 'B', 'L', 'N'], 'I': [], 'J': [], 'K': [], 'L': [], 'M': [],
'N': [], 'O': [], 'P': [], 'Q': [], 'R': [], 'S': [], 'T': [], 'U': ['Y', 'S'],
'V': [], 'W': [], 'X': [], 'Y': [], 'Z': []}

In our program, a cipherletter mapping dictionary will have 26 keys, one for each letter. The
mapping above has potential decryption letters for 'H', 'G', and 'U' above. The other keys
have no potential decryption letters, which is why they have empty lists for values.
If we reduce the number of potential decryption letters for a cipherletter to just one letter, then we
have solved what that cipherletter decrypts to. Even if we do not solve all 26 cipherletters, we
might be able to hack most of the ciphertext’s cipherletters.
But first we must find the pattern for every word in the dictionary file and sort them in a list so it
will be easy to get a list of all the candidates for a given cipherword’s word pattern. We can use
the same dictionary file from Chapter 12, which you can download from
http://invpy.com/dictionary.txt.
(Note that the terms “word pattern”, “candidate”, and “cipherletter mapping” are terms I came up
with to describe things in this particular hacking program. These are not general cryptography
terms.)

Source Code of the Word Pattern Module
Since the word patterns for words never change, we can just calculate the word pattern for every
word in a dictionary file once and store them in another file. Our makeWordPatterns.py program
creates a file named wordPatterns.py that will contain a dictionary value with the word pattern for
every word in the dictionary file. Our hacking program can then just import wordPatterns to
look up the candidates for a certain word pattern.

Sample Run of the Word Pattern Module
Running this program doesn’t print anything out to the screen. Instead it silently creates a file
named wordPatterns.py in the same folder as makeWordPatterns.py. Open this file in IDLE’s file
editor, and you will see it looks like this:
allPatterns = {'0.0.1': ['EEL'],
'0.0.1.2': ['EELS', 'OOZE'],
'0.0.1.2.0': ['EERIE'],
'0.0.1.2.3': ['AARON', 'LLOYD', 'OOZED'],
...the rest has been cut for brevity...

The makeWordPatterns.py program creates wordPatterns.py. Our Python program creates a
Python program! The entire wordPatterns.py program is just one (very big) assignment statement
for a variable named allPatterns. Even though this assignment statement stretches over
many lines in the file, it is considered one “line of code” because Python knows that if a line ends
with a comma but it is currently in the middle of a dictionary value, it ignores the indentation of
the next line and just considers it part of the previous line. (This is a rare exception for Python’s
significant indentation rules.)
The allPatterns variable contains a dictionary value where the keys are all the word patterns
made from the English words in the dictionary file. The keys’ values are lists of strings of English
words with that pattern. When wordPatterns.py is imported as a module, our program will be able
to look up all the English words for any given word pattern.
After running the makeWordPatterns.py program to create the wordPatterns.py file, try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>> import wordPatterns
>>> wordPatterns.allPatterns['0.1.2.1.1.3.4']
['BAZAARS', 'BESEECH', 'REDEEMS', 'STUTTER']
>>>
>>> wordPatterns.allPatterns['0.1.2.2.3.2.4.1.5.5']
['CANNONBALL']
>>>
>>> wordPatterns.allPatterns['0.1.0.1.0.1']
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: '0.1.0.1.0.1'
>>>
>>> '0.1.0.1.0.1' in wordPatterns.allPatterns
False
>>>

256

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The pattern '0.1.0.1.0.1' does not exist in the dictionary. This is why the expression
wordPatterns.allPatterns['0.1.0.1.0.1'] causes an error (because there is no
'0.1.0.1.0.1' key in allPatterns) and why '0.1.0.1.0.1' in
wordPatterns.allPatterns evaluates to False.

The pprint.pprint() and pprint.pformat() Functions
makeWordPatterns.py

8. import pprint

The pprint module has functions for pretty printing values, which is useful for printing
dictionary and list values on the screen. The print() function simply prints these values going
left to right:
>>> print(someListOfListsVar))
[['ant'], ['baboon', 'badger', 'bat', 'bear', 'beaver'], ['camel', 'cat',
'clam', 'cobra', 'cougar', 'coyote', 'crow'], ['deer', 'dog', 'donkey',
'duck'], ['eagle'], ['ferret', 'fox', 'frog'], ['goat']]

The pprint module has a function named pprint(). The value passed to
pprint.pprint() will be “pretty printed” to the screen so that it is easier to read:
>>> import pprint
>>> pprint.pprint(someListOfListsVar))
[['ant'],
['baboon', 'badger', 'bat', 'bear', 'beaver'],
['camel', 'cat', 'clam', 'cobra', 'cougar', 'coyote', 'crow'],
['deer', 'dog', 'donkey', 'duck'],
['eagle'],
['ferret', 'fox', 'frog'],
['goat']]

257

However, if you want to have this “prettified” text as a string value instead of displaying it on the
screen, you can use the pprint.pformat() function, which returns the prettified string:
>>> import pprint
>>> prettifiedString = pprint.pformat(someListOfListsVar)
>>> print(prettifiedString)
[['ant'],
['baboon', 'badger', 'bat', 'bear', 'beaver'],
['camel', 'cat', 'clam', 'cobra', 'cougar', 'coyote', 'crow'],
['deer', 'dog', 'donkey', 'duck'],
['eagle'],
['ferret', 'fox', 'frog'],
['goat']]
>>>

When we write the value of allPatterns to the wordPatterns.py file, we will use the
pprint module to prevent it from being printed crammed together all on one line.

Building Strings in Python with Lists
Almost all of our programs have done some form of “building a string” code. That is, a variable
will start as a blank string and then new characters are added with string concatenation. (We’ve
done this in many previous cipher programs with the translated variable.) This is usually
done with the + operator to do string concatenation, as in the following short program:
# The slow way to build a string using string concatenation.
building = ''
for c in 'Hello world!':
building += c
print(building)

The above program loops through each character in the string 'Hello world!' and
concatenates it to the end of the string stored in building. At the end of the loop, building
holds the complete string.
This seems like a straightforward way to do this. However, it is very inefficient for Python to
concatenate strings. The reasons are technical and beyond the scope of this book, but it is much
faster to start with a blank list instead of a blank string, and then use the append() list
method instead of string concatenation. After you are done building the list of strings, you can
convert the list of strings to a single string value with the join() method. The following short
program does exactly the same thing as the previous example, but faster:

258

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

# The fast way to build a string using a list, append(), and join().
building = []
for c in 'Hello world!':
building.append(c)
building = ''.join(building)
print(building)

Using this approach for building up strings in your code will result in much faster programs. We
will be using this list-append-join process to build strings in the remaining programs of this book.

Calculating the Word Pattern
makeWordPatterns.py

11. def getWordPattern(word):
12.
# Returns a string of the pattern form of the given word.
13.
# e.g. '0.1.2.3.4.1.2.3.5.6' for 'DUSTBUSTER'
14.
word = word.upper()
15.
nextNum = 0
16.
letterNums = {}
17.
wordPattern = []

The getWordPattern() function takes one string argument and returns a string of that
word’s pattern. For example, if getWordPattern() were passed the string 'Buffoon' as
an argument then getWordPattern() would return the string '0.1.2.2.3.3.4'.
First, in order to make sure all the letters have the same case, line 14 changes the word parameter
to an uppercase version of itself. We then need three variables:





nextNum stores the next number used when a new letter is found.
letterNums stores a dictionary with keys of single-letter strings of single letters, and
values of the integer number for that letter. As we find new letters in the word, the letter and
its number are stored in letterNums.
wordPattern will be the string that is returned from this function. But we will be building
this string one character at a time, so we will use the list-append-join process to do this. This
is why wordPattern starts as a blank list instead of a blank string.

for letter in word:
if letter not in letterNums:
letterNums[letter] = str(nextNum)
nextNum += 1

makeWordPatterns.py

Chapter 18 – Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher

259

Line 19’s for loop will loop through each character in the word parameter, assigning each
character to a variable named letter.
Line 20 checks if letter has not been seen before by checking that letter does not exist as a
key in the letterNums dictionary. (On the first iteration of the loop, the condition on line 20
will always be True because letterNums will be a blank dictionary that doesn’t have
anything in it.)
If we have not seen this letter before, line 21 adds this letter as the key and the string form of
nextNum as the key’s value to the letterNums dictionary. For the next new letter we find we
want to use the next integer after the one currently in nextNum anymore, so line 22 increments
the integer in nextNum by 1.
makeWordPatterns.py

23.

wordPattern.append(letterNums[letter])

On line 23, letterNums[letter] evaluates to the integer used for the letter in the letter
variable, so this is appended to the end of wordPattern. The letterNums dictionary is
guaranteed to have letter for a key, because if it hadn’t, then lines 20 to 22 would have
handled adding it to letterNums before line 23.
makeWordPatterns.py

24.

return '.'.join(wordPattern)

After the for loop on line 19 is finished looping, the wordPattern list will contain all the
strings of the complete word pattern. Our word patterns have periods separating the integers, so
that we could tell the difference between “1.12” and “11.2”. To put these periods in between each
of the strings in the wordPattern list, line 24 calls the join() method on the string '.'.
This will evaluate to a string such as '0.1.2.2.3.3.4'. The completely-built string that
join() returns will be the return value of getWordPattern().

The Word Pattern Program’s main() Function
makeWordPatterns.py

27. def main():
28.
allPatterns = {}

The value stored in allPatterns is what we will write to the wordPatterns.py file. It is a
dictionary whose keys are strings of word patterns (such as '0.1.2.3.0.4.5' or

260

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

'0.1.1.2') and the keys’ values are a list of strings of English words that match that pattern.
For example, here’s one of the key-value pairs that will end up in allPatterns:
'0.1.0.2.3.1.4': ['DEDUCER', 'DEDUCES', 'GIGABIT', 'RARITAN']

But at the beginning of the main() function on line 28, the allPatterns variable will start
off as a blank dictionary value.
makeWordPatterns.py

30.
31.
32.

fo = open('dictionary.txt')
wordList = fo.read().split('\n')
fo.close()

Lines 30 to 32 read in the contents of the dictionary file into wordList. Chapter 11 covered
these file-related functions in more detail. Line 30 opens the dictionary.txt file in “reading” mode
and returns a file object. Line 31 calls the file object’s read() method which returns a string of
all text from this file. The rest of line 31 splits it up whenever there is a \n newline character, and
returns a list of strings: one string per line in the file. This list value returned from split() is
stored in the wordList variable. At this point we are done reading the file, so line 34 calls the
file object’s close() method.
The wordList variable will contain a list of tens of thousands of strings. Since the
dictionary.txt file has one English word per line of text, each string in the wordList variable
will be one English word.
makeWordPatterns.py

34.
35.
36.

for word in wordList:
# Get the pattern for each string in wordList.
pattern = getWordPattern(word)

The for loop on line 34 will iterate over each string in the wordList list and store it in the
word variable. The word variable is passed to the getWordPattern() function, which
returns a word pattern string for the string in word. The word pattern string is stored in a variable
named pattern.
makeWordPatterns.py

38.
39.
40.
41.

if pattern not in allPatterns:
allPatterns[pattern] = [word]
else:
allPatterns[pattern].append(word)

Chapter 18 – Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher

261

There must be a value for the pattern key first before we can append word to
allPatterns[pattern], otherwise this would cause an error. So, first line 38 will check if
the pattern is not already in allPatterns. If pattern is not a key in allPatterns yet,
line 39 creates a list with word in it to store in allPatterns[pattern].
If the pattern already is in allPatterns, we do not have to create the list. Line 41 will just
append the word to the list value that is already there.
By the time the for loop that started on line 34 finishes, the allPatterns dictionary will
contain the word pattern of each English word that was in wordList as its keys. Each of these
keys has a value that is a list of the words that produce the word pattern. With our data organized
this way, given a word pattern we can easily look up all the English words that produce that
particular pattern.
makeWordPatterns.py

43.
44.

# This is code that writes code. The wordPatterns.py file contains
# one very, very large assignment statement.
fo = open('wordPatterns.py', 'w')
fo.write('allPatterns = ')
fo.write(pprint.pformat(allPatterns))
fo.close()

Now that we have this very large dictionary in allPatterns, we want to save it to a file on the
hard drive. The last part of the main() function will create a file called wordPatterns.py which
will just have one huge assignment statement in it.
Line 45 creates a new file by passing the 'wordPatterns.py' string for the filename and
'w' to indicate that this file will be opened in “write” mode. If there is already a file with the
name 'wordPatterns.py', opening it in write mode will cause the file to be deleted to make
way for the new file we are creating.
Line 46 starts the file off with 'allPatterns = ', which is the first part of the assignment
statement. Line 47 finishes it by writing a prettified version of allPatterns to the file. Line
48 closes the file since we are done writing to it.
makeWordPatterns.py

51. if __name__ == '__main__':

Lines 51 and 52 call the main() function if this program was run by itself (to create the
wordPattern.py file) rather than imported by another program that wants to use its
getWordPattern() function.

Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher
The hacking program uses the abstract concepts of “word patterns” and “cipherletter mappings”.
But don’t worry, in our Python program “word patterns” are represented by string values and
“cipherletter mappings” are represented with dictionary values. The previous sections explained
what word patterns are and how to generate them from a string. Cipherletter mappings are used in
the hacking program to keep track of the possible letters that each of the 26 cipherletters could
decrypt to. Go ahead and type in the source code for the simpleSubHacker.py program.

Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher (in Theory)
Hacking the simple substitution cipher is pretty easy. The five steps are:
1. Find the word pattern for each cipherword in the ciphertext.
2. Find the list of English word candidates that each cipherword could decrypt to.
3. Create one cipherletter mapping for each cipherword using the cipherword’s list of
candidates. (A cipherletter mapping is just a dictionary value.)
4. Intersect each of the cipherletter mappings into a single intersected cipherletter mapping.
5. Remove any solved letters from the intersected cipherletter mapping.
The more cipher words that are in the ciphertext, the more cipherletter mappings we have that can
be intersected. The more cipherletter mappings we intersect together, the fewer the number of
potential decryption letters there will be for each cipher letter. This means that the longer the
ciphertext message, the more likely we are to hack and decrypt it.

Explore the Hacking Functions with the Interactive Shell
We’ve already described the steps used to hack a simple substitution encrypted message by using
word patterns. Before we learn how the code in these functions works, let’s use the interactive
shell to call them and see what values they return depending on what arguments we pass them.
Here is the example we will hack: OLQIHXIRCKGNZ PLQRZKBZB MPBKSSIPLC
The getBlankCipherletterMapping() function returns a cipherletter mapping. A
cipherletter mapping is just a dictionary with 26 keys of uppercase single-letter strings and
values of lists of single-letter uppercase strings like 'A' or 'Q'. We will store this blank
cipherletter mapping in a variable named letterMapping1. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> letterMapping1 = simpleSubHacker.getBlankCipherletterMapping()
>>> letterMapping1
{'A': [], 'C': [], 'B': [], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': [], 'F': [], 'I': [], 'H':
[], 'K': [], 'J': [], 'M': [], 'L': [], 'O': [], 'N': [], 'Q': [], 'P': [],
'S': [], 'R': [], 'U': [], 'T': [], 'W': [], 'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': [], 'Z':
[]}
>>>

Let’s start hacking the first cipherword, OLQIHXIRCKGNZ. First we will need to get the word
pattern for this cipherword by calling the makeWordPattern module’s
getWordPattern() function. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import makeWordPatterns

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 18 – Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher

267

>>> wordPat = makeWordPatterns.getWordPattern('OLQIHXIRCKGNZ')
>>> wordPat
0.1.2.3.4.5.3.6.7.8.9.10.11
>>>

To figure out which English words in the dictionary have the word pattern
0.1.2.3.4.5.3.6.7.8.9.10.11 (that is, to figure out the candidates for the cipherword
OLQIHXIRCKGNZ) we will import the wordPatterns module and look up this pattern. Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import wordPatterns
>>> candidates = wordPatterns.allPatterns['0.1.2.3.4.5.3.6.7.8.9.10.11']
>>> candidates
['UNCOMFORTABLE', 'UNCOMFORTABLY']
>>>

There are two English words that OLQIHXIRCKGNZ could decrypt to (that is, only two English
words that have the same word pattern that OLQIHXIRCKGNZ does): UNCOMFORTABLE and
UNCOMFORTABLY. (It’s also possible that the cipherword decrypts to a word that does not
exist in our dictionary, but we will just have to assume that’s not the case.) We need to create a
cipherletter mapping that has the cipherletters in OLQIHXIRCKGNZ map to letters in
UNCOMFORTABLE and UNCOMFORTABLY as potential decryption letters. That is, O maps
to U, L maps to N, Q maps to C, and so on. Z will map to two different letters: E and Y.
We can do this with the addLettersToMapping() function. We will need to pass it our
(currently blank) cipherletter mapping in letterMapping1, the string 'OLQIHXIRCKGNZ',
and the string 'UNCOMFORTABLE' (which is the first string in the candidates list). Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> letterMapping1 = simpleSubHacker.addLettersToMapping(letterMapping1,
'OLQIHXIRCKGNZ', candidates[0])
>>> letterMapping1
{'A': [], 'C': ['T'], 'B': [], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': ['B'], 'F': [], 'I':
['O'], 'H': ['M'], 'K': ['A'], 'J': [], 'M': [], 'L': ['N'], 'O': ['U'], 'N':
['L'], 'Q': ['C'], 'P': [], 'S': [], 'R': ['R'], 'U': [], 'T': [], 'W': [],
'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': ['F'], 'Z': ['E']}
>>>

From the letterMapping1 value, you can see that the letters in OLQIHXIRCKGNZ map to
the letters in UNCOMFORTABLE: 'O' maps to ['U'], 'L' maps to ['N'], 'Q' maps to
['C'], and so on.

268

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

But since the letters in OLQIHXIRCKGNZ could also possibly decrypt to UNCOMFORTABLY,
we also need to add UNCOMFORTABLY to the cipherletter mapping. Try typing the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> letterMapping1 = simpleSubHacker.addLettersToMapping(letterMapping1,
'OLQIHXIRCKGNZ', candidates[1])
>>> letterMapping1
{'A': [], 'C': ['T'], 'B': [], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': ['B'], 'F': [], 'I':
['O'], 'H': ['M'], 'K': ['A'], 'J': [], 'M': [], 'L': ['N'], 'O': ['U'], 'N':
['L'], 'Q': ['C'], 'P': [], 'S': [], 'R': ['R'], 'U': [], 'T': [], 'W': [],
'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': ['F'], 'Z': ['E', 'Y']}
>>>

You’ll notice that not much has changed in letterMapping1. The cipherletter mapping in
letterMapping1 now has 'Z' map to both 'E' and 'Y'. That’s because the candidates for
OLQIHXIRCKGNZ (that is, UNCOMFORTABLE and UNCOMFORTABLY) are very similar
to each other and addLettersToMapping() only adds the letter to the list if the letter is not
already there. This is why 'O' maps to ['U'] instead of ['U', 'U'].
We now have a cipherletter mapping for the first of the three cipherwords. We need to get a new
mapping for the second cipherword, PLQRZKBZB. Call
getBlankCipherletterMapping() and store the returned dictionary value in a variable
named letterMapping2. Get the word pattern for PLQRZKBZB and use it to look up all the
candidates in wordPatterns.allPatterns. This is done by typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> letterMapping2 = simpleSubHacker.getBlankCipherletterMapping()
>>> wordPat = makeWordPatterns.getWordPattern('PLQRZKBZB')
>>> candidates = wordPatterns.allPatterns[wordPat]
>>> candidates
['CONVERSES', 'INCREASES', 'PORTENDED', 'UNIVERSES']
>>>

Instead of typing out four calls to addLettersToMapping() for each of these four candidate
words, we can write a for loop that will go through the list in candidates and call
addLettersToMapping() each time.
>>> for candidate in candidates:
...
letterMapping2 = simpleSubHacker.addLettersToMapping(letterMapping2,
'PLQRZKBZB', candidate)
...
>>> letterMapping2

>>>

This finishes the cipherletter mapping for our second cipherword. Now we need to get the
intersection of the cipherletter mappings in letterMapping1 and letterMapping2 by
passing them to intersectMappings(). Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> intersectedMapping = simpleSubHacker.intersectMappings(letterMapping1,
letterMapping2)
>>> intersectedMapping
{'A': [], 'C': ['T'], 'B': ['S', 'D'], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': ['B'], 'F': [],
'I': ['O'], 'H': ['M'], 'K': ['A'], 'J': [], 'M': [], 'L': ['N'], 'O': ['U'],
'N': ['L'], 'Q': ['C'], 'P': ['C', 'I', 'P', 'U'], 'S': [], 'R': ['R'], 'U':
[], 'T': [], 'W': [], 'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': ['F'], 'Z': ['E']}
>>>

The intersected mapping is just a cipherletter mapping. The list of potential decryption letters for
any cipherletter in the intersected mapping will only be the potential decryption letters that were
in the cipherletter’s list in both letterMapping1 and letterMapping2.
For example, this is why intersectedMapping’s list for the 'Z' key is just ['E']:
because letterMapping1 had ['E', 'Y'] but letterMapping2 had ['E']. The
intersection of ['E', 'Y'] and ['E'] is just the potential decryption letters that exist in both
mappings: ['E']
There is an exception. If one of the mapping’s lists was blank, then all of the potential decryption
letters in the other mapping are put into the intersected mapping. This is because in our program a
blank map represents any possible letter can be used since nothing is known about the mapping.
Then we do all these steps for the third cipherword, MPBKSSIPLC. Try typing the following into
the interactive shell:
>>> letterMapping3 = simpleSubHacker.getBlankCipherletterMapping()
>>> wordPat = makeWordPatterns.getWordPattern('MPBKSSIPLC')
>>> candidates = wordPatterns.allPatterns[wordPat]
>>> candidates
['ADMITTEDLY', 'DISAPPOINT']
>>> for i in range(len(candidates)):

270

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

...
letterMapping3 = simpleSubHacker.addLettersToMapping(letterMapping3,
'MPBKSSIPLC', candidates[i])
...
>>> letterMapping3
{'A': [], 'C': ['Y', 'T'], 'B': ['M', 'S'], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': [], 'F': [],
'I': ['E', 'O'], 'H': [], 'K': ['I', 'A'], 'J': [], 'M': ['A', 'D'], 'L': ['L',
'N'], 'O': [], 'N': [], 'Q': [], 'P': ['D', 'I'], 'S': ['T', 'P'], 'R': [],
'U': [], 'T': [], 'W': [], 'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': [], 'Z': []}

We intersect letterMapping3 with intersectedMapping. This also ends up indirectly
intersecting letterMapping3 with letterMapping1 and letterMapping2, since
intersectedMapping is currently the intersection of letterMapping1 and
letterMapping2. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> intersectedMapping = simpleSubHacker.intersectMappings(intersectedMapping,
letterMapping3)
>>> intersectedMapping
{'A': [], 'C': ['T'], 'B': ['S'], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': ['B'], 'F': [], 'I':
['O'], 'H': ['M'], 'K': ['A'], 'J': [], 'M': ['A', 'D'], 'L': ['N'], 'O':
['U'], 'N': ['L'], 'Q': ['C'], 'P': ['I'], 'S': ['T', 'P'], 'R': ['R'], 'U':
[], 'T': [], 'W': [], 'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': ['F'], 'Z': ['E']}
>>>

We can now pass the intersected cipherletter mapping to
decryptWithCipherletterMapping() to decrypt the ciphertext. Try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>> simpleSubHacker.decryptWithCipherletterMapping('OLQIHXIRCKGNZ PLQRZKBZB
MPBKSSIPLC', intersectedMapping)
UNCOMFORTABLE INCREASES _ISA__OINT
>>>

The intersected mapping is not yet complete. Notice how the intersected mapping has a solution
for the cipherletter K, because the key 'K'’s value to a list with just one string in it: ['A'].
Because we know that the K cipherletters will decrypt to A, no other cipherletter can possibly
decrypt to A.
In the intersected mapping, the cipherletter M maps to ['A', 'D']. This means that judging
from the candidates for the cipherwords in our encrypted message, the cipherletter M could
decrypt to A or D.

Chapter 18 – Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher

271

But since we know K decrypts to A, we can remove A from the list of potential decryption letters
for cipherletter M. This shortens the list down to just ['D']. Because this new list only has one
string in it, we’ve also solved the cipherletter M!
The removeSolvedLettersFromMapping() function takes a cipherletter mapping and
removes these solved potential decryption letters from the other cipherletters’ lists. Try typing the
following into the interactive shell:
>>> letterMapping = removeSolvedLettersFromMapping(letterMapping)
>>> intersectedMapping
{'A': [], 'C': ['T'], 'B': ['S'], 'E': [], 'D': [], 'G': ['B'], 'F': [], 'I':
['O'], 'H': ['M'], 'K': ['A'], 'J': [], 'M
': ['D'], 'L': ['N'], 'O': ['U'], 'N': ['L'], 'Q': ['C'], 'P': ['I'], 'S':
['P'], 'R': ['R'], 'U': [], 'T': [], 'W': [],
'V': [], 'Y': [], 'X': ['F'], 'Z': ['E']}
>>>

Now when we pass the intersected mapping to decryptWithCipherletterMapping(), it
gives us the full solution. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> simpleSubHacker.decryptWithCipherletterMapping('OLQIHXIRCKGNZ PLQRZKBZB
MPBKSSIPLC', intersectedMapping)
UNCOMFORTABLE INCREASES DISAPPOINT
>>>

The ciphertext OLQIHXIRCKGNZ PLQRZKBZB MPBKSSIPLC decrypts to the message,
“Uncomfortable increases disappoint”.
This is a rather short ciphertext to hack. Normally the encrypted messages we hack will be much
longer. (Messages as short as our example usually cannot be hacked with our word pattern
method.) We’ll have to create a cipherletter mapping for each cipherword in these longer
messages and then intersect them all together, which is exactly what the hackSimpleSub()
function does.
Now that we know the basic steps and what each function does, let’s learn how the code in these
functions work.

How the Program Works
simpleSubHacker.py

1. # Simple Substitution Cipher Hacker
2. # http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed)

272

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The comments at the top of the source code explain what the program is.

Import All the Things
simpleSubHacker.py

4. import os, re, copy, pprint, pyperclip, simpleSubCipher, makeWordPatterns

Our simple substitution hacking program imports eight different modules, more than any other
program so far. By reusing the code in these modules, our hacking program becomes much
shorter and easier to write.
The re module is a module we haven’t seen before. This is the regular expression module which
lets our code do sophisticated string manipulation. Regular expressions are explained in the next
section.
simpleSubHacker.py

6. if not os.path.exists('wordPatterns.py'):
7.
makeWordPatterns.main() # create the wordPatterns.py file
8. import wordPatterns

The simple substitution cipher also needs the wordPatterns module. The .py file for this
module is created when the makeWordPatterns.py program is run. But
makeWordPatterns.py might not have been run before our hacking program has. In this case, our
hacking program checks if this file exists on line 6 and if it doesn’t, the
makeWordPatterns.main() function is called.
Remember, the main() function is the function that is run in our programs when they are run as
programs (rather than just imported with an import statement.) When we imported the
makeWordPatterns module on line 4, the main() function in makeWordPatterns.py was
not run. Since main() is the function that creates the wordPatterns.py file, we will call
makeWordPatterns.main() if wordPatterns.py does not yet exist.
Either way, by the time the program execution reaches line 8, the wordPatterns module will
exist and can be imported.

273

The simple substitution hacking program will have a LETTERS global variable like many of our
previous cipher programs.
The re.compile() function is new. This function compiles (that is, creates) a new regular
expression pattern object, or “regex object” or “pattern object” for short. Regular expressions are
strings that define a specific pattern that matches certain strings. Regular expressions can do
many special things with strings that are beyond the scope of this book, but you can learn about
them at http://invpy.com/regex.
The string '[^A-Za-z\s]' is a regular expression that matches any character that is not a
letter from A to Z or a “whitespace” character (e.g. a space, tab, or newline character). The
pattern object has a sub() method (short for “substitute”) that works very similar to the
replace() string method. The first argument to sub() is the string that replaces any instances
of the pattern in the second string argument. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> pat = re.compile('[^A-Z\s]')
>>> pat.sub('abc', 'ALL! NON!LETTERS? AND123 NONSPACES. REPLACED')
'ALLabc NONabcLETTERSabc ANDabcabcabc NONSPACESabc REPLACED'
>>> pat.sub('', 'ALL! NON!LETTERS? AND123 NONSPACES. REPLACED')
'ALL NONLETTERS AND NONSPACES REPLACED'
>>>

There are many sophisticated string manipulations you can perform if you learn more about
regular expressions, but we will only use them in this book to remove characters from a string
that are not uppercase letters or spaces.

letterMapping = hackSimpleSub(message)

Like all our previous hacking programs, the main() function will store the ciphertext to be
hacked in a variable named message. We will pass this variable to the hackSimpleSub()

274

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

function. However, unlike our previous hacking programs, the hacking function will not return a
string of the decrypted message (or None if it was unable to decrypt it).
Instead, hackSimpleSub() will return a cipherletter mapping (specifically, an intersected
cipherletter mapping that had the solved letters removed, like the kind we made in our interactive
shell exercise). This returned cipherletter mapping will be passed to
decryptWithCipherletterMapping() to decrypt the ciphertext in message.

'Y': ['F'],
'Z': ['Z']}

In the above example, the cipherletters A, C, I, J, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, X, Y, and Z all
have one and only one potential decryption letter. These cipher letters have been solved. The
decryptWithCipherletterMapping() function, explained later, will print underscores
for any cipherletters that have not been solved (that is, B, D, E, F, G, H, K, and V.)

print('Copying hacked message to clipboard:')
hackedMessage = decryptWithCipherletterMapping(message, letterMapping)

Next the decrypted message is returned from the decryptWithCipherletterMapping()
function on line 28. This hacked message is copied to the clipboard on line 29 and printed to the
screen on line 30.
Next, let’s look at all the functions that are called by main().

[], 'R': [], 'S': [], 'T': [], 'U': [], 'V': [], 'W': [], 'X': [],
'Z': []}

Our program will need a cipherletter mapping for each cipherword in the ciphertext, so we will
create the getBlankCipherletterMapping() function which can return a new, blank
mapping when called.

Adding Letters to a Cipherletter Mapping
simpleSubHacker.py

38. def addLettersToMapping(letterMapping, cipherword, candidate):

The addLettersToMapping() function attempts to make sure that every letter in the
candidate can be mapped to a letter in the cipherword. It checks over each letter in candidate
and adds its corresponding letter in cipherword to letterMapping if it wasn't already
there.
For example, if 'PUPPY' is our candidate word for the 'HGHHU' cipherword, the
addLettersToMapping() function will change letterMapping so that the key 'H' has
'P' added to its list of potential decryption letters. Then the function will change the key 'G' so
that its list has 'U' appended to it.
If the letter is already in the list of potential decryption letters, the addLettersToMapping()
will not add a letter to the list. We can skip adding 'P' to the 'H' key the next two times since
it’s already been done. Finally, the function will change the key 'U' so that it has 'Y' in its list
of potential decryption letters.
The code in this function assumes that len(cipherword) is the same as len(candidate).
simpleSubHacker.py

49.

letterMapping = copy.deepcopy(letterMapping)

To avoid changing the original dictionary value passed for the letterMapping parameter, line
49 will copy the dictionary in letterMapping and make this copy the new value in
letterMapping. (We have to do this because letterMapping was passed a copy of a
dictionary reference value, instead of a copy of the dictionary value. See the “List Reference”
section in Chapter 10 for an explanation of references.)
simpleSubHacker.py

50.

for i in range(len(cipherword)):

Line 50 will iterate over each index in the string in cipherword. We need the index (which is
stored in the variable i) because the potential decryption letter to be added will be
candidate[i] for the cipherletter cipherword[i].

letterMapping[cipherword[i]].append(candidate[i])

The if statement on line 51 checks that the potential decryption letter is not already in the list of
potential decryption letters for the cipherletter. This prevents the list of potential decryption
letters in the cipherletter mapping from having duplicate letters in it. For example, we never want
the list to be a value like ['U', 'U'].
Line 52 adds the new potential decryption letter (that is, candidate[i]) to the list of potential
decryption letters in the cipherletter mapping (that is, letterMapping[cipherword[i]]).

After looping through all the indexes in cipherword, the additions to the cipherletter mapping
are complete and the dictionary in letterMapping is returned.

The intersectMappings() function will return a new cipherletter mapping that is an
intersection of the two cipherletter mappings passed for the mapA and mapB parameters. Line 59
creates a new cipherletter mapping by calling getBlankCipherletterMapping() and
storing the returned value in the intersectedMapping variable.
The for loop will loop through each of the uppercase letters in the LETTERS constant variable,
and the letter variable can be used for the keys of the mapA and mapB dictionaries.

If the list of potential decryption letters for a cipherletter in a cipherletter mapping is blank, this
means that this cipherletter could potentially decrypt to any letter. In this case, the intersected
cipherletter mapping will just be a copy of the other mapping’s list of potential decryption letters.
That is, if mapA’s list of potential decryption letters is blank, then set the intersected mapping’s
list to be a copy of mapB’s list. Or if mapB’s list is blank, then set the intersected mapping’s list
to be a copy of mapA’s list.
(If both mappings’ lists were blank, then line 65 will simply copy mapB’s blank list to the
intersected mapping. This is the behavior we want: if both lists are blank then the intersected
mapping will have a blank list.)

for mappedLetter in mapA[letter]:
if mappedLetter in mapB[letter]:
intersectedMapping[letter].append(mappedLetter)

The else block handles the case where neither mapA nor mapB are blank. In this case, line 71
loops through the uppercase letter strings in the list at mapA[letter]. Line 72 checks if this
uppercase letter in mapA[letter] also exists in the list of uppercase letter strings in
mapB[letter]. If it does, then line 73 will add this common letter to the list of potential
decryption letters at intersectedMapping[letter].
simpleSubHacker.py

return intersectedMapping

Once the for loop that started on line 60 has finished, the cipherletter mapping in
intersectedMapping will only have the potential decryption letters that exist in the lists of
potential decryption letters of both mapA and mapB. This completely intersected cipherletter
mapping is returned on line 75.

# remove 'N' from the list of what 'A' could map to. So 'A' then maps
# to ['M']. Note that now that 'A' maps to only one letter, we can
# remove 'M' from the list of potential letters for every other
# key. (This is why there is a loop that keeps reducing the map.)
letterMapping = copy.deepcopy(letterMapping)
loopAgain = True

The removeSolvedLettersFromMapping() function searches for any cipherletters in the
letterMapping parameter which have one and only one potential decryption letter. These
cipherletters are considered solved: the cipherletter must decrypt to that one potential decryption
letter. This means that any other cipherletters that have this solved letter can have that letter
removed from their lists of potential decryption letters.
This could cause a chain reaction, because when the one potential decryption letter is removed
from other lists of potential decryption letters, it could result in a new solved cipherletter. In that
case, the program will loop and perform the solved letter removal over the whole cipherletter
mapping again.
The cipherletter mapping in letterMapping is copied on line 87 so that changes made to it in the
function do not affect the dictionary value outside the function. Line 88 creates loopAgain,
which is a variable that holds a Boolean value that tells us if the code found a new solved letter
and needs to loop again. In that case the loopAgain variable is set to True on line 88 so that
the program execution will enter the while loop on line 89.
simpleSubHacker.py

89.
90.
91.

while loopAgain:
# First assume that we will not loop again:
loopAgain = False

At the very beginning of the loop, line 91 will set loopAgain to False. The code assumes that
this will be the last iteration through line 89’s while loop. The loopAgain variable is only set
to True if we find a new solved cipherletter during this iteration.

280

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The next part of the code creates a list of cipherletters that have exactly one potential decryption
letter. We will put these cipherletter strings in a list that is in solvedLetters. The
solvedLetters variable starts off as a blank list on line 95.
The for loop on line 96 goes through all 26 possible cipherletters and looks at the cipherletter
mapping’s list of potential decryption letters for that cipherletter. (That is, the list is at
letterMapping[cipherletter].)
If the length of this list is 1 (which is checked on line 97), then we know that there is only one
letter that the cipherletter could decrypt to and the cipherletter is solved. We will add the letter
(the potential decryption letter, not the cipherletter) to the solvedLetters list on line 98. The
solved letter will always be at letterMapping[cipherletter][0] because
letterMapping[cipherletter] is a list of potential decryption letters that only has one
string value in it at index 0 of the list.

After the previous for loop that started on line 96 has finished, the solvedLetters variable
will be a list of all the letters that are solved decryptions of a cipherletter. The for loop on line
103 loops through all 26 possible cipherletters and looks at the cipherletter mapping’s list of
potential decryption letters.
For each cipherletter that is examined, the letters in solvedLetters are looped through on
line 104 to check if each of them exist in the list of potential decryption letters for
letterMapping[cipherletter]. Line 105 checks if a list of potential decryption letters is
not solved (that is, if len(letterMapping[cipherletter]) != 1) and the solved
letter exists in the list of potential decryption letters. If this condition is True, then the solved
letter in s is removed from the list of potential decryption letters on line 106.

If by chance this removal caused the list of potential decryption letters to now only have one
letter in it, then the loopAgain variable is set to True on line 109 so that the code will check
for this new solved letter in the cipherletter mapping on the next iteration.

After the code in line 89’s while loop has gone through a full iteration without loopAgain
being set to True, the program execution goes past the loop and returns the cipherletter mapping
stored in letterMapping.

Hacking the Simple Substitution Cipher
simpleSubHacker.py

113. def hackSimpleSub(message):
114.
intersectedMap = getBlankCipherletterMapping()

Now that we’ve created the getBlankCipherletterMapping(),
addLettersToMapping(), intersectMappings(), and
removeSolvedLettersFromMapping() functions that can manipulate the cipherletter
mappings we pass them, we can use them all together to hack a simple substitution message.
Remember the steps from our interactive shell exercise for hacking a simple substitution cipher
message: for each cipherword, get all the candidates based on the cipherword’s word pattern, then
add these candidates to a cipherletter mapping. Then take the cipherletter mapping for each
cipherword and intersect them together.
The intersectedMap variable will hold the intersected cipherletter mapping of each
cipherword’s cipherletter mapping. At the beginning of the hackSimpleSub() function, it
will start as a blank cipherletter mapping.
simpleSubHacker.py

115.
cipherwordList = nonLettersOrSpacePattern.sub('',
message.upper()).split()

The sub() regex method will substitute (that is, replace) any occurrences of the string pattern in
the second argument (message.upper()) with the first argument (a blank string). Regular
expressions and the sub() method were explained earlier in this chapter.
On line 115, the regex object in nonLettersOrSpacePattern matches any string that is not
a letter or whitespace character. The sub() method will return a string that is the message

282

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

variable with all non-letter and non-space characters replaced by a blank string. This effectively
returns a string that has all punctuation and number characters removed from message.
This string then has the upper() method called on it to return an uppercase version of the
string, and that string has the split() method called on it to return the individual words in the
string in a list. To see what each part of line 115 does, type the following into the interactive
shell:
>>> import re
>>> nonLettersOrSpacePattern = re.compile('[^A-Z\s]')
>>> message = 'Hello, this is my 1st test message.'
>>> message = nonLettersOrSpacePattern.sub('', message.upper())
>>> message
'HELLO THIS IS MY ST TEST MESSAGE'
>>> cipherwordList = message.split()
>>> cipherwordList
['HELLO', 'THIS', 'IS', 'MY', 'ST', 'TEST', 'MESSAGE']

After line 115 executes, the cipherwordList variable will contain a list of uppercase strings
of the individual words that were previously in message.
simpleSubHacker.py

116.
117.
118.

for cipherword in cipherwordList:
# Get a new cipherletter mapping for each ciphertext word.
newMap = getBlankCipherletterMapping()

The for loop on line 116 will assign each string in the message list to the cipherword
variable. Inside this loop we will get the cipherword’s candidates, add the candidates to a
cipherletter mapping, and then intersect this mapping with intersectedMap.
First, line 118 will get a new, blank cipherletter mapping from
getBlankCipherletterMapping() and store it in the newMap variable.

wordPattern = makeWordPatterns.getWordPattern(cipherword)

To find the candidates for the current cipherword, we call getWordPattern() in the
makeWordPatterns module on line 120. If the word pattern of the cipherword does not exist
in the keys of the wordPatterns.allPatterns dictionary, then whatever the cipherword

will skip back to line 116, to the next cipherword in the list.

125.
126.

# Add the letters of each candidate to the mapping.
for candidate in wordPatterns.allPatterns[wordPattern]:
newMap = addLettersToMapping(newMap, cipherword, candidate)

On line 125, we know the word pattern exists in wordPatterns.allPatterns. The values
in the allPatterns dictionary are lists of strings of the English words with the pattern in
wordPattern. Since it is a list, we can use a for loop to iterate over this list. The variable
candidate will be set to each of these English word strings on each iteration of the loop.
The only line inside line 125’s for loop is the call to addLettersToMapping() on line 126.
We will use this to update the cipherletter mapping in newMap with the letters in each of the
candidates.
simpleSubHacker.py

128.
129.

# Intersect the new mapping with the existing intersected mapping.
intersectedMap = intersectMappings(intersectedMap, newMap)

Once all of the letters in the candidates are added to the cipherletter mapping in newMap, line
129 will intersect newMap with intersectedMap, and make the return value the new value of
intersectedMap.
At this point the program execution jumps back to the beginning of the for loop on line 116 to
run the code on the next cipherword in the cipherwordList list.
simpleSubHacker.py

131.
132.

# Remove any solved letters from the other lists.
return removeSolvedLettersFromMapping(intersectedMap)

Once we have the final intersected cipherletter mapping, we can remove any solved letters from it
by passing it to removeSolvedLettersFromMapping(). The cipherletter mapping that is
returned from the function will be the return value for hackSimpleSubstitution().

Creating a Key from a Letter Mapping
simpleSubHacker.py

# First create a simple sub key from the letterMapping mapping.
key = ['x'] * len(LETTERS)

Since the simpleSubstitutionCipher.decryptMessage() function only decrypts
with keys instead of letter mappings, we need the decryptWithCipherletterMapping()
function to convert a letter mapping into a string key.
The simple substitution keys are strings of 26 characters. The character at index 0 in the key
string is the substitution for A, the character at index 1 is the substitution for B, and so on.
Since the letter mapping might only have solutions for some of the letters, we will start out with a
key of ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x',
'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x',
'x']. This list is created on line 140 by using list replication to replicate the list ['x'] 26
times. Since LETTERS is a string of the letters of the alphabet, len(LETTERS) evaluates to
26. When the multiplication operator is used on a list and integer, it does list replication.
We don’t have to use 'x', we can use any lowercase letter. The reason we need to use a
lowercase letter is because it acts as a “placeholder” for the simple substitution key. The way
simpleSubCipher.py works, since LETTERS only contains uppercase letters, any lowercase letters
in the key will not be used to decrypt a message.
The 26-item list in key will be joined together into a 26-character string at the end of the
decryptWithCipherletterMapping() function.
simpleSubHacker.py

141.
142.
143.
144.
145.

for cipherletter in LETTERS:
if len(letterMapping[cipherletter]) == 1:
# If there's only one letter, add it to the key.
keyIndex = LETTERS.find(letterMapping[cipherletter][0])
key[keyIndex] = cipherletter

The for loop on line 141 will let us go through each of the letters in LETTERS for the
cipherletter variable, and if the cipherletter is solved (that is,
letterMapping[cipherletter] has only one letter in it) then we can replace an 'x' in
the key with the letter.
So on line 144 letterMapping[cipherletter][0] is the decryption letter, and
keyIndex is the index of the decryption letter in LETTERS (which is returned from the
find() call). This index in the key list is set to the decryption letter on line 145.

else:
ciphertext = ciphertext.replace(cipherletter.lower(), '_')
ciphertext = ciphertext.replace(cipherletter.upper(), '_')

Or else, if the cipherletter does not have a solution, then we want to replace everywhere that
cipherletter appears in the ciphertext with an underscore so the user can tell which characters
were unsolved. Line 147 handles replacing the lowercase form of cipherletter with an
underscore and line 148 handles replacing the uppercase form of cipherletter with an
underscore.

key = ''.join(key)
# With the key we've created, decrypt the ciphertext.
return simpleSubCipher.decryptMessage(key, ciphertext)

When we have finally replaced all the parts in the list in key with the solved letters, we convert
the list of strings into a single string with the join() method to create a simple substitution key.
This string is passed to the decryptMessage() function in our simpleSubCipher.py program.
The decrypted message string returned from decryptMessage() is then returned from
decryptWithCipherletterMapping() on line 152.
simpleSubHacker.py

155. if __name__ == '__main__':

main()

That completes all the functions our hacking program needs. Lines 155 and 156 just call the
main() function to run the program if simpleSubHacker.py is being run directly, instead of
being imported as a module by another Python program.

Couldn’t We Just Encrypt the Spaces Too?
Yes. Our hacking approach only works if the spaces were not encrypted. You can modify the
simple substitution cipher from the previous chapter to encrypt spaces, numbers, and punctuation
characters as well as letters, and it would make your encrypted messages harder (but not
impossible) to hack. However, since the spaces will probably be the most common symbol in the
ciphertext, you can write a program to replace it back to spaces, and then hack the ciphertext as
normal. So encrypting the space characters would not offer much more protection.

Summary
Whew! This hacking program was fairly complicated. The cipherletter mapping is the main tool
for modeling the possible letters that each ciphertext letter can decrypt to. By adding letters
(based on the candidates for each cipherword) to the mapping, and then intersecting mappings
and removing solved letters from other lists of potential decryption letters, we can narrow down
the number of possible keys. Instead of trying all 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible
keys we can use some sophisticated Python code to figure out exactly what most (if not all) of the
original simple substitution key was.
The main strength of the simple substitution cipher is the large number of possible keys. But the
downfall is that it is easy enough to compare the cipherwords to words in a dictionary file to
slowly figure out which cipherletters decrypt to which letters. The next chapter’s cipher is much
more powerful. For several hundred years, it was considered impossible to break. It is a
“polyalphabetic” substitution cipher called the Vigenère cipher.

Le Chiffre Indéchiffrable
The Vigenère cipher is a stronger cipher than the ones we’ve seen before. There are too many
possible keys to brute-force, even with English detection. It cannot be broken with the word
pattern attack that worked on the simple substitution cipher. It was possibly first described in
1553 by Italian cryptographer Giovan Battista Bellaso (though it has been reinvented many times,
including by Blaise de Vigenère). It is thought to have remained unbroken until Charles Babbage,
considered to be the father of computers, broke it in the 19th century. It was called “le chiffre
indéchiffrable”, French for “the indecipherable cipher”.

Multiple “Keys” in the Vigenère Key
The Vigenère cipher is similar to the Caesar cipher, except with multiple keys. Because it uses
more than one set of substitutions, it is also called a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
Remember that the Caesar cipher had a key from 0 to 25. For the Vigenère cipher, instead of
using a numeric key, we will use a letter key. The letter A will be used for key 0. The letter B will
be used for key 1, and so on up to Z for the key 25.

289

The key in a Vigenère cipher is a series of letters, such as a single English word. This single
word key will be split into multiple subkeys. If we use a Vigenère key of “PIZZA”, then the
first subkey is P, the second subkey is I, the third and fourth subkeys are both Z and the fifth
subkey is A. We will use the first subkey to encrypt the first letter of the plaintext, and the second
subkey to encrypt the second letter, and so on. When we get to the sixth letter of the plaintext, we
will go back to using the first subkey.
The Vigenère cipher is the same as using multiple Caesar ciphers in the same message.
Figure 19-3. Multiple Caesar ciphers combine to make the Vigenère cipher

The following shows which subkey will encrypt which letters in the message, “Common sense is
not so common.” with the Vigenère key, “PIZZA”.
COMMONSENSEISNOTSOCOMMON
PIZZAPIZZAPIZZAPIZZAPIZZ

To encrypt the first C with the subkey P, encrypt it with the Caesar cipher using numeric key 15
(15 is the number for the letter P) which creates the ciphertext R, and so on. Do this for each of
the letters of the plaintext. The following table shows this process:

So using the Vigenère cipher with the key “PIZZA” (which is made up of the subkeys 15, 8, 25,
25, 0) the plaintext “Common sense is not so common.” becomes the ciphertext “Rwlloc admst qr
moi an bobunm.”
The more letters in the Vigenère key, the stronger the encrypted message will be against a bruteforce attack. The choice of “PIZZA” is a poor one for a Vigenère key, because it only has five
letters. A key with only five letters has 11,881,376 possible combinations. (26 ^ 5 = 26 × 26 × 26
× 26 × 26 = 11,881,376) Eleven million keys is far too many for a human to try out, but a
computer could try them all in a few hours. It would first try to decrypt the message with the key
“AAAAA” and check if the resulting decryption was in English. Then it could try “AAAAB”,
then “AAAAC”, until it got to “PIZZA”.

The good news is that for every additional letter the key has, the number of possible keys
multiplies by 26. Once there are quadrillions of possible keys, it would take a computer years to
break. Table 19-2 shows how many possible keys there are for each length:

Once we get to keys that are twelve or more letters long, then it becomes impossible for most
consumer laptops to crack in a reasonable amount of time.
A Vigenère key does not have to be a word like “PIZZA”. It can be any combination of letters,
such as “DURIWKNMFICK”. In fact, it is much better not to use a word that can be found in the
dictionary. The word “RADIOLOGISTS” is a 12-letter key that is easier to remember than
“DURIWKNMFICK” even though they have the same number of letters. But a cryptanalyst
might anticipate that the cryptographer is being lazy by using an English word for the Vigenère
key. There are 95,428,956,661,682,176 possible 12-letter keys, but there are only about 1,800 12letter words in our dictionary file. If you are using a 12-letter English word, it would be easier to
brute-force that ciphertext than it would be to brute-force the ciphertext from a 3-letter random
key.
Of course, the cryptographer is helped by the fact that the cryptanalyst does not know how many
letters long the Vigenère key is. But the cryptanalyst could try all 1-letter keys, then all 2-letter
keys, and so on.

myMessage = """Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician,
logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was highly influential in
the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts
of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine. Turing is widely
considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.
During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School
(GCCS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he was head
of Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a
number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the
bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma
machine. After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he
created one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, the ACE. In
1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Laboratory at Manchester University,
where he assisted in the development of the Manchester computers and became
interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of
morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, which were first observed in the 1960s. Turing's
homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts
were still illegal in the United Kingdom. He accepted treatment with female
hormones (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in
1954, just over two weeks before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An
inquest determined that his death was suicide; his mother and some others
believed his death was accidental. On 10 September 2009, following an Internet
campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology
on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." As
of May 2012 a private member's bill was before the House of Lords which would
grant Turing a statutory pardon if enacted."""

The main() function for the Vigenère cipher is exactly like the other main() functions in this
book: there are variables for message, key, and mode. The user sets these variables on lines
10, 11, and 12 before running the program. The encrypted or decrypted message (depending on
what myMode is set to) is stored in a variable named translated so that it can be printed to
the screen (on line 20) and copied to the clipboard (on line 21).
The code that does the actual encryption and decryption is in translateMessage(), which is
explained later.
vigenereCipher.py

26. def encryptMessage(key, message):
27.
return translateMessage(key, message, 'encrypt')
28.
29.
30. def decryptMessage(key, message):
31.
return translateMessage(key, message, 'decrypt')

Since the encryption and decryption use much of the same code as the other, we put them both in
translateMessage(). The encryptMessage() and decryptMessage() functions
are wrapper functions for translateMessage(). (Wrapper functions were covered in
Chapter 17.)
vigenereCipher.py

34. def translateMessage(key, message, mode):
35.
translated = [] # stores the encrypted/decrypted message string
36.
37.
keyIndex = 0

296

38.

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

key = key.upper()

In the translateMessage() function, we will slowly build the encrypted (or decrypted)
string one character at a time. The list in translated will store these characters so that they
can be joined together once the string building is done. (The reason we use a list instead of just
appending the characters to a string is explained in the “Building Strings in Python with Lists”
section in Chapter 18.)
Remember, the Vigenère cipher is just the Caesar cipher except that a different key is used
depending on the position of the letter in the message. The keyIndex variable keeps track of
which subkey to use. The keyIndex variable starts off as 0, because the letter used to encrypt
or decrypt the first character of the message will be the one at key[0].
Our code assumes that the key has only uppercase letters. To make sure the key is valid, line 38
sets the key to be the uppercase version of it.
vigenereCipher.py

for symbol in message: # loop through each character in message
num = LETTERS.find(symbol.upper())
if num != -1: # -1 means symbol.upper() was not found in LETTERS
if mode == 'encrypt':
num += LETTERS.find(key[keyIndex]) # add if encrypting
elif mode == 'decrypt':
num -= LETTERS.find(key[keyIndex]) # subtract if decrypting

The rest of the code in translateMessage() is similar to the Caesar cipher code. The for
loop on line 40 sets the characters in message to the variable symbol on each iteration of the
loop. On line 41 we find the index of the uppercase version of this symbol in LETTERS. (This is
how we translate a letter into a number).
If num was not set to -1 on line 41, then the uppercase version of symbol was found in
LETTERS (meaning that symbol is a letter). The keyIndex variable keeps track of which
subkey to use, and the subkey itself will always be what key[keyIndex] evaluates to.
Of course, this is just a single letter string. We need to find this letter’s index in the LETTERS to
convert the subkey into an integer. This integer is then added (if encrypting) to the symbol’s
number on line 44 or subtracted (if decrypting) to the symbol’s number on line 46.
vigenereCipher.py

num %= len(LETTERS) # handle the potential wrap-around

297

In the Caesar cipher code, we checked if the new value of num was less than 0 (in which case, we
added len(LETTERS) to it) or if the new value of num was len(LETTERS) or greater (in
which case, we subtracted len(LETTERS) from it). This handles the “wrap-around” cases.
However, there is a simpler way that handles both of these cases. If we mod the integer stored in
num by len(LETTERS), then this will do the exact same thing except in a single line of code.
For example, if num was -8 we would want to add 26 (that is, len(LETTERS)) to it to get 18.
Or if num was 31 we would want to subtract 26 to get 5. However -8 % 26 evaluates to 18
and 31 % 26 evaluates to 5. The modular arithmetic on line 48 handles both “wrap-around”
cases for us.

# add the encrypted/decrypted symbol to the end of translated.
if symbol.isupper():
translated.append(LETTERS[num])
elif symbol.islower():
translated.append(LETTERS[num].lower())

The encrypted (or decrypted) character exists at LETTERS[num]. However, we want the
encrypted (or decrypted) character’s case to match symbol’s original case. So if symbol is an
uppercase letter, the condition on line 51 will be True and line 52 will append the character at
LETTERS[num] to translated. (Remember, all the characters in the LETTERS string are
already uppercase.)
However, if symbol is a lowercase letter, than the condition on line 53 will be True instead and
line 54 will append the lowercase form of LETTERS[num] to translated instead. This is
how we can get the encrypted (or decrypted) message to match the casing of the original
message.
vigenereCipher.py

56.
57.
58.

keyIndex += 1 # move to the next letter in the key
if keyIndex == len(key):
keyIndex = 0

Now that we have translated the symbol, we want to make sure that on the next iteration of the
for loop we use the next subkey. Line 56 increments keyIndex by one. This way when the
next iteration uses key[keyIndex] to get the subkey, it will be the index to the next subkey.

298

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

However, if we were on the last subkey in the key, then keyIndex would be equal to the length
of key. Line 57 checks for this condition, and resets keyIndex back to 0 on line 58. That way
key[keyIndex] will point back to the first subkey.
vigenereCipher.py

59.
60.
61.

else:
# The symbol was not in LETTERS, so add it to translated as is.
translated.append(symbol)

From the indentation you can tell that the else statement on line 59 is paired with the if
statement on line 42. The code on line 61 executes if the symbol was not found in the LETTERS
string. This happens if symbol is a number or punctuation mark such as '5' or '?'. In this
case, line 61 will just append the symbol untranslated.
vigenereCipher.py

63.

return ''.join(translated)

Now that we are done building the string in translated, we call the join() method on the
blank string to join together all the strings in translated (with a blank in between them).
vigenereCipher.py

66. # If vigenereCipher.py is run (instead of imported as a module) call
67. # the main() function.
68. if __name__ == '__main__':
69.
main()

Lines 68 and 69 call the main() function if this program was run by itself, rather than imported
by another program that wants to use its encryptMessage() and decryptMessage()
functions.

Summary
We are close to the end of the book, but notice how the Vigenère cipher isn’t that much more
complicated than the second cipher program in this book, the Caesar cipher. With just a few
changes, we can create a cipher that has exponentially many more possible keys than can be
brute-forced.
The Vigenère cipher is not vulnerable to the dictionary word pattern attack that our Simple
Substitution hacker program uses. The “indecipherable cipher” kept secret messages secret for
hundreds of years. The attack on the Vigenère cipher was not widely known until the early 20th
century. But of course, this cipher too eventually fell. In the next couple of chapters, we will learn
new “frequency analysis” techniques to hack the Vigenère cipher.

The ineffable talent for finding patterns in chaos
cannot do its thing unless he immerses himself in
the chaos first. If they do contain patterns, he does
not see them just now, in any rational way. But
there may be some subrational part of his mind
that can go to work, now that the letters have
passed before his eyes and through his pencil, and
that may suddenly present him with a gift-wrapped
clue--or even a full solution--a few weeks from
now while he is shaving or antenna-twiddling.

A coin has 2 sides, and when you flip a coin, about half the time it will come up heads and half of
the time it comes up tails. The frequency (that is, how often) that the coin flip ends up heads is
the same as the frequency that it ends up tails: about one-half or 50%.
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, but they don’t each appear an equal amount of the
time in English text. Some letters are used more often than others. For example, if you look at the
letters in this book you will find that the letters E, T, A and O occur very frequently in English
words. But the letters J, X, Q, and Z are rarely found in English text. We can use this fact to help
crack Vigenère-encrypted messages. This technique is called frequency analysis.
Here are the frequencies of the 26 letters in average English text. This graph is compiled by
grabbing English text from books, newspapers, and other sources to count often each letter
appears:
Figure 20-1. Letter frequency of normal English.

If we sort these in order of greatest frequency to least, we find that E is the most frequent letter,
followed by T, followed by A, and so on:

Chapter 20 – Frequency Analysis

301

Figure 20-2. Letter frequency of normal English, sorted.

The word “ETAOIN” is a handy way to remember the six most frequent letters. The full list of
letters ordered by frequency is “ETAOINSHRDLCUMWFGYPBVKJXQZ”.
Think about the transposition cipher: Messages encrypted with the transposition cipher contain all
the original letters of the original English plaintext, except in a different order. But the frequency
of each letter in the ciphertext remains the same: E, T, and A should occur much more often than
Q and Z. Because they are the same letters, the frequencies of these letters in the ciphertext are
the same as the plaintext.
The Caesar and simple substitution ciphers have their letters replaced, but you can still count the
frequency of the letters. The letters may be different but the frequencies are the same. There
should be letters that occur the most often in the ciphertext. These letters are good candidates for
being cipherletters for the E, T, or A letters. The letters in the ciphertext that occur least are more
likely to be X, Q, and Z.
This counting of letters and how frequently they appear in both plaintexts and ciphertexts is
called frequency analysis.
Since the Vigenère cipher is essentially multiple Caesar cipher keys used in the same message,
we can use frequency analysis to hack each subkey one at a time based on the letter frequency of
the attempted decryptions. We can’t use English word detection, since any word in the ciphertext
will have been encrypted with multiple subkeys. But we don’t need full words, we can analyze

302

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

the letter frequency of each subkey’s decrypted text. (This will be explained more in the next
chapter.)

Matching Letter Frequencies
By “matching the letter frequency of regular English” we could try several different algorithms.
The one used in our hacking program will simply order the letters from most frequent to least
frequent. We will calculate what we will call in this book a frequency match score for this
ordering of frequencies. To calculate the frequency match score for a string, the score starts at 0
and each time one of the letters E, T, A, O, I, N appears among the six most frequent letters of the
string, we add a point to the score. And each time one of the letters V, K, J, X, Q, or Z appears
among the six least frequent letters of the string, we add a point to the score. The frequency match
score for a string will be an integer from 0 (meaning the letter frequency of the string is
completely unlike regular English’s letter frequency) to 12 (meaning it is identical to regular
English’s letter frequency).

An Example of Calculating Frequency Match Score
For example, look at this ciphertext which was encrypted with a simple substitution cipher:
“Sy l nlx sr pyyacao l ylwj eiswi upar lulsxrj isr sxrjsxwjr, ia esmm
rwctjsxsza sj wmpramh, lxo txmarr jia aqsoaxwa sr pqaceiamnsxu, ia esmm caytra

rmsuijarj aqsoaxwa. Jia pcsusx py nhjir sr agbmlsxao sx jisr elh. -Facjclxo
Ctrramm”

If we count the frequency of each letter and then arrange them by order of its frequency, we end
up with this ordering: ASRXJILPWMCYOUEQNTHBFZGKVD. That is, A is the most frequent
letter, S is the 2nd most frequent letter, and so on down to the letter D, which appears the least
frequently.
The six most frequent letters in this ordering are A, S, R, X, J, and I. Only two of these letters (A
and I) appear in the ETAOIN set of letters. The six least frequent letters in the ordering are F, Z,
G, K, V, and D. Only three of these letters (Z, K, and V) appear in the VKJXQZ set of letters. So
the frequency ordering ASRXJILPWMCYOUEQNTHBFZGKVD (which comes from the above
ciphertext) has a frequency match score of 5.

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 20 – Frequency Analysis

303

Figure 20-3. How the frequency match score of ASRXJILPWMCYOUEQNTHBFZGKVD is calculated.
The above ciphertext was encrypted with a simple substitution cipher, which is why the
frequency match score isn’t very high. The letter frequencies of simple substitution ciphertext
won’t match regular English’s letter frequencies.

Another Example of Calculating Frequency Match Score
For another example, look at this ciphertext which was encrypted with a transposition cipher:
“I rc ascwuiluhnviwuetnh,osgaa ice tipeeeee slnatsfietgi tittynecenisl. e fo f
fnc isltn sn o a yrs sd onisli ,l erglei trhfmwfrogotn,l stcofiit.aea

The ordering of most to least frequent letters in the above ciphertext is:
EISNTHAOCLRFDGWVMUYBPZXQJK. (That is, E is the most frequent letter, I the 2nd most
frequent letter, and so on.)
Of the top and bottom six letters in this ordering, the four letters E, I, N, and T appear in ETAOIN
and the five letters Z, X, Q, J, and K appear in VKJXQZ. This gives the ordering a frequency
match score of 9.

Figure 20-4. How the frequency match score of EISNTHAOCLRFDGWVMUYBPZXQJK is calculated.

304

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The above ciphertext was encrypted with a transposition cipher, so it has all the same letters as
the original English plaintext (their order has just been switched around.) This is why the
frequency ordering has a much higher frequency match score.

Hacking Each Subkey
When hacking the Vigenère cipher, we try to decrypt the letters for the first subkey with each of
the 26 possible letters and find out which decrypted ciphertext produces a letter frequency that
closest matches that of regular English. This is a good indication that we have found the correct
subkey.
We can do this same thing for the second, third, fourth, and fifth subkey as well. Since we are
only doing 26 decryptions for each subkey individually, our computer only has to perform 26 +
26 + 26 + 26 + 26, or 156, decryptions. This is much easier than trying to do 11,881,376
decryptions!
So, hacking the Vigenère cipher sounds simple in theory. Just try all 26 possible subkeys for each
subkey in the key, and see which one produces decrypted text that has a letter frequency that
closest matches the letter frequency of English.
It turns out that there are a few more steps than this, though, but we can cover them when we
write the hacking program in the next chapter. For this chapter, we will write a module with
several helpful functions that perform frequency analysis. This module will have these functions:





getLetterCount() – This function will take a string parameter and return a dictionary
that has the count of how often each letter appears in the string.
getFrequencyOrder() – This function will take a string parameter and return a string of
the 26 letters ordered from those that appear most frequently to least frequently in the string
parameter.
englishFreqMatchScore() – This function will take a string parameter and return an
integer from 0 to 12 of the string’s letter frequency match score.

The englishLetterFreq dictionary will contain strings of the letters of the alphabet as keys
and a float for their percentage frequency as the value. (These values come from the Wikipedia
article for letter frequency: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency) The
englishLetterFreq value isn’t actually used by our program. It is simply here for your
future reference in case you write a program that needs it.

The Most Common Letters, “ETAOIN”
freqAnalysis.py

8. ETAOIN = 'ETAOINSHRDLCUMWFGYPBVKJXQZ'

We will create a variable named ETAOIN on line 8 which will have the 26 letters of the alphabet
in order of most frequent to least frequent. The word ETAOIN is a handy way to remember the
six most common letters in English. Of course, this ordering isn’t always going to be perfect. You
could easily find a book that has a set of letter frequencies where Z is used more often than Q, for
example. Gadsby by Ernest Vicent Wright is a novel that never uses the letter E, which gives it a
very odd set of letter frequencies. But in most cases, the “ETAOIN order” will be accurate.
freqAnalysis.py

9. LETTERS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

Our module will also need a string of all the uppercase letters of the alphabet for a few different
functions, so we set the LETTERS constant variable on line 9.

308

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The getLetterCount() function returns a dictionary value where the keys are single
uppercase letter strings, and the values are an integer showing how many times that letter occurs
in the message parameter. For example, a certain string value for the message parameter with
135 A’s, 30 B’s, and so on will cause getLetterCount() to return {'A': 135, 'B': 30,
'C': 74, 'D': 58, 'E': 196, 'F': 37, 'G': 39, 'H': 87, 'I': 139, 'J': 2,
'K': 8, 'L': 62, 'M': 58, 'N': 122, 'O': 113, 'P': 36, 'Q': 2, 'R': 106,
'S': 89, 'T': 140, 'U': 37, 'V': 14, 'W': 30, 'X': 3, 'Y': 21, 'Z': 1}
Line 16 starts the letterCount variable with a dictionary that has all keys with a value of 0.
freqAnalysis.py

18.
19.
20.

for letter in message.upper():
if letter in LETTERS:
letterCount[letter] += 1

The for loop on line 18 iterates through each character in the uppercase version of message.
On line 19, if the character exists in the LETTERS string, we know it is an uppercase letter. In
that case line 20 will increment the value at letterCount[letter].
freqAnalysis.py

22.

return letterCount

After the for loop on line 18 finishes, the letterCount dictionary will have a count of how
often each letter appeared in message. This dictionary is returned from getLetterCount().

The Program’s getItemAtIndexZero() Function

25. def getItemAtIndexZero(x):
26.

The getItemAtIndexZero() function is very simple: it is passed a tuple and returns the
items at index 1. This function will be passed as the key keyword argument for the sort()
method. (The reason for this will be explained later.)

# frequently occurring in the message parameter.
# first, get a dictionary of each letter and its frequency count
letterToFreq = getLetterCount(message)

The getFrequencyOrder() function will return a string with the 26 uppercase letters of the
alphabet arranged in order of how frequently they appear in the message parameter. If
message is readable English instead of random gibberish, this string will most likely be similar
(if not identical to) the string in the ETAOIN constant.
For example, if the “Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician…” text from Chapter
19’s vigenereCipher.py program was passed as a string to getFrequencyOrder(), the
function would return the string 'ETIANORSHCLMDGFUPBWYVKXQJZ' because E is the most
common letter in that paragraph, followed by T, then I, then A, and so on.
This function is somewhat complicated, but it breaks down to five simple steps.
The first step of getFrequencyOrder(), line 34 gets a dictionary value of the letter
frequency count from getLetterCount() for the string in the message parameter. (The
getLetterCount() function was described previously.)
If the “Alan Mathison Turing…” text was passed as a string value for the message parameter,
then line 34 would assign letterToFreq the dictionary value, {'A': 135, 'C': 74,
'B': 30, 'E': 196, 'D': 58, 'G': 39, 'F': 37, 'I': 139, 'H': 87, 'K': 8,
'J': 2, 'M': 58, 'L': 62, 'O': 113, 'N': 122, 'Q': 2, 'P': 36, 'S': 89,
'R': 106, 'U': 37, 'T': 140, 'W': 30, 'V': 14, 'Y': 21, 'X': 3, 'Z': 1}.

# second, make a dictionary of each frequency count to each letter(s)

freqToLetter = {}
for letter in LETTERS:
if letterToFreq[letter] not in freqToLetter:
freqToLetter[letterToFreq[letter]] = [letter]
else:
freqToLetter[letterToFreq[letter]].append(letter)

For the second step of getFrequencyOrder(), while the letterToFreq dictionary has
keys of each of the 26 letters and values of their frequency count, what we need is a dictionary
value that maps the opposite: a dictionary where the keys are the frequency count and values are a
list of letters that appear that many times. While the letterToFreq dictionary maps letter keys

310

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

to frequency values, the freqToLetter dictionary will map frequency keys to list of letter
values.
Line 38 creates a blank dictionary. Line 44 loops over all the letters in LETTERS. The if
statement on line 40 checks if the letter’s frequency (that is, letterToFreq[letter])
already exists as a key in freqToLetter. If not, then line 41 adds this key with a list of the
letter as the value. Or else, line 43 appends the letter to the end of the list that is already at
letterToFreq[letter].
If we continue to use our “Alan Mathison Turing…” example value of letterToFreq then
freqToLetter would end up looking like this: {1: ['Z'], 2: ['J', 'Q'], 3: ['X'],
135: ['A'], 8: ['K'], 139: ['I'], 140: ['T'], 14: ['V'], 21: ['Y'], 30:
['B', 'W'], 36: ['P'], 37: ['F', 'U'], 39: ['G'], 58: ['D', 'M'], 62:
['L'], 196: ['E'], 74: ['C'], 87: ['H'], 89: ['S'], 106: ['R'], 113:
['O'], 122: ['N']}

The sort() Method’s key and reverse Keyword Arguments

# third, put each list of letters in reverse "ETAOIN" order, and then
# convert it to a string
for freq in freqToLetter:
freqToLetter[freq].sort(key=ETAOIN.find, reverse=True)
freqToLetter[freq] = ''.join(freqToLetter[freq])

The third step of getFrequencyOrder() to is sort the letter strings in each list in
freqToLetter in reverse ETAOIN order (as opposed to alphabetical order).
Remember that freqToLetter[freq] will evaluate to a list of letters that have a frequency
count of freq. A list is used because it’s possible that two or more letters have the exact same
frequency count, in which case this list will have two-or-more-letters strings in it.
When multiple letters are tied for frequency, we want these tied letters to be sorted in the reverse
order that they appear in the ETAOIN string. We need this so that we have a consistent way of
breaking ties. Otherwise messages with the same letter frequencies might produce different return
values from getFrequencyOrder()!
For example, if E appears 15 times, D and W appear 8 times each, and H appears 4 times, we
would want them to be sorted as 'EWDH' and not 'EDWH'. This is because while E is the most
frequent, D and W have the same frequency count but W comes after D in the ETAOIN string.

311

Python’s sort() function can do this sorting for us if we pass it a function or method for its
key keyword argument. Normally the sort() function simply sorts the list it is called on into
alphabetical (or numeric) order. However, we can change this by passing the find() method of
the ETAOIN string as the key keyword argument. This will sort the items in the
freqToLetter[freq] list by the integer returned from the ETAOIN.find() method, that
is, the order that they appear in the ETAOIN string.
Normally the sort() method sorts the values in a list in ascending order (that is, lowest to
highest or the letter A first and letter Z last). If we pass True for the sort() method’s
reverse keyword argument, it will sort the items in descending order instead. The reason we
want to sort the letters in reverse ETAOIN order is so that ties result in lower match scores in the
englishFreqMatchScore() function rather than higher match scores. (This function is
explained later.)
If we continue using our “Alan Mathison Turing…” example value for freqToLetter, then
after the loop finishes the value stored in freqToLetter would be: {1: 'Z', 2: 'QJ', 3:
'X', 135: 'A', 8: 'K', 139: 'I', 140: 'T', 14: 'V', 21: 'Y', 30: 'BW', 36:
'P', 37: 'FU', 39: 'G', 58: 'MD', 62: 'L', 196: 'E', 74: 'C', 87: 'H', 89:
'S', 106: 'R', 113: 'O', 122: 'N'}
Notice that the strings for the 30, 37, and 58 keys are all sorted in reverse ETAOIN order.

Passing Functions as Values
freqAnalysis.py

48.

freqToLetter[freq].sort(key=ETAOIN.find, reverse=True)

If you look on line 47, you’ll notice that we are not calling the find() method but instead using
the find method itself as a value that is passed to the sort() method call. In Python, functions
themselves are values just like any other values. For example, try typing this into the interactive
shell:
>>> def foo():
...
print('Hello!')
...
>>> bar = foo
>>> bar()
Hello!

In the above code, we define a function named foo() that prints out the string 'Hello!'. But
this is basically defining a function and then storing it in a variable named foo. Then we copy

312

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

the function in foo to the variable bar. This means we can call bar() just like we can call
foo()! Note that in this assignment statement we do not have parentheses after foo. If we did,
we would be calling the function foo() and setting bar to its return value. Just like spam[42]
has the [42] index operating on spam, the parentheses means, “Call the value in foo as a
function.”
You can also pass functions as values just like any other value. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>>
...
...
>>>
...
...
>>>
...
...
>>>
15
>>>
5
>>>

def doMath(func):
return func(10, 5)
def adding(a, b):
return a + b
def subtracting(a, b):
return a - b
doMath(adding)
doMath(subtracting)

When the function in adding is passed to the doMath() call, the func(10, 5) line is
calling adding() and passing 10 and 5 to it. So the call func(10, 5) is effectively the
same as the call adding(10, 5). This is why doMath(adding) returns 15.
When subtracting is passed to the doMath() call, func(10, 5) is the same as
subtracting(10, 5). This is why doMath(subtracting) returns 5.
Passing a function or method to a function or method call is how the sort() method lets you
implement different sorting behavior. The function or method that is passed to sort() should
accept a single parameter and returns a value that is used to alphabetically sort the item.
To put it another way: normally sort() sorts the values in a list by the alphabetical order of the
list values.. But if we pass a function (or method) for the key keyword argument, then the values
in the list are sorted by the alphabetical or numeric order of the return value of the function when
the value in the list is passed to that function.
You can think of a normal sort() call such as this:

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 20 – Frequency Analysis

313

someListVariable.sort()

…as being equivalent to this:
def func(x):
return x
# sorting based on the value itself
someListVariable.sort(key=func)

So when the sort() method call is passed ETAOIN.find, instead of sorting the strings like
'A', 'B', and 'C' by the alphabetical order the sort() method sorts them by the numeric
order of the integers returned from ETAOIN.find('A'), ETAOIN.find('B'), and
ETAOIN.find('C'): that is, 2, 19, and 11 respectively. So the 'A', 'B', and 'C' strings
get sorted as 'A', 'C', and then 'B' (the order they appear in ETAOIN).

Converting Dictionaries to Lists with the keys(), values(), items()
Dictionary Methods
If you want to get a list value of all the keys in a dictionary, the keys() method will return a
dict_keys object that can be passed to list() to get a list of all the keys. There is a similar
dictionary method named values() that returns a dict_values object. Try typing the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = {'cats': 10, 'dogs': 3, 'mice': 3}
>>> spam.keys()
dict_keys(['mice', 'cats', 'dogs'])
>>> list(spam.keys())
['mice', 'cats', 'dogs']
>>> list(spam.values())
[3, 10, 3]
>>>

Remember, dictionaries do not have any ordering associated with the key-value pairs they
contain. When getting a list of the keys or values, they will be in a random order in the list. If you
want to get the keys and values together, the items() dictionary method returns a dict_items
object that can be passed to list(). The list() function will then return a list of tuples
where the tuples contain a key and value pair of values. Try typing the following into the
interactive shell:
>>> spam = {'cats': 10, 'dogs': 3, 'mice': 3}
>>> list(spam.items())

314

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

[('mice', 3), ('cats', 10), ('dogs', 3)]

We will be using the items() method in our getFrequencyOrder() function, but you
should know about the keys() and values() methods too. Remember, in order to use the
return values from these methods as lists, they must be passed to the list() function. The
list() function then returns a list version of the dict_keys, dict_values, or dict_items object.

Sorting the Items from a Dictionary

53.

# fourth, convert the freqToLetter dictionary to a list of tuple
# pairs (key, value), then sort them
freqPairs = list(freqToLetter.items())

The fourth step of getFrequencyOrder() is to sort the strings from the freqToLetter
dictionary by the frequency count. Remember that the freqToLetter dictionary has integer
frequency counts for the keys and lists of single-letter strings for the values. But since dictionaries
do not have an ordering for the key-value pairs in them, we will call the items() method and
list() function to create a list of tuples of the dictionary’s key-value pairs. This list of tuples
(stored in a variable named freqPairs on line 53) is what we will sort.
freqAnalysis.py

54.

freqPairs.sort(key=getItemAtIndexZero, reverse=True)

The sort() method call is passed the getItemAtIndexZero function value itself. This
means the items in the freqPairs will be sorted by the numeric order of the value at index 0 of
the tuple value, which is the frequency count integer. Line 54 also passes True for the reverse
keyword argument so that the tuples are reverse ordered from largest frequency count to smallest.
If we continue using the previous “Alan Mathison Turing…” example, the value of freqPairs
will be [(196, 'E'), (140, 'T'), (139, 'I'), (135, 'A'), (122, 'N'), (113,
'O'), (106, 'R'), (89, 'S'), (87, 'H'), (74, 'C'), (62, 'L'), (58,
'MD'), (39, 'G'), (37, 'FU'), (36, 'P'), (30, 'BW'), (21, 'Y'), (14,
'V'), (8, 'K'), (3, 'X'), (2, 'QJ'), (1, 'Z')]

60.

# fifth, now that the letters are ordered by frequency, extract all
# the letters for the final string
freqOrder = []
for freqPair in freqPairs:
freqOrder.append(freqPair[1])

The fifth step is to create a list of all the strings from the sorted list in freqPairs. The variable
freqOrder will start as a blank list on line 58, and the string at index 1 of the tuple in
freqPairs will be appended to the end of freqOrder.
If we continue with the “Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician...” example from
before, after this loop has finished, freqOrder will contain the value ['E', 'T', 'I',

316

'V', 'K', 'X', 'QJ', 'Z']
freqAnalysis.py

62.

return ''.join(freqOrder)

Line 62 creates a string from the list of strings in freqOrder by joining them together with the
join() method. If we continue using the previous example, getFrequencyOrder() will
return the string 'ETIANORSHCLMDGFUPBWYVKXQJZ'. According to this ordering, E is the
most frequent letter in the “Alan Mathison Turing…” example string, T is the second most
frequent letter, I is the third most frequent, and so on.

The Program’s englishFreqMatchScore() Function

65. def englishFreqMatchScore(message):

# Return the number of matches that the string in the message

# parameter has when its letter frequency is compared to English

# letter frequency. A "match" is how many of its six most frequent
69.
# and six least frequent letters is among the six most frequent and
70.
# six least frequent letters for English.
71.
freqOrder = getFrequencyOrder(message)

The englishFreqMatchScore() function takes a string for message, and then returns an
integer between 0 and 12 to show message’s frequency match score with readable English’s
letter frequency. The higher the integer, the more that the frequency of the letters in message
matches the frequency of normal English text.
The first step in calculating the match score is to get the letter frequency ordering of message
by calling the getFrequencyOrder() function.

matchScore = 0
# Find how many matches for the six most common letters there are.
for commonLetter in ETAOIN[:6]:
if commonLetter in freqOrder[:6]:
matchScore += 1

The matchScore variable starts off at 0 on line 73. The for loop on line 75 goes through each
of the first 6 letters of the ETAOIN string. Remember that the [:6] slice is the same thing as
[0:6]. If one of these E, T, A, O, I, or N letters is in the first six letters in the freqOrder
string, then line 76’s condition is True and line 77 will increment matchScore.

then matchScore is incremented.

The integer in matchScore is returned on line 83.
The 14 letters in the middle of the frequency ordering are ignored with our frequency match score
calculation. This approach to comparing letter frequencies is pretty simple, but it works well
enough for our hacking program in the next chapter.

The sort() function is useful for sorting the values in a list. Normally sort() will sort them
in alphabetical or numerical order. But the reverse and key keyword arguments can be used to
sort them in different orders. This chapter also explains how functions themselves can be passed
as values in function calls.
Let’s use the frequency analysis module to hack the Vigenère cipher, a cipher that perplexed
cryptanalysts for hundreds of years!

HACKING THE VIGENÈRE CIPHER
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 The extend() list method
 The Set data type and set() function
 The itertools.product() function

Alan says, “When we want to sink a convey, we send out an
observation plane first. It is ostensibly an observation plane. Of
course, to observe is not its real duty—We already know exactly
where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed—That is, to fly
close enough to the convoy that it will be noticed by the lookouts on
the ships. The ships will then send out a radio message to the effect
that they have been sighted by an Allied observation plane. Then,
when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it
suspicious—At least, not quite so monstrously suspicious that we
knew exactly where to go.”
...
Alan says, “Unless we continue to do stunningly idiotic things like
sinking convoys in the fog, they will never receive any clear and
unmistakable indications that we have broken Enigma.”

There are two different methods to hack the Vigenère cipher. The first is a brute-force attack that
tries every word in the dictionary file as the Vigenère key. This method will only work if an
English word like “RAVEN” or “DESK” was used for the key instead of a random key like
“VUWFE” or “PNFJ”. The second is a more sophisticated method that works even if a random
key was used. The earliest record of its use was by the mathematician Charles Babbage in the 19th
century.

The Dictionary Attack
If the Vigenère key is an English word it is very easy to memorize. But never use an English
word for the encryption key. This makes your ciphertext vulnerable to a dictionary attack.
A dictionary attack is a brute-force technique where a hacker attempts to decrypt the ciphertext
using the words from a dictionary file as the keys. The dictionary.txt dictionary file available on
this book’s website (at http://invpy.com/dictionary.txt) has about 45,000 English words. It takes
less than 5 minutes for my computer to run through all of these decryptions for a message the size
of a long paragraph.

Source Code for a Vigenère Dictionary Attack Program
Open a new file editor window by clicking on File ► New Window. Type in the following code
into the file editor, and then save it as vigenereDictionaryHacker.py. Press F5 to run the program.
Note that first you will need to download the pyperclip.py module and place this file in the same
directory as the vigenereDictionaryHacker.py file. You can download this file from

Sample Run of the Vigenère Dictionary Hacker Program
When you run this program the output will look like this:
Possible encryption break:
Key ASTROLOGY: The recl yecrets crk not the qnks I tell.
Enter D for done, or just press Enter to continue breaking:
>
Possible encryption break:
Key ASTRONOMY: The real secrets are not the ones I tell.
Enter D for done, or just press Enter to continue breaking:
> d
Copying hacked message to clipboard:
The real secrets are not the ones I tell.

The first keyword it suggests (“ASTROLOGY”) doesn’t quite work, so the user presses Enter to
let the hacking program continue until it gets the correct decryption key (“ASTRONOMY”).

The readlines() File Object Method
20.

words = fo.readlines()

File objects returned from open() have a readlines() method. Unlike the read() method
which returns the full contents of the file as a single string, the readlines() method will
return a list of strings, where each string is a single line from the file. Note that each of the strings
in the list will end with a \n newline character (except for possibly the very last string, since the
file might not have ended with a newline).
The source code for this program isn’t anything we haven’t seen in previous hacking programs in
this book, aside from the new readlines() method. The hackVigenere() function reads
in the contents of the dictionary file, uses each word in that file to decrypt the ciphertext, and if
the decrypted text looks like readable English it will prompt the user to quit or continue.
As such, we won’t do a line-by-line explanation for this program, and instead continue on with a
program that can hack the Vigenère cipher even when the key was not a word that can be found
in the dictionary.

The Babbage Attack & Kasiski Examination
Charles Babbage is known to have broken the Vigenère cipher, but he never published his results.
Later studies revealed he used a method that was later published by early 20th-century
mathematician Friedrich Kasiski.
“Kasiski Examination” is a process used to determine how long the Vigenère key used to encrypt
a ciphertext was. After this is determined, frequency analysis can be used to break each of the
subkeys.

Kasiski Examination, Step 1 – Find Repeat Sequences’ Spacings
The first part of Kasiski Examination is to find every repeated set of letters at least three letters
long in the ciphertext. These are significant, because they could indicate that they were the same
letters of plaintext encrypted with the same subkeys of the key. For example, if the ciphertext is
“Ppqca xqvekg ybnkmazu ybngbal jon i tszm jyim. Vrag voht vrau c tksg. Ddwuo xitlazu vavv
raz c vkb qp iwpou.” and we remove the non-letters, the ciphertext looks like this:
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLA
ZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU
You can see that the sequences VRA, AZU, and YBN repeat in this ciphertext:

322

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLA
ZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLA
ZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLA
ZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU
After finding the repeated sequences, get a count of the spacing between the sequences. If we
count the number of letters between the start of each of these sequences, we find that:






Between the first and second VRA sequences there are 8 letters.
Between the second and third VRA sequences there are 24 letters.
Between the first and third VRA sequences there are 32 letters.
Between the first and second AZU there are 48 letters.
Between the first and second YBN there are 8 letters.

Kasiski Examination, Step 2 – Get Factors of Spacings
So the spacings are 8, 8, 24, 32, and 48. Let’s find the factors of each of these numbers (not
including one):





The factors of 8 are 2, 4, and 8.
The factors of 24 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.
The factors of 32 are 2, 4, 8, and 16.
The factors of 48 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48.

So the spacings of 8, 8, 24, 32, and 48 expand to this list of factors: 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8,
8, 8, 12, 12, 16, 24, 24, and 48. If we do a count of these factors, we get this:

323

The factors that have the highest count are the most likely lengths of the Vigenère key. In
our example above, these are 2, 4, and 8. The Vigenère key is probably 2, 4, or 8 letters long.

Get Every Nth Letters from a String
For this example, we will guess that the key length is 4. Next we will want to split up the
ciphertext into every 4th letter. This means we want the following underlined letters as a separate
string:
Every 4th letter starting with the first letter:
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLAZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU

Every 4th letter starting with the second letter:
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLAZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU

Every 4th letter starting with the third letter:
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLAZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU

Every 4th letter starting with the fourth lettter:
PPQCAXQVEKGYBNKMAZUYBNGBALJONITSZMJYIMVRAGVOHTVRAUCTKSGDDWUOXITLAZUVAVVRAZCVKBQPIWPOU

When combined, they become these four strings:
Every 4th letter starting with the first letter:
Every 4th letter starting with the second letter:
Every 4th letter starting with the third letter:
Every 4th letter starting with the fourth letter:

PAEBABANZIAHAKDXAAAKIU
PXKNZNLIMMGTUSWIZVZBW
QQGKUGJTJVVVCGUTUVCQP
CVYMYBOSYRORTDOLVRVPO

If our guess from Kasiski Examination was correct and the decryption key was in fact 4
characters long, then the first subkey of the key would have been used to encrypt the characters in
the first string above, the second subkey of the key would have been used to encrypt the
characters in the second string above, and so on.

Frequency Analysis
Remember, the Vigenère cipher is the same as the Caesar cipher, except it uses multiple subkeys.
Kasiski Examination tells us how many subkeys were used for the ciphertext, now we just have to
hack each subkey one at a time. Let’s try to hack the first of these four ciphertext strings:
PAEBABANZIAHAKDXAAAKIU
We will decrypt this string 26 times, once for each of the 26 possible subkeys, and then see what
English frequency match score the decrypted text has. In the table below, the first column is the
subkey used to decrypt the PAEBABANZIAHAKDXAAAKIU string. The second column is the
returned decrypted text value from vigenereCipher.decryptMessage(subkey,

324

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

'PAEBABANZIAHAKDXAAAKIU') where subkey is the subkey from the first column. The
third column is the returned value from
freqAnalysis.englishFreqMatchScore(decryptedText) where
decryptedText is the value from the second column.

The subkeys that produce decryptions with the closest frequency match to English are the ones
that are most likely to be the real subkey. In the above decryptions (for the 1st of the four
ciphertext strings), 'A', 'I', 'N', 'W', and 'X' are the subkeys that have the highest
frequency matches with English. Note that these scores are low in general because there isn’t
enough ciphertext to give us a large sample of text, but it still ends up working well.
We need to repeat this 26-decryptions-and-frequency-match for the other three strings to
find out their most likely subkeys. After this frequency analysis, we find:
The most likely subkeys for the first string are:
The most likely subkeys for the second string are:
The most likely subkey for the third string is:
The most likely subkeys for the fourth string are:

A, I, N, W, and X
I and Z
C
K, N, R, V, and Y

Brute-Force through the Possible Keys
Next we will brute-force the key by trying out every combination of subkey. Because there are 5
possible subkeys for the first subkey, 2 for the second subkey, 1 for the third subkey, and 5 for the
fourth subkey, the number of combinations is 5 × 2 × 1 × 5 or 50 possible keys to brute-force
through. This is much better than the 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 or 456,976 possible keys we would have
to brute-force through if we had not narrowed the list of possible subkeys. This difference
becomes even greater if the Vigenère key had been longer!

Now it’s just a matter of going through all 50 of these decryption keys for the full ciphertext and
seeing which one produces a readable English plaintext. If you do this, you’ll find that the key to
the “Ppqca xqvekg…” ciphertext is “WICK”.

The main() function of the hacking program is similar to the main() functions of previous
hacking functions. The ciphertext is passed to the hackVigenere() cipher, which either
returns the decrypted string (if the hack was successful) or the None value (if the hack failed). If
successful, the hacked message is printed to the screen and copied to the clipboard.

Finding Repeated Sequences
vigenereHacker.py

28. def findRepeatSequencesSpacings(message):
29.
# Goes through the message and finds any 3 to 5 letter sequences
30.
# that are repeated. Returns a dict with the keys of the sequence and
31.
# values of a list of spacings (num of letters between the repeats).
32.
33.
# Use a regular expression to remove non-letters from the message.
34.
message = NONLETTERS_PATTERN.sub('', message.upper())
35.
36.
# Compile a list of seqLen-letter sequences found in the message.
37.
seqSpacings = {} # keys are sequences, values are list of int spacings
38.
for seqLen in range(3, 6):

The findRepeatSequencesSpacings() locates all the repeated sequences of letters in the
message string and counts the spacings (that is, the number of letters) between the sequences.
First, line 34 converts the message to uppercase and removes any non-letter characters from
message using the sub() regular expression method.
The seqSpacings dictionary will have keys of the sequence strings and values of a list with
the integer number of letters between all the occurrences of that sequence in the key. The
previous “PPQCAXQV…” example string from earlier in the “Kasiski Examination, Step 1”
section, if passed as message, would cause findRepeatSequenceSpacings() to return
{'VRA': [8, 24, 32], 'AZU': [48], 'YBN': [8]}.

336

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The code inside line 38’s for loop will find the repeated sequences in message and calculate
the spacings. On the first iteration, it will find sequences that are exactly 3 letters long. On the
next iteration it will find sequences exactly 4 letters long, and then 5 letters long. (You can
change what sequence lengths the code searches for by modifying the range(3, 6) call on
line 38, but finding repeated sequences of length 3, 4 and 5 seems to work for most ciphertexts.)
vigenereHacker.py

39.
40.
41.

for seqStart in range(len(message) - seqLen):
# Determine what the sequence is, and store it in seq
seq = message[seqStart:seqStart + seqLen]

The for loop on line 39 makes sure that we iterate over every possible substring of length
seqLen in the message string. Line 41 sets the seq variable with the sequence we are looking
for. For example, if seqLen is 3 and message is 'PPQCAXQ', we would want to search for the
following sequences (notice the indexes at the top of the 'PPQCAXQ' string):
Table 21-3. Values of seq from message depending on the value in seqStart.
Indexes:
On 1st iteration, seqStart is 0:
On 2nd iteration, seqStart is 1:
On 3rd iteration, seqStart is 2:
On 4th iteration, seqStart is 3:
On 5th iteration, seqStart is 4:

0123456
'PPQCAXQ'
'PPQCAXQ'
'PPQCAXQ'
'PPQCAXQ'
'PPQCAXQ'

(PPQ starts at index 0.)
(PQC starts at index 1.)
(QCA starts at index 2.)
(CAX starts at index 3.)
(AXQ starts at index 4, which is
what len(message) - seqLen
evaluates to and is the last index.)

vigenereHacker.py

43.
44.
45.

# Look for this sequence in the rest of the message
for i in range(seqStart + seqLen, len(message) - seqLen):
if message[i:i + seqLen] == seq:

The for loop on line 44 is inside line 39’s for loop and sets i to be the indexes of every
possible sequence of length seqLen in message. These indexes start at seqStart +
seqLen (that is, after the sequence currently in seq) and go up to len(message) seqLen (which is the last index where a sequence of length seqLen can be found).
The expression message[i:i + seqLen] will evaluate to the substring of message that
gets checked for being a repeat of seq on line 45. If it is, then we need to calculate the spacing
and add it to the seqSpacings dictionary. This is done on lines 46 to 52.

# Found a repeated sequence.
if seq not in seqSpacings:
seqSpacings[seq] = [] # initialize blank list
# Append the spacing distance between the repeated
# sequence and the original sequence.
seqSpacings[seq].append(i - seqStart)

The spacing between the sequence we’ve found at message[i:i + seqLen] and the
original sequence at message[seqStart:seqStart+seqLen] is simply i seqStart. Notice that i and seqStart are the beginning indexes before the colons. So the
integer that i - seqStart evaluates to is the spacing between the two sequences, which is
appended to the list stored at seqSpacings[seq].
(Lines 47 and 48 guarantee there is a list at this key by checking beforehand if seq exists as a
key in seqSpacings. If it does not, then seqSpacings[seq] is set as a key with a blank
list as its value.)
vigenereHacker.py

53.

return seqSpacings

By the time all these for loops have finished, the seqSpacings dictionary will contain every
repeated sequence of length 3, 4, and 5 and their spacings. This dictionary is returned from
findRepeatSequencesSpacings() on line 53.

Calculating Factors
vigenereHacker.py

56. def getUsefulFactors(num):
57.
# Returns a list of useful factors of num. By "useful" we mean factors
58.
# less than MAX_KEY_LENGTH + 1. For example, getUsefulFactors(144)
59.
# returns [2, 72, 3, 48, 4, 36, 6, 24, 8, 18, 9, 16, 12]
60.
61.
if num < 2:
62.
return [] # numbers less than 2 have no useful factors
63.
64.
factors = [] # the list of factors found

The only useful factors for the hacking program’s Kasiski Examination code are of length
MAX_KEY_LENGTH and under, not including 1. The getUsefulFactors() takes a num

338

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

parameter and returns a list of “useful” factors. The function does not necessarily return all the
factors of num in this list.
Line 61 checks for the special case where num is less than 2. In this case, line 62 returns the
empty list because these numbers have no useful factors.
vigenereHacker.py

66.
67.
68.
69.
70.
71.

# When finding factors, you only need to check the integers up to
# MAX_KEY_LENGTH.
for i in range(2, MAX_KEY_LENGTH + 1): # don't test 1
if num % i == 0:
factors.append(i)
factors.append(int(num / i))

The for loop on line 68 loops through the integers 2 up to MAX_KEY_LENGTH (including the
value in MAX_KEY_LENGTH itself, since the second argument to range() is
MAX_KEY_LENGTH + 1).
If num % i is equal to 0, then we know that i evenly divides (that is, has 0 remainder) num and
is a factor of num. In this case, line 70 appends i to the list of factors in the factors variable.
Line 71 also appends num / i (after converting it from a float to an int, since the / operator
always evaluates to a float value).
vigenereHacker.py

72.
73.

if 1 in factors:
factors.remove(1)

The value 1 is not a useful factor, so we remove it from the factors list. (If the Vigenère key
had a length of 1, the Vigenère cipher would be no different from the Caesar cipher!)

Removing Duplicates with the set() Function
vigenereHacker.py

74.

return list(set(factors))

The factors list might contain duplicates. For example, if getUsefulFactors() was
passed 9 for the num parameter, then 9 % 3 == 0 would be True and both i and int(num
/ i) (both of which evaluate to 3) would have been appended to factors. But we don’t want
duplicate numbers to appear in our factors list.
Line 74 passes the list value in factors to set() which returns a set form of the list. The set
data type is similar to the list data type, except a set value can only contain unique values. You

Email questions to the author: al@inventwithpython.com

Chapter 21 – Hacking the Vigenère Cipher

339

can pass a list value to the set() function and it will return a set value form of the list. This set
value will not have any duplicate values in it. If you pass this set value to list(), it will return
a list value version of the set. This is how line 74 removes duplicate values from the factors list.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4])
set([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> spam = list(set([2, 2, 2, 'cats', 2, 2]))
>>> spam
[2, 'cats']
>>>

This list(set(factors)) code is an easy way to remove duplicate factors from the
factors list. The final list value is then returned from the function.
vigenereHacker.py

77. def getItemAtIndexOne(x):
78.
return x[1]

The getItemAtIndexOne() is almost identical to getItemAtIndexZero() from the
freqAnalysis.py program in the previous chapter. This function is passed to sort() to sort based
on the item at index 1 of the items being sorted. (See the “The Program’s
getItemAtIndexZero() Function” section in Chapter 20.)
vigenereHacker.py

81. def getMostCommonFactors(seqFactors):
82.
# First, get a count of how many times a factor occurs in seqFactors.
83.
factorCounts = {} # key is a factor, value is how often if occurs
84.
85.
# seqFactors keys are sequences, values are lists of factors of the
86.
# spacings. seqFactors has a value like: {'GFD': [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12,
87.
# 18, 23, 36, 46, 69, 92, 138, 207], 'ALW': [2, 3, 4, 6, ...], ...}

Remember, we need to know the most common factor of the sequence spacings as a part of the
Kasiski Examination because the most common factor is most likely going to be the length of the
Vigenère key.
The seqFactors parameter is a dictionary value created in the kasiskiExamination()
function, which is explained later. This dictionary has strings of sequences for keys and a list of
integer factors for the value of each key. (These are factors of the spacing integers found by
findRepeatSequencesSpacings().) For example, seqFactors could contain a

340

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

dictionary value like {'VRA': [8, 2, 4, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 8, 2, 4],
'AZU': [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24], 'YBN': [8, 2, 4]}.
The getMostCommonFactors() function will find the most common factors in
seqFactors and return a list of two-integer tuples. The first integer in the tuple will be the
factor and the second integer will be how many times it was in seqFactors.
For example, getMostCommonFactors() may return a list value such as [(3, 556),
(2, 541), (6, 529), (4, 331), (12, 325), (8, 171), (9, 156), (16,
105), (5, 98), (11, 86), (10, 84), (15, 84), (7, 83), (14, 68),
(13, 52)]. This means that in the seqFactors dictionary passed to
getMostCommonFactors(), the factor 3 showed up 556 times, the factor 2 showed up 541
times, the factor 5 showed up 529 times, and so on. Note that 3 is the most frequent factor in the

For the first step of getMostCommonFactors() the for loop on line 88 loops over every

factors in seqFactors for seq is stored in a variable named factorList on line 89.
The factors in this list are looped over with a for loop on line 90. If a factor does not exist as a

For the second step of getMostCommonFactors(), we need to sort the values in the
factorCounts dictionary by their count. But dictionaries do not have an order, so we must
first convert the dictionary into a list of two-integer tuples. (We did something similar in Chapter
20 in the getFrequencyOrder() function of the freqAnalaysis.py module.) This list value
will be stored in a variable named factorsByCount, which starts as an empty list on line 97.
The for loop on line 98 goes through each of the factors in factorCounts and appends this
(factor, factorCounts[factor]) tuple to the factorsByCount list as long as the
factor is less than or equal to MAX_KEY_LENGTH.

# Sort the list by the factor count.
factorsByCount.sort(key=getItemAtIndexOne, reverse=True)
return factorsByCount

After the for loop finishes adding all the tuples to factorsByCount, the last step of
getMostCommonFactors() is that the factorsByCount list is sorted on line 106.
Because the getItemAtIndexOne function is passed for the key keyword argument and
True is passed for the reverse keyword argument, the list is sorted in descending order by the
factor counts.
After being sorted, the list in factorsByCount is returned on line 108.

The Kasiski Examination Algorithm

# Find out the sequences of 3 to 5 letters that occur multiple times

114.
# {'EXG': [192], 'NAF': [339, 972, 633], ... }
115.
repeatedSeqSpacings = findRepeatSequencesSpacings(ciphertext)

The kasiskiExamination() function returns a list of the most likely key lengths for the
given ciphertext argument. The key lengths are integers in a list, with the first integer in the
list being the most likely key length, the second integer the second most likely, and so on.
The first step is to find the spacings between repeated sequences in the ciphertext. This is
returned from findRepeatSequencesSpacings() as a dictionary with keys of the
sequence strings and values of a list with the spacings as integers.

The extend() List Method
The extend() list method is very similar to the append() list method. While the append()
method adds a single value passed to it to the end of the list, the extend() method will add
every item in a list argument to the end of the list. Try typing the following into the interactive
shell:
>>> spam = []
>>> eggs = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']
>>> spam.extend(eggs)
>>> spam
['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']
>>> spam.extend([1, 2, 3])
>>> spam
['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 1, 2, 3]
>>>

Notice the difference if you pass a list to the append() list method. The list itself gets appended
to the end instead of the values in the list:
>>> spam = []
>>> eggs = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']
>>> spam.append(eggs)
>>> spam
[['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']]
>>> spam.append([1, 2, 3])
>>> spam
[['cat', 'dog', 'mouse'], [1, 2, 3]]

While repeatedSeqSpacings is a dictionary that maps sequence strings to lists of integer
spacings, we actually need a dictionary that maps sequence strings to lists of factors of those
integer spacings. Lines 118 to 122 do this.

Line 118 starts with an empty dictionary in seqFactors. The for loop on line 119 iterates
over every key (which is a sequence string) in repeatedSeqSpacings. For each key, line
120 sets a blank list to be the value in seqFactors.
The for loop on line 121 iterates over all the spacing integers, which are each passed to a
getUsefulFactors() call. The list returned from getUsefulFactors() has each of its
items appended to seqFactors[seq].
When all the for loops are finished, seqFactors is a dictionary that maps sequence strings to
lists of factors of integer spacings.

# See getMostCommonFactors() for a description of factorsByCount.

The seqFactors dictionary is passed to getMostCommonFactors() on line 124. A list of
two-integer tuples (the first integer in the tuple being the factor, the second integer being the
count of how often that factor appeared in seqFactors) is returned and stored in
factorsByCount.

allLikelyKeyLengths = []
for twoIntTuple in factorsByCount:
allLikelyKeyLengths.append(twoIntTuple[0])
return allLikelyKeyLengths

The kasiskiExamination() function doesn’t return a list of two-integer tuples though, it
returns a list of integer factors. These integer factors are in the first item of the two-integer tuples
list in factorsByCount, so we need code to pull these integer factors out and put them in a
separate list.
This separate list will be stored in allLikelyKeyLengths, which to begin with is set to an
empty list on line 129. The for loop on line 130 iterates over each of the tuples in
factorsByCount, and appends the tuple’s index 0 item to the end of
allLikelyKeyLengths.

After this for loop completes, the allLikelyKeyLengths variable contains all the factor
integers that were in factorsByCount. This list is returned from
kasiskiExamination().

message = NONLETTERS_PATTERN.sub('', message)

In order to pull out the letters from a ciphertext that were encrypted with the same subkey, we
need a function that can create a string for the 1st, 2nd, or “N th” subkey’s letters from a message.
The first part of getting these letters is to remove the non-letter characters from message using a
regular expression object and its sub() method on line 145. (Regular expressions were first
discussed in Chapter 18’s “A Brief Intro to Regular Expressions and the sub() Regex Method”.)
This letters-only string is stored as the new value in message.

152.

i = n - 1
letters = []
while i < len(message):
letters.append(message[i])
i += keyLength
return ''.join(letters)

Next we will build up a string by appending the letter strings to a list and using the join() list
method to create the final string value. This approach executes much faster than string
concatenation with the + operator. (This approach was first discussed in Chapter 18’s “Building
Strings in Python with Lists” section.)
The i variable will point to the index of the letter in message that we want to append to our
string-building list. This list is stored in a variable named letters. The i variable starts with
the value n - 1 on line 147 and the letters variable starts with a blank list on line 148.
The while loop on line 149 keeps looping while i is less than the length of message. On each
iteration the letter at message[i] is appended to the list in letters. Then i is updated to
point to the next of the subkey’s letters by adding keyLength to i on line 151.

After this loop finishes, the code on line 152 joins the single-letter string values in the letters
list together to form a single string, and this string is returned from
getNthSubkeysLetters().

155. def attemptHackWithKeyLength(ciphertext, mostLikelyKeyLength):
156.
# Determine the most likely letters for each letter in the key.
157.
ciphertextUp = ciphertext.upper()

Recall that our kasiskiExamination() function isn’t guaranteed to return the one true
integer length of the Vigenère key, but rather the function returns a list of several lengths sorted
in order of most likely to be the key length. If our code has guessed the wrong key length, then it
will have to try again with a different key length. The attemptHackWithKeyLength()
function is passed the ciphertext and the key length guess. If successful, this function returns a
string of the hacked message. If the hacking fails, the function returns None.
The hacking code works on uppercase letters but the original string will also be needed, so the
uppercase form of the ciphertext string will be stored in a separate variable named
ciphertextUp.

# allFreqScores is a list of mostLikelyKeyLength number of lists.

for nth in range(1, mostLikelyKeyLength + 1):
162.
nthLetters = getNthSubkeysLetters(nth, mostLikelyKeyLength,
ciphertextUp)

If we assume the value in the mostLikelyKeyLength is the correct key length, the hack
algorithm calls getNthSubkeysLetters() for each subkey and then brute-forces through
the 26 possible letters for each subkey to find the one that produces decrypted text whose letter
frequency closest matches the letter frequency of English.
First, an empty list is stored in allFreqScores on line 160. What this list stores will be
explained a little later.
The for loop on line 161 sets the nth variable to each integer from 1 to the
mostLikelyKeyLength value. (Remember, that when range() is passed two arguments,
the range goes up to, but not including, the second argument. The + 1 is put into the code so that
the integer value in mostLikelyKeyLength itself is included in the range object returned.)

Next, a list of English frequency match scores is stored in a list in a variable named
freqScores. This variable starts as an empty list on line 168 and then the for loop on line
169 loops through each of the 26 uppercase letter from the LETTERS string. The possibleKey
value is used to decrypt the ciphertext by calling vigenereCipher.decryptMessage()
on line 170. The subkey in possibleKey is only one letter, but the string in nthLetters is
made up of only the letters from message that would have been encrypted with that subkey if
we’ve guessed the key length correctly.
The decrypted text is then passed to freqAnalysis.englishFreqMatchScore() to see
how closely the frequency of the letters in decryptedText matches the letter frequency of
regular English. (Remember from the last chapter that the return value will be an integer between
0 and 12, with a higher number meaning a closer match.)
This frequency match score, along with the key used to decrypt, are put into a tuple that is stored
in a variable named keyAndFreqMatchTuple on line 171. This tuple is appended to the end
of freqScores on line 172.

# Sort by match score
freqScores.sort(key=getItemAtIndexOne, reverse=True)

After the for loop on line 169 completes, the freqScores list will contain 26 key-andfrequency-match-score tuples: one tuple for each of the 26 subkeys. We need to sort this so that
the tuples with the largest English frequency match scores are first in the list.
This means that we want to sort by the value at index 1 of the tuples in freqScores and in
reverse (that is, descending) order. We call the sort() method on the freqScores list,

passing the function value getItemAtIndexOne (not calling the function: note the lack of
parentheses) for the key keyword argument. The value True is passed for the reverse
keyword argument to sort in reverse (that is, descending) order.

vigenereHacker.py

176.

allFreqScores.append(freqScores[:NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS])

The NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS constant was set to the integer value 3 on line 9. Once the
tuples in freqScores are sorted, a list containing only the first 3 tuples (that is, the tuples with
the three highest English frequency match scores) is appended to allFreqScores.
After the for loop on line 161 completes, allFreqScores will contain a number of list
values equal to the integer value in mostLikelyKeyLength. (For example, since
mostLikelyKeyLength was 3, allFreqScores would be a list of three lists.) The first
list value will hold the tuples for the top three highest matching subkeys for the first subkey of the
full Vigenère key. The second list value will hold the tuples for the top three highest matching
subkeys for the second subkey of the full Vigenère key, and so on.
Originally, if we wanted to brute-force through the full Vigenère key, there would be (26 ^ key
length) number of possible keys. For example, if the key was ROSEBUD (with a length of 7)
there would be 26 ^ 7 (that is, 8,031,810,176) possible keys.
But by checking the English frequency matching, we’ve narrowed it down to the 4 most likely
letters for each subkey, meaning that there are now only (4 ^ key length) possible keys. Using the
example of ROSEBUD (with a length of 7) for a Vigenère key, now we only need to check 4 ^ 7
(that is, 16,384) possible keys. This is a huge improvement over 8 billion!

for freqScore in allFreqScores[i]:
print('%s ' % freqScore[0], end='')

348

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

At this point, the user might want to know which letters are in the top three most likely list for
each subkey. If the SILENT_MODE constant was set to False, then the code on lines 178 to 184
will print out the values in allFreqScores to the screen.
Whenever the print() function is called, it will print the string passed to it on the screen along
with a newline character. If we want something else printed at the end of the string instead of a
newline character, we can specify the string for the print() function’s end keyword argument.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> print('HEllo', end='\n')
HEllo
>>> print('Hello', end='\n')
Hello
>>> print('Hello', end='')
Hello>>> print('Hello', end='XYZ')
HelloXYZ>>>

(The above was typed into the python.exe interactive shell rather than IDLE. IDLE will always
add a newline character before printing the >>> prompt.)

The itertools.product() Function
The itertools.product() function produces every possible combination of items in a list
or list-like value, such as a string or tuple. (Though the itertools.product() function
returns a “itertools product” object value, this can be converted to a list by passing it to list().)
This combination of things is called a Cartesian product, which is where the function gets its
name. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import itertools
>>> itertools.product('ABC', repeat=4)
<itertools.product object at 0x02C40170>
>>> list(itertools.product('ABC', repeat=4))
[('A', 'A', 'A', 'A'), ('A', 'A', 'A', 'B'), ('A', 'A', 'A', 'C'), ('A', 'A',

As you can see, by passing 'ABC' and the integer 4 for the repeat keyword argument,
itertools.product() returns an “itertools product” object that, when converted to a list,
has tuples of four values with every possible combination of 'A', 'B', and 'C'. (This results in
a list with a total of 3 ^ 4 or 81 tuples in it.)
Since range objects returned from range() are also list-like, they can be passed to
itertools.product() as well. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> import itertools
>>> list(itertools.product(range(8), repeat=5))
[(0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 0, 0, 3), (0, 0, 0,
0, 4), (0, 0, 0, 0, 5), (0, 0, 0, 0, 6), (0, 0, 0, 0, 7), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0), (0,
0, 0, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0, 1, 2), (0, 0, 0, 1, 3), (0, 0, 0, 1, 4),
...skipped for brevity...

7, 2), (7, 7, 7, 7, 3), (7, 7, 7, 7, 4), (7, 7, 7, 7, 5), (7, 7, 7, 7, 6), (7,
7, 7, 7, 7)]

When the range object returned from range(8) is passed to itertools.product() (along
with 5 for the repeat keyword argument), the list that is generated has tuples of 5 values, and
each value are from the integers 0 to 7.
The itertools.product() function is an easy way to generate a list with every possible
combination of some group of values. This is how our hacking program will create integer
indexes to test every possible combination of possible subkeys.

The allFreqScores variable is a list of lists of tuples such that allFreqScores[i] will
evaluate to a list of tuples of possible letters for a single subkey. That is, allFreqScores[0]
has a list of tuples for the first subkey, allFreqScores[1] has a list of tuples for the second
subkey, and so on.
Also, since the NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS constant is set to 4,
itertools.product(range(NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS),
repeat=mostLikelyKeyLength) will cause the for loop to have a tuple of integers (from
0 to 3) for the indexes variable. If 5 was passed for mostLikelyKeyLength, then the
following values would be set to indexes for each iteration:

As the i variable changes for each iteration of the for loop, the value at indexes[i] will be

decryptedText = ''.join(origCase)

Now that we have a complete Vigenère key, lines 197 to 208 will decrypt the ciphertext and
check if the decrypted text is readable English. If it is, then it is printed to the screen for the user
to confirm it is English (since isEnglish() might produce a false positive).
But decryptedText is in all uppercase letters. The code on lines 201 to 207 builds a new
string by appending the origCase list with an uppercase or lowercase form of the letters in
decryptedText. The for loop on line 202 goes through each of the indexes in the
ciphertext string (which, unlike ciphertextUp, has the original casing of the
ciphertext). If ciphertext[i] is uppercase, then the uppercase form of
decryptedText[i] is appended to origCase. Otherwise, the lowercase form of
decryptedText[i] is appended. The list in origCase is then joined together on line 207 to
become the new value of decryptedText.

perform the hacking. The first step is to get the most likely lengths of the Vigenère key based on
Kasiski Examination of ciphertext.
vigenereHacker.py

227.
if not SILENT_MODE:
228.
keyLengthStr = ''
229.
for keyLength in allLikelyKeyLengths:
230.
keyLengthStr += '%s ' % (keyLength)
231.
print('Kasiski Examination results say the most likely key lengths
are: ' + keyLengthStr + '\n')

The likely key lengths are printed to the screen if SILENT_MODE is False.

The break Statement
Similar to how the continue statement is used inside of a loop to continue back to the start of
the loop, the break statement (which is just the break keyword by itself) is used inside of a
loop to immediately exit the loop. When the program execution “breaks out of a loop”, it
immediately moves to the first line of code after the loop ends.
vigenereHacker.py

233.
for keyLength in allLikelyKeyLengths:
234.
if not SILENT_MODE:
235.
print('Attempting hack with key length %s (%s possible
keys)...' % (keyLength, NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS ** keyLength))
236.
hackedMessage = attemptHackWithKeyLength(ciphertext, keyLength)
237.
if hackedMessage != None:
238.
break

For each possible key length, the code calls the attemptHackWithKeyLength() function
on line 236. If attemptHackWithKeyLength() does not return None, then the hack was
successful and the program execution should break out of the for loop on line 238.

keyLength)
251.
if hackedMessage != None:
252.
break

If the hack had failed for all the possible key lengths that kasiskiExamination() returned,
hackedMessage will be set to None when the if statement on line 242 executes. In this case,
all the other key lengths up to MAX_KEY_LENGTH are tried. If Kasiski Examination failed to
calculate the correct key length, then we can just brute-force through the key lengths.
Line 245 starts a for loop that will call attemptHackWithKeyLength() for each value of
keyLength (which ranges from 1 to MAX_KEY_LENGTH) as long as it was not in
allLikelyKeyLengths. (This is because the key lengths in allLikelyKeyLengths
have already been tried in the code on lines 233 to 238.)

Finally, the value in hackedMessage is returned on line 253.

That’s the full Vigenère hacking program. Whether it is successful or not depends on the
characteristics of the ciphertext. Also, the closer the original plaintext’s letter frequency is to
regular English’s letter frequency and the longer the plaintext, the more likely our hacking
program will work.

Practice Exercises, Chapter 21, Set A
Practice exercises can be found at http://invpy.com/hackingpractice21A.

Modifying the Constants of the Hacking Program
There are a few things we can modify if the hacking program doesn’t work though. There are
three constants we set on lines 8 to 10 that affect how our hacking program runs:
vigenereHacker.py

8. MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 16 # will not attempt keys longer than this

If the Vigenère key was longer than the integer in MAX_KEY_LENGTH, there is no possible way
the hacking program will find the correct key. However, if we have MAX_KEY_LENGTH set very
high and the kasiskiExamination() function mistakenly thinks that the key length could
be a very large integer, the program could be spending hours (or days or months) attempting to
hack the ciphertext with wrong key lengths.
Trying to hack the wrong key length that is small is not that big of a problem: it will only take
seconds or minutes to go through the likely keys of that length. If the hacking program fails to
hack the ciphertext, try increasing this value and running the program again.
vigenereHacker.py

9. NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS = 3 # attempts this many letters per subkey

The NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS limits the number of possible letters tried for each subkey.
By increasing this value, the hacking program tries many more keys (which is needed if the
freqAnalysis.englishFreqMatchScore() was inaccurate for the original plaintext
message), but this will also cause the program to slow down. And setting
NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS to 26 will cause the program to not narrow down the number of
possible letters for each subkey at all!
Table 21-5. Tradeoffs for the MAX_KEY_LENGTH and NUM_MOST_FREQ_LETTERS.
Smaller value: Larger value:
Faster to execute. Slower to execute.

10. SILENT_MODE = False # if set to True, program doesn't print attempts

While your computer can perform calculations very fast, displaying characters on the screen is
relatively slow. If you want to speed up your program, you can set SILENT_MODE to True so
that the program does not waste time printing information to the screen. On the downside, you
will not know how the program is doing until it has completely finished running.

Summary
Hacking the Vigenère cipher requires several detailed steps to follow. There are also many parts
where our hacking program could fail: perhaps the Vigenère key used for encryption was larger
in length than MAX_KEY_LENGTH, or perhaps the English frequency matching function got
inaccurate results because the plaintext doesn’t follow normal letter frequency, or maybe the
plaintext has too many words that aren’t in our dictionary file and isEnglish() doesn’t
recognize it as English.
If you identify different ways that the hacking program could fail, you could change the code to
become ever more sophisticated to handle these other cases. But the hacking program in this book
does a pretty good job at reducing billions or trillions of possible keys to brute-force through to
mere thousands.
However, there is one trick to make the Vigenère cipher mathematically impossible to break, no
matter how powerful your computer or how clever your hacking program is. We’ll learn about
these “one-time pads” in the next chapter.

356

THE ONE-TIME PAD CIPHER
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 The Unbreakable One-Time Pad Cipher
 The Two-Time Pad is the Vigenère Cipher

“I’ve been over it a thousand times,” Waterhouse
says, “and the only explanation I can think of is
that they are converting their messages into large
binary numbers and then combining them with
other large binary numbers —one-time pads, most
likely —to produce the ciphertext.”
“In which case your project is doomed," Alan says,
"because you can't break a one-time pad.”
“Cryptonomicon” by Neal Stephenson

357

The Unbreakable One-Time Pad Cipher
There is one cipher that is impossible to crack, no matter how powerful your computer is, how
much time you have to crack it, or how clever of a hacker you are. We won’t have to write a new
program to use it either. Our Vigenère program can implement this cipher without any changes.
But this cipher is so inconvenient to use on a regular basis that it is often only used for the most
top-secret of messages.
The one-time pad cipher is an unbreakable cipher. It is a Vigenère cipher where:
1. The key is exactly as long as the message that is encrypted.
2. The key is made up of truly random symbols.
3. The key is used one time only, and never used again for any other message.
By following these three rules, your encrypted message will be invulnerable to any cryptanalyst’s
attack. Even with literally an infinite amount of computing power, the cipher cannot be broken.
The key for the one-time pad cipher is called a pad because they were printed on pads of paper.
The top sheet of paper would be torn off the pad after it was used to reveal the next key to use.

Why the One-Time Pad is Unbreakable
To see why the one-time pad (OTP) cipher is unbreakable, let’s think about why the regular
Vigenère cipher is vulnerable to breaking. Our Vigenère cipher hacking program works by doing
frequency analysis. But if the key is the same length as the message, then every possible
ciphertext letter is equally probable to be for the same plaintext letter.
Say that we want to encrypt the message, “If you want to survive out here, you've got to know
where your towel is.” If we remove the spaces and punctuation, this message has 55 letters. So to
encrypt it with a one-time pad, we need a key that is also 55 letters long. Let’s use the key
“kcqyzhepxautiqekxejmoretzhztrwwqdylbttvejmedbsanybpxqik”. Encrypting the string looks like
this:
Plaintext ifyouwanttosurviveouthereyouvegottoknowwhereyourtowelis
Key kcqyzhepxautiqekxejmoretzhztrwwqdylbttvejmedbsanybpxqik
Ciphertext shomtdecqtilchzssixghyikdfnnmacewrzlghraqqvhzguerplbbqc
Now imagine a cryptanalyst got a hold of the ciphertext (“shomtdec...”). How could she attack
the cipher? Brute-forcing through the keys would not work, because there are too many even for a
computer. The number of keys is 26 ^ (number of letters in the message), so if the message has 55
letters, there would be a total of 26 ^ 55, or 666,091,878,431,395,624,153,823,182,526,730,590,
376,250,379,52 8,249,805,353,030,484,209,594,192,101,376 possible keys.

358

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

But it turns out that even if she had a computer that was powerful enough to try all the keys, it
still would not break the one-time pad cipher. This is because for any ciphertext, all possible
plaintext messages are equally likely.
For example, given the ciphertext “shomtdec...”, we could easily say the original plaintext was
“The myth of Osiris was of importance in ancient Egyptian religion.” encrypted with the key
“zakavkxolfqdlzhwsqjbzmtwmmnakwurwexdcuywksgorghnnedvtcp”:
Plaintext
Key

themythofosiriswasofimportanceinancientegyptianreligion
zakavkxolfqdlzhwsqjbzmtwmmnakwurwexdcuywksgorghnnedvtcp
shomtdecqtilchzssixghyikdfnnmacewrzlghraqqvhzguerplbbqc

The way we are able to hack encryption is because there is usually only one key that can be used
to decrypt the message to sensible English. But we’ve just shown that the same ciphertext could
have been made from two very different plaintext messages. For the one-time pad, the
cryptanalyst has no way of telling which was the original message. In fact, any readable English
plaintext message that is exactly 55 letters long is just as likely to be the original plaintext. Just
because a certain key can decrypt the ciphertext to readable English does not mean it was
the original encryption key.
Since any English plaintext could have been used to create a ciphertext with equal likelihood, it is
completely impossible to hack a message encrypted with a one-time pad.

Beware Pseudorandomness
The random module that comes with Python does not generate truly random numbers. They are
computed from an algorithm that creates numbers that only appear random (which is often good
enough). If the pad is not generated from a truly random source, then it loses its mathematicallyperfect secrecy.
The os.urandom() function can provide truly random numbers but is a bit more difficult to
use. For more information about this function, see http://invpy.com/random.

Beware the Two-Time Pad
If you do use the same one-time pad key to encrypt two different messages, you have introduced
a weakness into your encryption. Using the one-time pad cipher this way is sometimes called a
“two-time pad cipher”. It’s a joke name though, the two-time pad cipher is really just using the
one-time pad cipher incorrectly.
Just because a key decrypts the one-time pad ciphertext to readable English does not mean it is
the correct key. However, if you use the same key for two different messages, now the hacker can

know that if a key decrypts the first ciphertext to readable English, but that same key decrypts the
second message to random garbage text, it must not be the original key. In fact, it is highly likely
that there is only one key that will decrypt both messages to English.
If the hacker only had one of the two messages, then it is still perfectly encrypted. But, you must
always assume that all of your encrypted messages are being intercepted by hackers and/or
governments (otherwise, you wouldn’t need to bother encrypting your messages.) Remember
Shannon’s Maxim: The enemy knows the system! This includes knowing the ciphertext.

The Two-Time Pad is the Vigenère Cipher
To see why the two-time pad is hackable just like the Vigenère Cipher, let’s think about how the
Vigenère cipher works when it encrypts a message that is longer than the key. Once we run out of
characters in the key to encrypt with, we go back to the first character of the key and continue
encrypting. So to encrypt a 20-character message like “AABBCCDDEEVVWWXXYYZZ” with
a 10-character long key such as “PRECOCIOUS”, the first ten characters (AABBCCDDEE) are
encrypted with “PRECOCIOUS” and then the next ten characters (VVWWXXYYZZ) are also
encrypted with “PRECOCIOUS”.
Plaintext
Vigenère Key
Vigenère Ciphertext

AABBCCDDEEVVWWXXYYZZ
PRECOCIOUSPRECOCIOUS
PRFDQELRYWKMAYLZGMTR

We have already learned how to break Vigenère ciphers. If we can show that a two-time pad
cipher is the same thing as a Vigenère cipher, then we can prove that it is breakable using the
same techniques used to break Vigenère cipher.
Using the one-time pad cipher, let’s say the 10-character message “AABBCCDDEE” was
encrypted with the one-time pad key “PRECOCIOUS”. Then the cryptographer makes the
mistake of encrypting a second 10-character message “VVWWXXYYZZ” with the same onetime pad key, “PRECOCIOUS”.
Plaintext
One-Time Pad Key
One-Time Pad Ciphertext

Message 1
Message 2
AABBCCDDEE VVWWXXYYZZ
PRECOCIOUS PRECOCIOUS
PRFDQELRYW KMAYLZGMTR

If we compare the ciphertext of the Vigenère cipher and the ciphertexts of the one-time pad
cipher, we can see they are the exact same. The two-time pad cipher has the same properties as
the Vigenère cipher, which means that the same techniques could be used to hack it!
This also tells us that if we do the Vigenère cipher but use a key that is as long as the message it
is encrypting (and only use this key once for this message), then it will be perfectly unbreakable.

360

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

This is why we don’t need to write a separate one-time pad cipher program. Our Vigenère cipher
program already does it!

Practice Exercises, Chapter 22, Set A
Practice exercises can be found at http://invpy.com/hackingpractice22A.

Summary
In short, a one-time pad is just the Vigenère cipher with a key that is the same length as the
message and is only used once. As long as these two conditions are followed, it is literally
impossible to break the one-time pad. However, it is so inconvenient to use the one-time pad that
it is not generally used except for the most top-secret of secrets. Usually a large list of one-time
pad keys are generated and shared in person, with the keys marked for specific dates. This way, if
you receive a message from your collaborator on October 31st, you can just look through the list
of one-time pads to find the one for that day. But be sure this list doesn’t fall into the wrong
hands!

FINDING PRIME NUMBERS
Topics Covered In This Chapter:
 Prime and Composite Numbers
 The Sieve of Eratosthenes
 The Rabin-Miller Primality Test

“Mathematicians have tried in vain to this day to
discover some order in the sequence of prime
numbers, and we have reason to believe that it is a
mystery into which the human mind will never
penetrate.”
Leonhard Euler, 18th century mathematician

All of the ciphers described in this book so far have been around for hundreds of years, and all of
them (with the exception of the one-time pad) are easily broken by computers. These ciphers
worked very well when hackers had to rely on pencil and paper to hack them, but computers can
now manipulate data trillions of times faster than a person with a pencil.
The RSA cipher has several improvements over these old ciphers, and it will be detailed in the
next chapter. However, the RSA cipher will require us to learn about prime numbers first.

362

Prime Numbers
A prime number is an integer (that is, a whole number) that is greater than 1 and has only two
factors: 1 and itself. Remember that the factors of a number are the numbers that can be
multiplied to equal the original number. The numbers 3 and 7 are factors of 21. The number 12
has factors 2 and 6, but also 3 and 4.
Every number has factors of 1 and itself. The numbers 1 and 21 are factors of 21. The numbers 1
and 12 are factors of 12. This is because 1 times any number will always be that same number.
But if no other factors exist for that number, then that number is prime.
Here’s a list of prime numbers (note that 1 is not considered a prime number):
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103,
107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199,
211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281 …and so on, FOREVER.
There are an infinite number of prime numbers. This means there is no “largest” prime. They just
keep getting bigger and bigger, just like regular numbers do. (See http://invpy.com/infiniteprimes
for a proof of this.) The RSA cipher makes use of very large prime numbers in the keys it uses.
Because of this, there will be far too many keys to brute-force through.
A googol is the number that has a one with a hundred zeros behind it:
10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00
0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
(As a bit of history: the name of the search engine company Google came from misspelling
“googol”, but they decided they liked that spelling better and kept it.)
A billion billion billion googols has twenty-seven more zeros than a googol:
10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00
0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
But these are tiny numbers. A typical prime number used in our RSA program will have hundreds
of digits:
112,829,754,900,439,506,175,719,191,782,841,802,172,556,768,253,593,054,977,186,2355,84,9

The above number is so big, I’m going to guess you didn’t even read it to notice the typo in it.

Composite Numbers
Integers that are not prime numbers are called composite numbers, because they are composed
of at least two factors besides 1 and the number itself. They are called composite numbers
because these number are composed of prime numbers multiplied together, such as the composite
number 1,386 being composed of the prime numbers in 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 11.
Here are four facts about prime numbers:
1. Prime numbers are integers greater than 1that have only 1 and themselves as factors.
2. Two is the only even prime number. (Though I guess that makes two a very odd
prime number.)
3. There are an infinite number of prime numbers. There is no “largest prime number”.
4. Multiplying two prime numbers will give a number that only has two pairs of
factors, 1 and itself (like all numbers do), and the two prime numbers that were
multiplied. For example, 3 and 7 are prime numbers. 3 times 7 is 21. The only
factors for 21 are 1, 21, 3, and 7.

Source Code for The Prime Sieve Module
First we will create a module that has functions related to prime numbers:


isPrime() will return either True or False if the number passed to it is prime or not. It will
use the “divides test” algorithm.
primeSieve() will use the “Sieve of Eratosthenes” algorithm (explained later) to generate
numbers.



Like cryptomath.py, the primeSieve.py program is only meant to be imported as a module to our
other programs. It does not do anything when run on its own.

into the file editor, and then save it as primeSieve.py.

A prime number has no factors besides 1 and itself. So to find out if a given number is prime or
not, we just have to keep dividing it by integers and see if any of them evenly divide the number
with 0 remainder.
The math.sqrt() function will return a float value of the square root of the number it is
passed. The square root of a number can be multiplied by itself to get the number. For example,
the square root of 49 is 7, because 7 × 7 is 49.
For example, to find out if 49 is prime, divide it by the integers starting with 2:
49 ÷ 2 = 24 remainder 1
49 ÷ 3 = 16 remainder 1
49 ÷ 4 = 12 remainder 1
49 ÷ 5 = 9 remainder 4
49 ÷ 6 = 8 remainder 1

49 ÷ 7 = 7 remainder 0
Actually, you only need to divide the number by prime numbers. For example, there’s no reason
to see if 6 divides 49, because if it did then 2 would have divided 49 since 2 is a factor of 6. Any
number that 6 divides evenly can also be divided by 2 evenly:

Figure 23-1. 2 divides 6, and 6 divides X, therefore 2 divides X.
Because there’s an integer (that is not 1 or 49) that evenly divides 49 (that is, has a remainder of
0), we know that 49 is not a prime number. For another example, let’s try 13:
13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1
13 ÷ 3 = 4 remainder 1
13 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 1
No integer divides 13 with a remainder of 0 (except for 1 and 13, which don’t count). Actually,
we don’t even have to divide all the numbers up to 13. We only have to test the integers up to
(and including) the square root of the number we are testing for primality. The square root of a
number is the number that is multiplied by itself to get that first number. The square root of 25 is
5, because 5 × 5 = 25. The square root of 13 is about 3.6055512754639, because
3.6055512754639 × 3.6055512754639 = 13. This means that when we were testing 13 for
primality, we only had to divide 2 and 3 because 4 is larger than the square root of 13.
Line 18 checks if the remainder of division is 0 by using the % mod operator. If line 17’s for
loop never returns False, the function will return True on line 20.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes
The sieve of Eratosthenes (pronounced “era, taws, thuh, knees”) is an algorithm for calculating
prime numbers. Imagine a bunch of boxes for each integer, all marked “prime”:

Mark 1 as “Not Prime” (since one is never prime). Then mark all the multiples of two (except for
two itself) as “Not Prime”. This means we will mark the integers 4 (2 × 2), 6 (2 × 3), 8 (2 × 4),
10, 12, and so on up to 50 (the largest number we have) are all marked as “Not Prime”:

Then repeat this with all the multiples of three, except for three itself: 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and so

itself), and all of the multiples of five (except for five itself), up until eight. We stop at 8 because

By using the sieve of Erastothenes, we’ve calculated that the prime numbers under 50 are 2, 3, 5,
7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. This sieve algorithm is good when we want to
quickly find out all the prime numbers in a certain range of numbers. It is much faster than using
the previous “divides test” algorithm to test if 2 is prime, then test if 3 is prime, then test if 4 is
prime, and so on.

The primeSieve() Function
23. def primeSieve(sieveSize):
24.
# Returns a list of prime numbers calculated using
25.
# the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
26.
27.
sieve = [True] * sieveSize
28.
sieve[0] = False # zero and one are not prime numbers
29.
sieve[1] = False

The primeSieve() function returns a list of all prime numbers between 1 and sieveSize.
First, line 27 creates a list of Boolean True values that is the length of sieveSize. The 0 and
1 indexes are marked as False because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

# create the sieve
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(sieveSize)) + 1):
pointer = i * 2
while pointer < sieveSize:
sieve[pointer] = False
pointer += i

The for loop on line 32 goes through each integer from 2 up to the square root of sieveSize.
The variable pointer will start at the first multiple of i after i (which will be i * 2). Then
the while loop will set the pointer index in the sieve list to False, and line 36 will
change pointer to point to the next multiple of i.

# compile the list of primes
primes = []
for i in range(sieveSize):
if sieve[i] == True:
primes.append(i)

After the for loop on line 32 completes, the sieve list will contain True for each index that is
a prime number. We can create a new list (which starts as an empty list in primes) and loop over
the entire sieve list, and appends and numbers if sieve[i] is True (meaning i is prime).
44.

return primes

The list of prime numbers is returned on line 44.

Detecting Prime Numbers
The isPrime() function in primeSieve.py checks if the number can be divided evenly by a
range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. But what about a number like
1,070,595,206,942,983? If you pass this integer to isPrime(), it takes several seconds to
determine if it is prime or not. And if the number is hundreds of digits long (like the prime
numbers in next chapter’s RSA cipher program are), it would take over a trillion years to figure
out if that one number is prime or not.
The isPrime() function in primeSieve.py is too slow for the large numbers we will use in the
RSA cipher. Fortunately there is an algorithm called the Rabin-Miller Primality Test than can
calculate if such large numbers are prime or not. We will create a new isPrime() function in
rabinMiller.py that makes use of this better algorithm.

The code for this algorithm uses advanced mathematics, and how the algorithm works is beyond
the scope of this book. Like the gcd() function in cryptomath.py, this book will just present the
code for the algorithm for you to use without explanation.

Source Code for the Rabin-Miller Module
Open a new file editor window and type in the following code. Save this file as rabinMiller.py.
This program will be a module that is meant to be imported by other programs.
Instead of typing out the list of numbers on line 43, just temporarily add the lines import
pyperclip and pyperclip.copy(primeSieve(1000)) in the primeSieve.py file and
run it. This will copy the list of primes to the clipboard, and then you can paste it into the
rabinMiller.py file.
Open a new file editor window by clicking on File ► New Window. Type in the following code
into the file editor, and then save it as rabinMiller.py.

The mathematics of the Rabin-Miller Primality algorithm are beyond the scope of this book, so
the code in this function will not be explained.
The Rabin-Miller algorithm is also not a surefire test for primality; however, you can be
extremely certain that it is accurate. (Although this is not good enough for commercial encryption
software, it is good enough for the purposes of the programs in this book.) The main benefit of
the Rabin-Miller algorithm is that it is a relatively simple primality test and only takes a few
seconds to run on a normal computer.
If rabinMiller() returns True, then the num argument is extremely likely to be prime. If
rabinMiller() returns False, then num is definitely composite.

we can immediately return False.

if num in lowPrimes:

The numbers in the lowPrimes list are primes. (Duh.) We can immediately return True if num
is in the lowPrimes list.

51.

# See if any of the low prime numbers can divide num
for prime in lowPrimes:
if (num % prime == 0):
return False

Line 49 loops through each of the prime numbers in the lowPrimes list. The integer in num is
modded with the % mod operator by each prime number on line 50, and if this evaluates to 0 then
we know that prime divides num and so num is not prime. In that case, line 51 returns False.
Checking if num is divisible by all the primes under 1000 won’t tell us if the number is prime, but
it might tell us if the number is composite. About 30% of the random numbers that
generateLargePrime() creates that are composite will be detected as composite by
dividing by the low prime numbers. Dividing by the low prime numbers is much faster than
executing the full Rabin-Miller algorithm on the number, so this shortcut can make our program
execute much more quickly.

# If all else fails, call rabinMiller() to determine if num is a prime.

Those are all the quick tests to determine if a number is prime or not. But if num does not match
any of those tests, then it is passed to the rabinMiller() function to check if it is prime or
not. The return value of rabinMiller() will be returned by isPrime().
The comment on line 53 means call the rabinMiller() function to determine if the number is
prime. Please do not call Dr. Rabin or Dr. Miller personally to ask them if your number is prime.

60.
num = random.randrange(2**(keysize-1), 2**(keysize))
61.
if isPrime(num):
62.
return num

The generateLargePrime() function will return an integer that is prime. It does this by
coming up with a large random number, storing it in num, and then passing num to isPrime().
The isPrime() function will then test to see if num is composite and then pass the num to
rabinMiller() for a more thorough (and computationally expensive) primality test.
If the number num is prime, then line 62 returns num. Otherwise the infinite loop goes back to
line 60 to try a new random number. This loop keeps trying over and over again until it finds a
number that the isPrime() function says is prime.

Summary
Prime numbers have fascinating properties in mathematics. As you will learn in the next chapter,
they are also the backbone of ciphers used in actual professional encryption software. The
definition of a prime number is simple enough: a number that only has one and itself as factors.
But determining which numbers are prime and which are composite (that is, not prime) takes
some clever code.
Modding a number with all the numbers from two up to the square root of the number is how our
isPrime() function determines if that number is prime or not. A prime number will never have
a remainder of 0 when it is modded by any number (besides its factors, 1 and itself.) But this can
take a while for the computer to calculate when testing large numbers for primality.
The sieve of Erastothenes can be used to quickly tell if a range of numbers is prime or not, but
this requires a lot of memory.
The RSA cipher makes use of extremely large prime numbers that are hundreds of digits long.
The Sieve of Erastothenes and the basic isPrime() function we have in primeSieve.py aren’t
sophisticated enough to handle numbers this large.
The Rabin-Miller algorithm uses some mathematics which has simple code (but the mathematical
reasoning behind it is too complex for this book), but it allows us to determine if a number that is
hundreds of digits long is prime.

In the next chapter, we will use the prime number code we developed for the rabinMiller.py
module in our RSA Cipher program. At last, we will have a cipher easier to use than the one-time
pad cipher but that cannot be hacked by the simple hacker techniques in this book!

Warning to Time Travelers:

Should you travel back to the early 1990’s with this book, the contents of Chapter 24 would be
illegal to possess in the United States. Strong crypto (that is, cryptography strong enough not to
be hacked) was regulated at the same level as tanks, missiles, and flamethrowers and the export of
encryption software would require State Department approval. They said that this was a matter of
national security.
Daniel J. Bernstein, a student at the University of California, Berkeley at the time, wanted to
publish an academic paper and associated source code on his “Snuffle” encryption system. He
was told by the U.S. government that he would first need to become a licensed arms dealer before
he could post his source code on the Internet. They also told him that they would deny him an
export license if he actually applied for one, because his technology was too secure.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, in its second major case as a young digital civil liberties
organization, brought about the Bernstein v. United States court cases. The court ruled, for the
first time ever, that written software code is speech protected by the First Amendment, and that
the export control laws on encryption violated Bernstein’s First Amendment rights by prohibiting
his constitutionally protected speech.
Today, strong crypto is used to safeguard businesses and e-commerce used by millions of Internet
shoppers everyday. Cryptography is at the foundation of a large part of the global economy. But
in the 1990’s, spreading this knowledge freely (as this book does) would have landed you in
prison for arms trafficking.
A more detailed history of the legal battle for cryptography can be found in Steven Levy’s book,
Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government, Saving Privacy in the Digital Age.

The fears and predictions made by the “experts” of the intelligence community that encryption
software would become a grave national security threat turned out to be… less than well-founded.

something no one else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it, and maybe I
break it. I’m real happy with myself, ‘cause I did my job well. But maybe
that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the

Now the politicians are saying ‘Oh, send in the Marines to secure the
area,’ ‘cause they don’t give a shit. It won’t be their kid over there getting
shot just like it wasn’t them when their number got called ‘cause they
were pulling a tour in the National Guard. It’ll be some kid from Southie
over there taking shrapnel in the ass. He comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from, and
the guy that put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, ‘cause he’ll work
for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
Meanwhile he realizes that the only reason he was over there in the first
place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good
price. And of course the oil companies use the little skirmish to scare up
domestic oil prices, a cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain’t
helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. They’re taking their sweet time
bringing the oil back, of course, and maybe they took the liberty of hiring
an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fucking play slalom
with the icebergs. It ain’t too long until he hits one, spills the oil, and kills
all the sea life in the North Atlantic.
So now my buddy’s out of work, he can’t afford to drive, so he’s walking
to the fucking job interviews which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass
is giving him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he’s starving ‘cause
any time he tries to get a bite to eat the only Blue Plate Special they’re
serving is North Atlantic Scrod with Quaker State.
So what did I think? I’m holding out for something better.”

Public Key Cryptography
All of the ciphers in this book so far have one thing in common: the key used for encryption is the
same key used for decryption. This leads to a tricky problem: How do you share encrypted
messages with someone you’ve never talked to before?

380

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Say someone on the other side of the world wants to communicate with you. But you both know
that spy agencies are monitoring all emails, letters, texts, and calls that you send. You could send
them encrypted messages, however you would both have to agree on a secret key to use. But if
one of you emailed the other a secret key to use, then the spy agency would be able to see this key
and then decrypt any future messages you send with that key. Normally you would both secretly
meet in person and exchange the key then. But you can’t do this if the person is on the other side
of the world. You could try encrypting the key before you send it, but then you would have to
send the secret key for that message to the other person and it would also be intercepted.
This is a problem solved by public key cryptography. Public key cryptography ciphers have
two keys, one used for encryption and one used for decryption. A cipher that uses different keys
for encryption and decryption is called an asymmetric cipher, while the ciphers that use the
same key for encryption and decryption (like all the previous ciphers in this book) are called
symmetric ciphers.
The important thing to know is that a message encrypted with one key can only be decrypted
with the other key. So even if someone got their hands on the encryption key, they would not be
able to read an encrypted message because the encryption key can only encrypt; it cannot be used
to decrypt messages that it encrypted.
So when we have these two keys, we call one the public key and one the private key. The public

key is shared with the entire world. However, the private key must be kept secret.
If Alice wants to send Bob a message, Alice finds Bob’s public key (or Bob can give it to her).
Then Alice encrypts her message to Bob with Bob’s public key. Since the public key cannot
decrypt a message that was encrypted with it, it doesn’t matter that everyone else has Bob’s
public key.
When Bob receives the encrypted message, he uses his private key to decrypt it. If Bob wants to
reply to Alice, he finds her public key and encrypts his reply with it. Since only Alice knows her
own private key, Alice will be the only person who can decrypt the encrypted message.
Remember that when sending encrypted messages using a public key cipher:
 The public key is used for encrypting.
 The private key is used for decrypting.
To go back to the example of communicating with someone across the world, now it doesn’t
matter if you send them your public key. Even if the spy agency has your public key, they cannot
read messages that were encrypted with the public key. Only your private key can decrypt those
messages, and you keep that key a secret.

Chapter 24 – Public Key Cryptography and the RSA Cipher

381

The particular public key cipher that we will implement is called the RSA cipher, which was
invented in 1977 and named after its inventors: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman.

The Dangers of “Textbook” RSA
While we don’t write a hacking program for the RSA cipher program in this book, don’t make the
mistake of thinking the rsaCipher.py program featured in this chapter is secure. Getting
cryptography right is very hard and requires a lot of experience to know if a cipher (and a
program that implements it) is truly secure.
The RSA program in this chapter is known as textbook RSA because, while it does implement
the RSA algorithm correctly using large prime numbers, there are several subtle faults with it that
can lead to its encrypted messages being hacked. The difference between pseudorandom and truly
random number generation functions is one such fault. But there are many others.
So while you might not be able to hack the ciphertext created by rsaCipher.py, don’t think that no
one else can. The highly accomplished cryptographer Bruce Schneier once said, “Anyone, from
the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself can’t
break. It’s not even hard. What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break, even
after years of analysis. And the only way to prove that is to subject the algorithm to years of
analysis by the best cryptographers around.”
The program in this book is a fun example, but stick to professional encryption software to secure
your files. You can find a list of (usually free) encryption software here:
http://invpy.com/realcrypto.

A Note About Authentication
There is a slight problem with public key ciphers. Imagine you got an email that said this:
“Hello. I am Emmanuel Goldstein, leader of the resistance. I would
like to communicate secretly with you about very important matters.
Attached is my public key.”
Using the public key, you can be sure that the messages you send cannot be read by anyone other
than “Emmanuel Goldstein”. But how do you know the person who sent you this is actually
Emmanuel Goldstein? Maybe it is Emmanuel Goldstein that you are sending encrypted messages
to, or maybe it is a spy agency that is pretending to be Emmanuel Goldstein to lure you into a
trap.

382

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

So while public key ciphers (and, in fact, all the ciphers in this book) can provide
confidentiality (that is, keeping the message a secret), they don’t provide authentication (that
is, proof that who you are communicating with really is who they say they are).
Normally this isn’t a problem with symmetric ciphers, because when you exchange keys with the
person you can see them for yourself. However, you don’t need to see a person in order to get
their public key and begin sending them encrypted messages. This is something to keep in mind
when using public key cryptography.
There is an entire field called PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) that deals with authentication so
that you can match public keys to people with some level of security; however, PKI is beyond the
scope of this book.

The Man-In-The-Middle Attack
Even more insidious than hacking our encrypted messages is a man-in-the-middle attack. Say
Emmanuel Goldstein really did want to communicate with you and sent you the above message,
but the spy agency intercepted it. They could then replace the public key Emmanuel attached to
the email with their own public key, and then send it on to you. You would think the spy agency’s
key was Emmanuel’s key!
Now when you encrypt a reply to Emmanuel, they intercept that message, decrypt it (since you
really encrypted the message with the spy agency’s public key, not Emmanuel’s public key) and
read it, and then they re-encrypt it with Emmanuel’s actual public key and send it to him. They do
the same thing with any messages that Emmanuel sends to you.

Figure 24-1. A man-in-the-middle attack.

Chapter 24 – Public Key Cryptography and the RSA Cipher

383

To both you and Emmanuel, it looks like you are communicating secretly with each other. But
actually, the spy agency is doing a man-in-the-middle attack and reading all of your messages.
You and Emmanuel are actually encrypting your messages public keys generated by the spy
agency! Again, this problem is caused by the fact that the public key cipher only provides
confidentiality, but does not provide authentication.

Generating Public and Private Keys
A key in the RSA scheme is made of two numbers. There are three steps to creating the keys:
1. Create two random, very large prime numbers. These numbers will be called p and q.
Multiply these numbers to get a number which we will call n.
2. Create a random number, called e, which is relatively prime with (p – 1) × (q – 1).
3. Calculate the modular inverse of e. This number will be called d.
The public key will be the two numbers n and e. The private key will be the two numbers n and d.
(Notice that both keys have the number n in them.) We will cover how to encrypt and decrypt
with these numbers when the RSA cipher program is explained. First let’s write a program to
generate these keys.

These two keys are written out to two different files, al_sweigart_pubkey.txt and

passed to the makeKeyFiles() function. You can specify a different filenames by passing a
different string. These key files will be used by the RSA cipher program to encrypt and decrypt
messages.
If you try to run makeRsaKeys.py again with the same string being passed to

When makeRsaKeys.py is run, the main() function is called, which will create the key files.
Since the keys might take a while for the computer to generate, we print a message on line 9
before the makeKeyFiles() call so the user knows what the program is doing.
The makeKeyFiles() call on line 10 passes the string 'al_sweigart' and the integer
1024. This will generate keys with a size of 1024 bits and store them in files named
al_sweigart_pubkey.txt and al_sweigart_privkey.txt.

The Program’s generateKey() Function
makeRsaKeys.py

13. def generateKey(keySize):
14.
# Creates a public/private key pair with keys that are keySize bits in
15.
# size. This function may take a while to run.
16.
17.
# Step 1: Create two prime numbers, p and q. Calculate n = p * q.
18.
print('Generating p prime...')
19.
p = rabinMiller.generateLargePrime(keySize)
20.
print('Generating q prime...')
21.
q = rabinMiller.generateLargePrime(keySize)
22.
n = p * q

The first step of creating keys is coming up with two random prime numbers which are called p
and q. The generateLargePrime() function we wrote in the last chapter’s rabinMiller.py
program will return a prime number (as an integer value) of the size determined by the value in
keySize on line 19 and line 21. These integer values are stored in variables named p and q.
On line 22, the number n is calculated by multiplying p and q, and stored in n.

# Step 2: Create a number e that is relatively prime to (p-1)*(q-1).
print('Generating e that is relatively prime to (p-1)*(q-1)...')
while True:
# Keep trying random numbers for e until one is valid.
e = random.randrange(2 ** (keySize - 1), 2 ** (keySize))
if cryptomath.gcd(e, (p - 1) * (q - 1)) == 1:

break

The second step is calculating a number e which is relatively prime to the product of p – 1 and
q – 1. The while loop on line 26 is an infinite loop. The random.randrange() call on
line 28 returns a random integer (stored in the e variable) and line 29 tests if this random number
is relatively prime to (p - 1) * (q - 1). If it is, the break statement on line 30 breaks
out of the infinite loop. Otherwise, the program execution jumps back to line 26 and will keep
trying different random numbers until it finds one that is relatively prime with (p - 1) * (q 1).
This way we can guarantee that when the program execution gets past this while loop, the
variable e will contain a number that is relatively prime to (p - 1) * (q - 1).
makeRsaKeys.py

32.
33.
34.

# Step 3: Calculate d, the mod inverse of e.
print('Calculating d that is mod inverse of e...')
d = cryptomath.findModInverse(e, (p - 1) * (q - 1))

The third step is to find the mod inverse of e. The findModInverse() function that we wrote
for our cryptomath module in Chapter 14 will do this calculation for us. The mod inverse of e
is stored in a variable named d.
makeRsaKeys.py

36.
37.

publicKey = (n, e)
privateKey = (n, d)

In the RSA cipher, each key is made up of two numbers. The public key will be the integers
stored in n and e, and the private key will be the integers stored in n and d. Lines 36 and 37 store
these integers as tuples in the variables publicKey and privateKey.
There’s no reason e has to be in the public key and d in the private key, and you could swap
them. However, once you make the public key public, you must keep the private key a secret.

The remaining lines in the generateKey() function print the keys on the screen with
print() calls on lines 39 and 40. Then line 42’s generateKey() call returns a tuple with
publicKey and privateKey.

makeRsaKeys.py

45. def makeKeyFiles(name, keySize):
46.
# Creates two files 'x_pubkey.txt' and 'x_privkey.txt' (where x is the
47.
# value in name) with the the n,e and d,e integers written in them,
48.
# delimited by a comma.

While the generateKey() function will generate the actual integers for the public and private
keys, we need to store these numbers in a file so that our RSA cipher program can use them later
to encrypt and decrypt. Each of the keys are made of two integers that are hundreds of digits long;
that’s too many to memorize or conveniently write down. The easiest way to store them is as text
files on your computer.
This means that you have to be sure that nobody hacks your computer and copies these key files.
It might be a good idea to store these files on a USB thumb drive instead of on your computer.
However, this is also risky. If someone borrows the thumb drive then they could copy the key
files, or if you accidentally break or lose the thumb drive then you will lose your own private key!
makeRsaKeys.py

50.
# Our safety check will prevent us from overwriting our old key files:
51.
if os.path.exists('%s_pubkey.txt' % (name)) or
os.path.exists('%s_privkey.txt' % (name)):
52.
sys.exit('WARNING: The file %s_pubkey.txt or %s_privkey.txt already
exists! Use a different name or delete these files and re-run this program.' %
(name, name))

To prevent us from accidentally deleting our key files by running the program again, line 51
checks to see if the public or private key files with the given name already exist. If they do, the
program will exit with a warning message.
makeRsaKeys.py

54.

publicKey, privateKey = generateKey(keySize)

After the check, line 54 has a call to generateKey() to get the public and private keys using
the multiple assignment trick. The generateKey() function returns a tuple of two tuples. The
first tuple has two integers for the public key and the second tuple has two integers for the private
key. These are stored in the variables publicKey and privateKey.

61.
fo.close()

Line 57 prints some information about the public key. It can tell how many digits are in the
integer in publicKey[0] and publicKey[1] by converting those values to strings with the
str() function, and then finding the length of the string with the len() function.
The key file’s contents will be the key size, a comma, the n integer, another comma, and the e (or
d) integer. The file’s contents will look like: <key size integer>,<n integer>,<e or d integer>
Lines 59 to 61 open a file in write mode, as you can tell from the 'w' string passed to open().

Hybrid Cryptosystems
In real life, the complicated mathematics make RSA and public-key encryption slow to compute.
This is especially true for servers that need to make hundreds or thousands of encrypted
connections a second. Instead, the RSA cipher is often used to encrypt the key for a symmetric
key cipher. The encrypted key is then sent to the other person, and that key is used to pass
messages that are encrypted using the (faster) symmetric cipher. Using a symmetric key cipher
and an asymmetric key cipher to securely communicate like this is called a hybrid

cryptosystem. More information about hybrid cryptosystems can be found at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem.
It’s not recommended to use the rsaCipher.py program to encrypt the keys for, say, the
vigenereCipher.py program. We’ve already proven that the Vigenère cipher is hackable. A strong
symmetric key cipher isn’t covered in this book, but you can still use rsaCipher.py to encrypt
your files anyway.

Source Code for the RSA Cipher Program
Now that you can create key files, let’s write the program that does encryption and decryption
with the RSA cipher. Open a new file editor window by clicking on File ► New Window. Type
in the following code into the file editor, and then save it as rsaCipher.py.

Sample Run of the RSA Cipher Program
Once you have a public and private key file, you can send anyone your public file (or post it
somewhere online) so others can send you messages. If you want to send a secret message to
someone, first get their public key file and place it in the same directory as the rsaCipher.py
program. Set the message variable on line 19 to the string of the message to encrypt.
Make sure the mode variable is set to the string 'encrypt' on line 16, and set the
pubKeyFilename variable to the public key file’s filename on line 20. The filename
variable holds a string of the file that the ciphertext will be written to.
When you run the program, the output will look like this:
Encrypting and writing to encrypted_file.txt...

At the start of the text is 262 (which is the original message length), followed by an underscore
and then 128 (which is the “block size”; block sizes are explained later). If you look carefully at
the long string of digits after that, you will find two commas. The message is encrypted into three
very large integers, separated by commas. These integers are the encrypted form of the string in
the message variable on line 19.
To decrypt, change the mode variable to 'decrypt' and run the program again. Make sure
privKeyFilename on line 28 is set to the filename of the private key file and that this file is
in the same folder as rsaCipher.py. When you run the program, the output on the screen will look
like this:

Note that the way the RSA cipher program is implemented, it can only encrypt and decrypt
plaintext files. A plaintext file (not to be confused with “plaintext” in the cryptography sense) is
a file that only contains text characters (like the kind that you can type on your keyboard). For
example, the .py files that you type for your Python programs are plaintext files. Plaintext files
are the type created with text editor software such as Notepad (on Windows), TextMate (on OS
X), or Gedit (on Ubuntu). Specifically, plaintext files are files that only contain ASCII values
(which are described later in this chapter).
Files such as images, videos, executable programs, or word processor files are called binary

files.(Word processor files are binary files because their text has font, color, and size information

Digital Signatures
Digital signatures is a very large topic of its own, but we can cover a little of it here. Let’s say
Alice sent this email to Bob:
From: alice@inventwithpython.com
To: bob@coffeeghost.net
Subject: Our agreement.
Dear Bob,
I promise to buy your old broken laptop for one
million dollars.
Sincerely,
Alice

This is great news to Bob, who wants to get rid of his worthless laptop for any price. But what if
Alice later claims that she didn’t make this promise, and that the email Bob has is a forgery that
didn’t really come from her. The email just exists as some file on Bob’s computer. Bob could
have easily created this file himself.
If they had met in person, Alice and Bob could have signed a contract. The handwritten signature
is not easy to forge and provides some proof that Alice really did make this promise. But even if
Alice signed such a paper, took a photo of it with her digital camera, and sent Bob the image file,
it is still believable for Alice to say that the image was photoshopped.
The RSA cipher (and any public key cipher) not only provides encryption, but it can also provide
a way to digitally sign a file or string. Remember that RSA has a public key and a private key,
and that any string that is encrypted with one key produces ciphertext that can only be decrypted
with the other key. Normally we encrypt with the public key, so that only the owner of the private
key can decrypt this ciphertext.
But we can also do the reverse. If Alice writes this message, and then “encrypts” it with her
private key, this will produce “ciphertext” that only Alice’s public key can decrypt. This
“ciphertext” isn’t really so secret since everyone in the world has access to Alice’s public key to

398

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

decrypt it. But by encrypting a message with her own private key, Alice has digitally signed
the message in a way that cannot be forged. Everyone can decrypt this signed message with her
public key, and since only Alice has access to her private key, only Alice could have produced
this ciphertext. Alice has to stick to her digital signature; she can’t say that Bob forged or
photoshopped it!
This feature is called nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation is where someone who has made a
statement or claim cannot later refute that they made that statement or claim. Alice could always
claim that her computer was hacked and somebody else had access to her private key, but this
would mean that any other documents she signed could be called into question. (And it would be
very suspicious if Alice’s computer kept “getting hacked” each time she wanted to back out of a
promise.)
Digital signatures can also provide authentication, which allows someone to prove they are who
they say they are. If Alice gets an email claiming to be from the President but wants to be sure it
really is the President, she could always respond with, “Prove you’re the President! Encrypt the
string 'SIMTAVOKXVAHXXSLBGZXVPKNMQMHOYGWFQMXEBCC' with the President’s
private key.” and Alice would be able to decrypt the reply with the President’s public key to see if
it decrypted to her random string. This is called a challenge-response authentication system.
Digital signatures can be used to do many important things, including digital cash, authentication
of public keys, or anonymous web surfing. If you’d like to find out more, go to

A single “byte” can hold a number between 0 and 255, that is, 256 different numbers. We will use
this fact in some of the block-related math explained later. This is why the BYTE_SIZE constant
is set to 256. The DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE constant is set to 128 because we will be using
block sizes of 128 bytes by default in our program. (Block sizes are explained later.)

If mode is set to 'encrypt' the program encrypts a message (and writes it to the file that is
named in filename). If mode is set to 'decrypt' the program reads the contents of an
encrypted file (specified by the string in filename) to decrypt it.
rsaCipher.py

The message variable contains the text to be encrypted, and pubKeyFilename contains the

which will encrypt message using the key, and write the encrypted message to the file named in
filename.

print(decryptedText)

The code that handles calling the decryption function is similar to the code on lines 18 to 33. The
filename of the private key file is set in privKeyFilename. The encrypted file’s filename is
stored in the filename variable. These two variables are passed to a call to

ASCII: Using Numbers to Represent Characters
All data is stored on your computer as numbers. A code called the American Standard Code for
Information Interchange, or ASCII (pronounced “ask-ee”) maps numbers to characters. Table 241 shows how ASCII maps numbers and characters (only numbers 32 to 126 are used):

A single ASCII character uses one byte of memory to store. A byte is enough memory to store a
number from 0 to 255 (for a total of 256 different values.) So the string 'Hello' is actually
stored on your computer as the numbers 72, 101, 108, 108, and 111. These numbers take up 5
bytes. ASCII provides a standard way to convert string characters to numbers and back.
ASCII works fine for English messages, but not so much for other European languages that have
special characters such as the è in “Vigenère”, or languages such as Chinese and Arabic. ASCII
doesn’t even work well outside of America, since ASCII includes the $ dollar sign but not the €
euro or £ pound signs. If you want to learn about Unicode, the international system of character
encoding, go to http://invpy.com/unicode. But this book will use ASCII for simplicity.

The chr() and ord() Functions

information from one format to another format? For example, Morse code was a way of

translating English letters into electric pulses of dots and dashes. ASCII is just a code. We can
encode characters into ASCII numbers and decode ASCII numbers back to characters.
The chr() function (pronounced “char”, short for “character”) takes an integer ASCII number
as the argument and returns a single-character string. The ord() function (short for “ordinal”)
takes a single-character string as the argument, and returns the integer ASCII value for that
character. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>>
'A'
>>>
65
>>>
'I'
>>>
'I'
>>>
'4'
>>>
'F'
>>>
68
>>>

chr(65)
ord('A')
chr(73)
chr(65+8)
chr(52)
chr(ord('F'))
ord(chr(68))

But if you have a string with many letters, it may be easier to use the encode() and
decode() string methods explained later in this chapter.

Blocks
In cryptography, a “block” is a fixed length of bits. In our RSA cipher program, a block is
represented by an integer. We’ve set the block size to 128 bytes, or 1024 bits (since there are 8
bits in 1 byte). Our message string value will be converted into several integer values (i.e. several
blocks).


It is important to note that the RSA encryption algorithm requires that the block size be
equal or less than the key size. Otherwise, the math doesn’t work and you won’t be able
to decrypt the ciphertext the program produced.

402

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

So a cryptographic block is really just a very large integer. Since our block size is 128 bytes, it
can represent any integer between 0 and up to (but not including) 256 ^ 128, which is
179,769,313,486,231,590,772,930,519,078,902,473,361,797,697,894,230,657,273,430,081,157,7
32,675,805,500,963,132,708,477,322,407,536,021,120,113,879,871,393,357,658,789,768,814,41
6,622,492,847,430,639,474,124,377,767,893,424,865,485,276,302,219,601,246,094,119,453,082,
952,085,005,768,838,150,682,342,462,881,473,913,110,540,827,237,163,350,510,684,586,298,2
39,947,245,938,479,716,304,835,356,329,624,224,137,216.
(You might have noticed that the RSA cipher uses a lot of big numbers.)

The reason RSA needs to work on a block (which represents multiple characters) is because if we
used the RSA encryption algorithm on a single character, the same plaintext characters would
always encrypt to the same ciphertext characters. In that case, the RSA cipher just becomes a
simple substitution cipher with fancy mathematics, kind of like the affine and Caesar ciphers.
The RSA cipher works by encrypting an integer that is hundreds of digits long (that is, a block)
into a new integer that is hundreds of digits long (that is, a new block). The mathematics of
encrypting a large plaintext integer to a large ciphertext integer are simple enough. But first we
will need a way to convert between a string and a large integer (that is, a block).
We can use ASCII as a system to convert between a single character and a small integer (between
0 and 255). But we will also need a way to combine several small integers into a large integer that
we perform RSA encryption on.
Remember how the affine cipher in Chapter 15 had two keys, Key A and Key B, but they were
combined by multiplying Key A by the symbol set size (which was 95) and then adding Key B?
This was how we combined two small key integers into one larger key integer.
This worked because the ranges of both Key A and Key B were from 0 to 94. In the RSA
program, each character’s ASCII integer ranges from 0 to 255. To combine ASCII integers
together into one large number we use the following formula:
Take the ASCII integer of the character at index 0 of the string and multiply it by 256 ^ 0 (but
since 256 ^ 0 is 1, and multiplying by 1 leaves you with just the original number, this one is
easy). Take the ASCII integer of the character at index 1 and multiply it by 256 ^ 1. Take the
ASCII integer of the character at index 2 and multiply it by 256 ^ 2, and so on and so on. To get
the final large integer, add all of these products together. This integer is the ciphertext’s block.
Table 24-2 has an example using the string, 'Hello world!':

(You might have noticed that the RSA cipher does a lot of math with big numbers.)

So the string 'Hello world!' when put into a single large integer “block” becomes the
integer 10,334,410,032,606,748,633,331,426,632. This integer uniquely refers to the string
'Hello world!'. By continuing to use larger and larger powers of 256, any string possible
has exactly one large integer. For example, 2,175,540 is the integer for '42!' and
17,802,628,493,700,941 is the integer for 'Moose??' and
23,071,981,395,336,227,453,293,155,570,939,985,398,502,658,016,284,755,880,397,214,576,11
0,064,091,578,359,739,349,325 is the integer for 'My cat's breath smells like cat
food.'.
Because our block size is 128 bytes, we can only encrypt up to 128 characters in a single block.
But we can just use more blocks if the message is longer than 128 characters. The RSA cipher
program will separate the blocks it outputs with commas so we can tell when one block ends and
the next one begins.
As an example, here’s a message that is split into blocks, and the integer that represents each
block (calculated using the same method in Table 24-2.). Each block has at most 128 characters
of the message.

strings to blocks and blocks to strings, so this step isn’t encrypting anything. The encryption will
be done later in the encryptMessage() function.

The encode() String Method and the Bytes Data Type
rsaCipher.py

40.

messageBytes = message.encode('ascii') # convert the string to bytes

First, we need to convert the characters in the message string into ASCII integers. The
encode() string method will return a “bytes” object. Because a byte is represented as a number
from 0 to 255, a bytes value is like a list of integers (although these integers have a very limited
range of 0 to 255). The len() function and indexing work with a bytes object in the same way a
list of integers would. A bytes value can be turned into a list value of integer values by passing it
to the list() function. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = 'hello'.encode('ascii')
>>> spam
b'hello'
>>> list(spam)
[104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
>>> len(spam)
5
>>> spam[2]
108
>>>

Note that a single bytes value is a collection of values, just like a single list value can contain
multiple values. If you try to get a single “byte” from a bytes object (like spam[2] does above),
this just evaluates to an integer value.
Line 140 places the bytes form of the message string in a variable named messageBytes.

The bytes() Function and decode() Bytes Method
Just like you can create a list by calling the list() function, you can also create a bytes object
by calling the bytes() function. The bytes() function is passed a list of integers for the byte
values. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = bytes([104, 101, 108, 108, 111])
>>> spam
b'hello'
>>> list(spam)
[104, 101, 108, 108, 111]

You can also directly type a bytes object into your source code just like you type a string or list.
A bytes object has the letter b right before what looks like an ordinary string value. But
remember, the letter b right before the quotes means that this is a bytes value, not a string value.
Try typing the following into the interactive shell, making sure that there is no space between the
b and the quote characters:
>>> spam = b'hello'
>>> list(spam)
[104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
>>>

We don’t use the decode() bytes method in this program, but you should know about it. It does
the opposite of the encode() string method. When called on a bytes object, the decode()
method returns a string made from the values stored in the bytes object. Try typing the following
into the interactive shell:
>>> spam = bytes([104, 101, 108, 108, 111])
>>> spam.decode('ascii')
'hello'

blockInts = []
for blockStart in range(0, len(messageBytes), blockSize):

The blockInts list will contain the large integer “blocks” form of the characters in message.
The blockSize parameter is set to DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE by default, and the
DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE constant was set to 128 (meaning, 128 bytes) on line 9. This means
that each large integer block can only store 128 string characters at most (since 1 ASCII character
takes up 1 byte). See Table 24-3 for an example of a message split into 128-character blocks.
Line 43’s for loop will set the value in blockStart so that on each iteration it will be set to
the index of the block being created. For example, if blockSize is set to 128, then the index of

the start of the first block will be 0, the index of the start of the second block will be 128, the
index of the start of the third block will be 256, and so on as long as the index is less than
len(messageBytes).

The min() and max() Functions
The min() function returns the smallest (that is, the minimum) value of its arguments. Try
typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> min(13, 32, 13, 15, 17, 39)
13
>>> min(21, 45, 18, 10)
10

You can also pass min() a single argument if the argument is a list or tuple value. In this case,
min() returns the smallest value in that list or tuple. Try typing the following into the interactive
shell:
>>> min([31, 26, 20, 13, 12, 36])
12
>>> spam = (10, 37, 37, 43, 3)
>>> min(spam)
3

The max() function will return the largest (that is, the maximum) value of its arguments:
>>> max(18, 15, 22, 30, 31, 34)

# Calculate the block integer for this block of text
45.
blockInt = 0
46.
for i in range(blockStart, min(blockStart + blockSize,
len(messageBytes))):

The code inside line 43’s for loop will create the very large integer for a single block. Recall
from earlier in this chapter that this is done by multiplying the ASCII value of the character by
(256 ^ index-of-character).

408

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

The very large integer will eventually be stored in blockInt, which starts at 0 on line 45. (This
is much like how our previous cipher programs had a translated variable that started as a
blank string but eventually held the encrypted or decrypted message by the end of the program.)
Line 46’s for loop sets i to be the index of all the characters in message for this block. This
index should start at blockStart and go up to blockStart + blockSize (that is,
blockSize characters after blockStart) or len(messageBytes), whichever is smaller.
The min() call on line 46 will return the smaller of these two expressions.
The second argument to range() on line 46 should be the smaller of these values because each
block will always be made up of 128 (or whatever value is in blockSize) characters, except for
the last block. The last block might be exactly 128 characters, but more likely it is less than the
full 128 characters. In that case we want i to stop at len(messageBytes) because that will
be the last index in messageBytes.
rsaCipher.py

47.

blockInt += messageBytes[i] * (BYTE_SIZE ** (i % blockSize))

The value that is added to the block integer in blockInt is the ASCII value of the character
(which is what messageBytes[i] evaluates to) multiplied by (256 ^ index-of-character).
The variable i cannot directly be used for the index-of-character part of the equation, because it
is the index in the entire messageBytes object which has indexes from 0 up to
len(messageBytes). We only want the index relative to the current iteration’s block, which
will always be from 0 to blockSize. This table shows the difference between these indexes:
Table 24-4. The indexes of the full message on top, and indexes relative to the block on bottom.

By modding i by blockSize, we can get the position relative to the block. This is why line 47
is BYTE_SIZE ** (i % blockSize) instead of BYTE_SIZE ** i.

blockInts.append(blockInt)
return blockInts

After line 46’s for loop completes, the very large integer for the block has been calculated. We
want to append this block integer to the blockInts list. The next iteration of line 43’s for
loop will calculate the block integer for the next block of the message.

After line 43’s for loop has finished, all of the block integers have been calculated and are
stored in the blockInts list. Line 49 returns blockInts from getBlocksFromText().
rsaCipher.py

52. def getTextFromBlocks(blockInts, messageLength,

53.
# Converts a list of block integers to the original message string.
54.
# The original message length is needed to properly convert the last

# block integer.
56.
message = []
57.
for blockInt in blockInts:

The getTextFromBlocks() function does the opposite of getBlocksFromText(). This
function is passed a list of block integers (as the blockInts parameter) and returns the string
value that these blocks represent. The function needs the length of the message encoded in
messageLength, since this information is needed to get the string from the last block integer if
it is not a full 128 characters in size.
Just as before, blockSize will default to DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE if no third argument is
passed to getTextFromBlocks(), and DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE was set to 128 on line 9.
The message list (which starts as blank on line 56) will contain a string value for each character
that was computed from each block integer in blockInts. (This list of strings will be joined
together to form the complete string at the end of getTextFromBlocks().) The message
list starts off empty on line 56. The for loop on line 57 iterates over each block integer in the
blockInts list.
rsaCipher.py

58.
59.

blockMessage = []
for i in range(blockSize - 1, -1, -1):

Inside the for loop, the code from lines 58 to 65 calculates the letters that are in the current
iteration’s block. Recall from Chapter 15’s affine cipher program how one integer key was split
into two integer keys:
24. def getKeyParts(key):
25.
keyA = key // len(SYMBOLS)
26.
keyB = key % len(SYMBOLS)
27.
return (keyA, keyB)

The code in getTextFromBlocks() works in a similar way, except the single integer (i.e. the
block integer) is split into 128 integers (and each is the ASCII value for a single character). The

410

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

way the ASCII numbers are extracted from blockInt has to work backwards, which is why the
for loop on line 59 starts at blockSize - 1, and then subtracts 1 on each iteration down to
(but not including) -1. This means the value of i on the last iteration will be 0.
rsaCipher.py

60.

if len(message) + i < messageLength:
# Decode the message string for the 128 (or whatever
# blockSize is set to) characters from this block integer.
asciiNumber = blockInt // (BYTE_SIZE ** i)
blockInt = blockInt % (BYTE_SIZE ** i)

The length of the message list will be how many characters have been translated from blocks so
far. The if statement on line 60 makes sure the code does not keep computing text from the
block after i has reached the end of the message.
The ASCII number of the next character from the block is calculated by integer dividing
blockInt by (BYTE_SIZE ** i). Now that we have calculated this character, we can
“remove” it from the block by setting blockInt to the remainder of blockInt divided by
(BYTE_SIZE ** i). The % mod operator is used to calculate the remainder.

The insert() List Method
While the append() list method only adds values to the end of a list, the insert() list
method can add a value anywhere in the list. The arguments to insert() are an integer index
of where in the list to insert the value, and the value to be inserted. Try typing the following into
the interactive shell:
>>> spam = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> spam.insert(0, 'hello')
>>> spam
['hello', 2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> spam.insert(2, 'world')
>>> spam
['hello', 2, 'world', 4, 6, 8]
>>>
rsaCipher.py

65.

blockMessage.insert(0, chr(asciiNumber))

Using the chr() function, the character that asciiNumber is the ASCII number of is inserted
to the beginning of the list at index 0.

message.extend(blockMessage)

After the for loop on line 59 completes, blockMessage will be a list of single-character
strings that were computed from the current block integer. The strings in this list are appended to
the end of the message list with the extend() method.
rsaCipher.py

return ''.join(message)

After the for loop on line 57 completes, the single-character strings in message are joined
together into a single string which is the complete message. This string is then returned from the
getTextFromBlocks() function.

The Mathematics of RSA Encrypting and Decrypting
With the numbers for e, d, and n from the public and private keys, the mathematics done on the
block integers to encrypt and decrypt them can be summarized as follows:



Encrypted Block = Plaintext Block ^ e mod n
Decrypted Block = Ciphertext Block ^ d mod n
rsaCipher.py

70. def encryptMessage(message, key, blockSize=DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE):
71.
# Converts the message string into a list of block integers, and then
72.
# encrypts each block integer. Pass the PUBLIC key to encrypt.
73.
encryptedBlocks = []
74.
n, e = key

The encryptMessage() function is passed the plaintext string along with the two-integer
tuple of the private key. The function returns a list of integer blocks of the encrypted ciphertext.
First, the encryptedBlocks variable starts as an empty list that holds the integer blocks and
the two integers in key are assigned to variables n and e.

The pow() Function
While the ** operator does exponents, the pow() function handles exponents and mod. The
expression pow(a, b, c) is equivalent to (a ** b) % c. However, the code inside the
pow() function knows how to intelligently handle very large integers and is much faster than
typing the expression (a ** b) % c. Try typing the following into the interactive shell:
>>> pow(2, 8)

412

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

256
>>> (2 ** 8)
256
>>> pow(2, 8, 10)

77.

79.

for block in getBlocksFromText(message, blockSize):
# ciphertext = plaintext ^ e mod n
encryptedBlocks.append(pow(block, e, n))
return encryptedBlocks

While creating the public and private keys involved a lot of math, the actual math of the
encryption is simple. The very large integer of the block created from the string in message is
raised to e and then modded by n. This expression evaluates to the encrypted block integer, and
is then appended to encryptedBlocks on line 78.
After all the blocks have been encrypted, the function returns encryptedBlocks on line 79.
rsaCipher.py

82. def decryptMessage(encryptedBlocks, messageLength, key,
blockSize=DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE):
83.
# Decrypts a list of encrypted block ints into the original message

# string. The original message length is required to properly decrypt
85.
# the last block. Be sure to pass the PRIVATE key to decrypt.
86.
decryptedBlocks = []
87.
n, d = key

The math used in the decryptMessage() function is also simple. The decryptedBlocks
variable will store a list of the decrypted integer blocks, and the two integers of the key tuple are
placed in n and d respectively using the multiple assignment trick.
rsaCipher.py

88.
89.
90.

for block in encryptedBlocks:
# plaintext = ciphertext ^ d mod n
decryptedBlocks.append(pow(block, d, n))

The math of the decryption on line 90 is the same as the encryption’s math, except the integer
block is being raised to d instead of e.

return getTextFromBlocks(decryptedBlocks, messageLength, blockSize)

The decrypted blocks along with the messageLength and blockSize parameters are passed
getTextFromBlocks() so that the decrypted plaintext as a string is returned from
decryptMessage().

Reading in the Public & Private Keys from their Key Files
rsaCipher.py

94. def readKeyFile(keyFilename):
95.
# Given the filename of a file that contains a public or private key,
96.
# return the key as a (n,e) or (n,d) tuple value.
97.
fo = open(keyFilename)
98.
content = fo.read()
99.
fo.close()

The key files that makeRsakeys.py creates look like this:
<key size as an integer>,<big integer for N>,<big integer for E or D>
The readKeyFile() function is called to read the key size, n, and e (for the public key) or d
(for the private key) values from the key file. Lines 97 to 99 open this file and read in the contents
as a string into the content variable.
rsaCipher.py

100.
101.

keySize, n, EorD = content.split(',')
return (int(keySize), int(n), int(EorD))

The split() string method splits up the string in content along the commas. The list that
split() returns will have three items in it, and the multiple assignment trick will place each of
these items into the keySize, n, and EorD variables respectively on line 100.
Remember that content was a string when it was read from the file, and the items in the list
that split() returns will also be string values. So before returning the keySize, n, and EorD
values, they are each passed to int() to return an integer form of the value. This is how
readKeyFile() returns three integers that were read from the key file.

The Full RSA Encryption Process
rsaCipher.py

104. def encryptAndWriteToFile(messageFilename, keyFilename, message,
blockSize=DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE):

414

105.
106.
107.

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

# Using a key from a key file, encrypt the message and save it to a
# file. Returns the encrypted message string.
keySize, n, e = readKeyFile(keyFilename)

The encryptAndWriteToFile() function is passed three string arguments: a filename to
write the encrypted message in, a filename of the public key to use, and a message to be
encrypted. This function handles not just encrypting the string with the key, but also creating the
file that contains the encrypted contents. (The blockSize parameter can also be specified, but
it will be set to DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE by default, which is 128.)
The first step is to read in the values for keySize, n, and e from the key file by calling
readKeyFile() on line 107.
rsaCipher.py

109.
# Check that key size is greater than block size.
110.
if keySize < blockSize * 8: # * 8 to convert bytes to bits
111.
sys.exit('ERROR: Block size is %s bits and key size is %s bits.
The RSA cipher requires the block size to be equal to or less than the key
size. Either increase the block size or use different keys.' % (blockSize * 8,
keySize))

In order for the mathematics of the RSA cipher to work, the key size must be equal to or greater
than the block size. The blockSize value is in bytes, while the key size that was stored in the
key file was in bits, so we multiply the integer in blockSize by 8 on line 110 so that both of
these values represent number of bits.
If keySize is less than blockSize * 8, the program exits with an error message. The user
will either have to decrease the value passed for blockSize or use a larger key.
rsaCipher.py

114.
115.

# Encrypt the message
encryptedBlocks = encryptMessage(message, (n, e), blockSize)

Now that we have the n and e values for the key, we call the encryptMessage() function
which returns a list of integer blocks on line 115. The encryptMessage() is expecting a twointeger tuple for the key, which is why the n and e variables are placed inside a tuple that is then
passed as the second argument for encryptMessage().

encryptedBlocks[i] = str(encryptedBlocks[i])
encryptedContent = ','.join(encryptedBlocks)

The join() method will return a string of the blocks separated by commas, but join() only
works on lists with string values, and encryptedBlocks is a list of integers. These integers
will have to first be converted into strings.
The for loop on line 118 iterates through each index in encryptedBlocks, replacing the
integer at encryptedBlocks[i] with a string form of the integer. When the loop completes,
encryptedBlocks now contains a list of string values instead of a list of integer values.
The list of string values is passed to the join() method, which returns a single string of the
list’s strings joined together with commas. Line 120 stores this string in a variable named
encryptedContent.
rsaCipher.py

122.
# Write out the encrypted string to the output file.
123.
encryptedContent = '%s_%s_%s' % (len(message), blockSize,
encryptedContent)

We want to write out more than just the encrypted integer blocks to the file though, so line 123
changes the encryptedContent variable to include the size of the message (as an integer),
followed by an underscore, followed by the blockSize (which is also an integer), followed by
another underscore, and then followed by the encrypted integer blocks.
rsaCipher.py

124.
125.
126.

fo = open(messageFilename, 'w')
fo.write(encryptedContent)
fo.close()

The last step is to write out the contents of the encrypted file. The filename provided by the
messageFilename parameter is created with the call to open() on line 124. (The 'w'
argument tells open() to open the file in “write mode”.) Note that if a file with this name
already exists, then it will be overwritten by the new file.
The string in encryptedContent is written to the file by calling the write() method on
line 125. Now that we are done writing the file’s contents, line 126 closes the file object in fo.
rsaCipher.py

127.
128.

# Also return the encrypted string.
return encryptedContent

416

http://inventwithpython.com/hacking

Finally, the string in encryptedContent is returned from the
encryptAndWriteToFile() function on line 128. (This is so that the code that calls the
function can use this string to, for example, print it on the screen.)

rsaCipher.py

131. def readFromFileAndDecrypt(messageFilename, keyFilename):
132.
# Using a key from a key file, read an encrypted message from a file
133.
# and then decrypt it. Returns the decrypted message string.
134.
keySize, n, d = readKeyFile(keyFilename)

The readFromFileAndDecrypt() function, like encryptAndWriteToFile(), has
parameters for the encrypted message file’s filename and the key file’s filename. (Be sure to pass
the filename of the private key for keyFilename, not the public key.)
The first step is the same as encryptAndWriteToFile(): the readKeyFile() function
is called to get the values for the keySize, n, and d variables.
rsaCipher.py

# Read in the message length and the encrypted message from the file.
fo = open(messageFilename)
content = fo.read()
messageLength, blockSize, encryptedMessage = content.split('_')
messageLength = int(messageLength)
blockSize = int(blockSize)

The second step is to read in the contents of the file. The messageFilename file is opened for
reading (the lack of a second argument means open() will use “read mode”) on line 138. The
read() method call on line 139 will return a string of the full contents of the file.
Remember that the encrypted file’s format has an integer of the message length, an integer for the
block size used, and then the encrypted integer blocks (all separated by underscore characters).
Line 140 calls the split() method to return a list of these three values, and the multiple
assignment trick places the three values into the messageLength, blockSize, and
message variables respectively.
Because the values returned by split() will be strings, lines 141 and 142 will set
messageLength and blockSize to their integer form, respectively.

The readFromFileAndDecrypt() function also has a check that the block size is equal to
or less than the key size. This should always pass, because if the block size was too small, then it
would have been impossible to create this encrypted file. Most likely the wrong private key file
was specified for the keyFilename parameter, which means the key would not have decrypted

Why Can’t We Hack the RSA Cipher
All the different types of cryptographic attacks we’ve used in this book can’t be used against the
RSA cipher:
1. The brute-force attack won’t work. There are too many possible keys to go through.
2. A dictionary attack won’t work because the keys are based on numbers, not words.
3. A word pattern attack can’t be used because the same plaintext word can be encrypted
differently depending on where in the block it appears.
4. Frequency analysis can’t be used. Since a single encrypted block represents several
characters, we can’t get a frequency count of the individual characters.
There are no mathematical tricks that work, either. Remember, the RSA decryption equation is:
M = C^d mod n
Where M is the message block integer, C is the ciphertext block integer, and the private key is
made up of the two numbers (d, n). Everyone (including a cryptanalyst) has the public key file,
which provides (e, n), so the n number is known. If the cryptanalyst can intercept the ciphertext
(which we should always assume is possible), then she knows C as well. But without knowing d,
it is impossible to do the decryption and calculate M, the original message.
A cryptanalyst knows that d is the inverse of e mod (p – 1) × (q – 1) and also knows e from the
public key. But there’s no way she knows what (p – 1) × (q – 1) is. There are some hints to figure
it out though.
The key sizes are known (it’s in the public key file), so the cryptanalyst knows that p and q are
less than 2 ^ 1024 and that e is relatively prime with (p – 1) × (q – 1). But e is relatively prime
with a lot of numbers, and with a range of 0 to 2 ^ 1024 possible numbers, it is too large to bruteforce.
The cryptanalyst has another hint from the public key, though. The public key is two numbers (e,
n). And from the RSA algorithm she knows that n = p × q. And since p and q are both prime
numbers, for the given n number there can be only two numbers for p and q.

(Remember, prime numbers have no factors besides 1 and themselves. If you multiply two prime
numbers, that new number will only have the factors of 1 and itself, and also the two prime
numbers.)
So to solve everything and hack the RSA cipher, all we need to do is figure out what the factors
are for n. Since there are two and only two numbers that multiply to n, we won’t have several
different numbers to choose from. Then we can calculate (p – 1) × (q – 1) and then calculate d.
This seems pretty easy. We already have code that finds factors in primeSieve.py’s isPrime()

We can just modify this code to return the first factors it finds (since we know that there can be
only two factors for n besides 1 and n):
def isPrime(num):
# Returns (p,q) where p and q are factors of num
# see if num is divisible by any number up to the square root of num
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
if num % i == 0:
return (i, num / i)
return None # no factors exist for num, num must be prime

We can just call this function, pass it n (which we get from the public key file), and wait for it to
find our factors, p and q. Then we can know what (p – 1) × (q – 1) is, which means we can
calculate the mod inverse of e mod (p – 1) × (q – 1), which is d, the decryption key. Then it
would be easy to calculate M, the plaintext message.

There’s a problem, though. Remember that n is a number that is around 600 digits long. In fact,
Python’s math.sqrt() function can’t even handle a number that big (it will give you an error
message). But even if it could, Python would be executing that for loop for a very, very long
time.
Our Sun doesn’t have enough mass to eventually go supernova, but in 5 billion years it will
expand into a red giant star and utterly destroy the Earth. Even if your computer was still running
then, there’s still no chance that 5 billion years is long enough to find the factors of n. That is how
big the numbers we are dealing with are.
And here’s where the strength of the RSA cipher comes from: Mathematically, there is no
shortcut to finding the factors of a number. It’s easy to look at a small number like 15 and say,
“Oh, 5 and 3 are two numbers that multiply to 15. Those are factors of 15.” But it’s another thing
entirely to take a (relatively small) number like 178,565,887,643,607,245,654,502,737 and try to
figure out the factors for it. The only way we can try is by brute-forcing through numbers, but
there are too many numbers.
It is really easy to come up with two prime numbers p and q and multiply them together to get n.
But it is reasonably impossible to take a number n and figure out what p and q are. These facts
make the RSA cipher usable as a cryptographic cipher.

Summary
That’s it! This is the last chapter of the book! There is no “Hacking the RSA Cipher” chapter
because there’s no straightforward attack on the mathematics behind the RSA cipher. And any
brute-force attack would fail, because there are far too many possible keys to try: the keys are
literally hundreds of digits long. If you had a trillion buildings each with a trillion computers that
each tried a trillion keys every nanosecond, it would still take longer than the universe as been in
existence to go through a fraction of the possible keys. (And the electric bill for all those
computers would bankrupt every industrialized nation on the planet.)
That’s a lot of possible keys.
The RSA algorithm is a real encryption cipher used in professional encryption software. When
you log into a website or buy something off the Internet, the RSA cipher (or one like it) is used to
keep passwords and credit card numbers secret from anyone who may be intercepting your
network traffic.
Actually, while the basic mathematics used for professional encryption software are the same as
described in this chapter, you probably don’t want to use this program for your secret files. The
hacks against an encryption program like rsaCipher.py are pretty sophisticated, but they do exist.
(For example, the “random” numbers returned from random.randint() aren’t truly random

and can be predicted, meaning that a hacker could figure out which “random” numbers were used
for the prime numbers of your private key.)
You’ve seen how all the previous ciphers in this book have each been hacked and rendered
worthless. In general, you don’t want to write your own cryptography code for things you want to
keep secret, because you will probably make subtle mistakes in the implementation of these
programs. And hackers and spy agencies use these mistakes to hack your encrypted messages.
A cipher is only secure if everything but the key can be revealed but still keep the message a
secret. You cannot rely on a cryptanalyst not having access to the same encryption software or
knowing what cipher you used. Remember Shannon’s Maxim: The enemy knows the system!
Professional encryption software is written by cryptographers who have spent years studying the
mathematics and potential weaknesses of various ciphers. Even then, the software they write is
inspected by other cryptographers to check for mistakes or potential weaknesses. You are
perfectly capable of learning about these cipher systems and cryptographic mathematics too. It’s
not about being the smartest hacker, but spending the time to study to become the most
knowledgeable hacker.
I hope you’ve found this book to be a helpful start on becoming an elite hacker and programmer.
There is a lot more to learn about programming and cryptography than what is in this book, but I
encourage you explore and learn more! One great book about the general history of cryptography
that I highly recommend is “The Code Book” by Simon Singh. You can go to

cryptography. Feel free to email me your programming or cryptography questions at

---------------------------------------------FOREWORD
This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great War of the Ring and included
many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that preceded it. It was begun soon after _The
Hobbit_ was written and before its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I
wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder Days, which had
then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this for my own satisfaction, and I had little
hope that other people would be interested in this work, especially since it was primarily linguistic
in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of 'history' for Elvish
tongues.

When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected _little hope_ to _no hope,_ I went
back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits
and their adventures. But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an
account, as it were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told. The
process had begun in the writing of _The Hobbit,_ in which there were already some references to
the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen
unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the
Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to
the ancient histories revealed the Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.
Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to wait
a long time; for the composition of _The Lord of the Rings_ went on at intervals during the years
1936 to 1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests
as a learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, of course, also increased by the
outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of Book
One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that the story could not now be wholly
abandoned, and I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin's tomb in Moria. There I halted
for a long while. It was almost a year later when I went on and so came to Lothlórien and the Great
River late in 1941. In the next year I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book
Three, and the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons flared in
Anórien and Théoden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had failed and there was no time for
thought.
It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to
conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These
chapters, eventually to become Book Four, were written and sent out as a serial to my son,
Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took another five years before the
tale was brought to its present end; in that time I changed my house, my chair, and my college, and
the days though less dark were no less laborious. Then when the 'end' had at last been reached the
whole story had to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards. And it had to be typed, and
re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond my means.
_The Lord of the Rings_ has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print; and I
should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I have
received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the
desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers,
amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them. As a guide I had
only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often
at fault. Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring,
absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their
works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of
many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a
long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find
from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all
by others specially approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor
and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again,
he will pass over these in silence, except one that has been noted by others: the book is too short.
As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither
allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected
branches: but its main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the
link between it and _The Hobbit._ The crucial chapter, "The Shadow of the Past', is one of the
oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat
of inevitable disaster, and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the

same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or in some
cases already written, and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its
sequels.
The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had
inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized
and used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dûr would
not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would m the
confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches
into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to
challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits
in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.
Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory
or topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done
so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned,
with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse
'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the
purposed domination of the author.
An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience, but the ways in which a
story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely complex, and attempts to define the process
are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous. It is also false, though
naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped, to suppose that the
movements of thought or the events of times common to both were necessarily the most powerful
influences. One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression;
but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less
hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of
my close friends were dead. Or to take a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some that
'The Scouring of the Shire' reflects the situation in England at the time when I was finishing my
tale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot, foreseen from the outset, though in the event
modified by the character of Saruman as developed in the story without, need I say, any allegorical
significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some basis in
experience, though slender (for the economic situation was entirely different), and much further
back. The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in
days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still building
suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving
corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important. I never liked the looks of the
Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.
_The Lord of the Rings_ is now issued in a new edition, and the opportunity has been taken of
revising it. A number of errors and inconsistencies that still remained in the text have been
corrected, and an attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive
readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and if some seem to have
been passed over that may be because I have failed to keep my notes in order; but many enquiries
could only be answered by additional appendices, or indeed by the production of an accessory
volume containing much of the material that I did not include in the original edition, in particular
more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime this edition offers this Foreword, an addition
to the Prologue, some notes, and an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in
intention complete in items but not in references, since for the present purpose it has been
necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of the material prepared for me by
Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather to the accessory volume.

PROLOGUE
This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may discover much of
their character and a little of their history. Further information will also be found in the selection
from the Red Book of Westmarch that has already been published, under the title of _The Hobbit_.
That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed by Bilbo himself, the
first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and called by him _There and Back Again,_
since they told of his journey into the East and his return: an adventure which later involved all the
Hobbits in the great events of that Age that are here related.
Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while
some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more important points
are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and the first adventure is briefly recalled.
Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are
today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed
countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not and did not understand or like machines more
complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with
tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as they call us, and now they
avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and
though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and
deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently,
when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by; and this an they have
developed until to Men it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any
kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a
close friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.
For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and stocky, that is, even when they
are not actually much shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our
measure. They seldom now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days
they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son of Isengrim the
Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by
two famous characters of old; but that curious matter is dealt with in this book.
As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, in the days of their peace
and prosperity they were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow
and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a
thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was commonly brown. Thus, the only
craft little practised among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could
make many other useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than
beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking.
And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times,
and of six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties,
and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.
It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us
than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion,
and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can
no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost
and forgotten. Only the Elves still preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions
are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are
not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many

long years before other folk became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of
strange creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little importance. But in the days
of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of their own, both important and
renowned, and troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great.
Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has
been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in
which they still linger: the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the
Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other than genealogical lore)
was far from general among them, but there remained still a few in the older families who studied
their own books, and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and
Men. Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and their most ancient legends
hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends,
and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in
the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the
upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why
they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer
certain. Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow that fell
on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.
Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become divided into three
somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin,
smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and
nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier in build; their
feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer
of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees
and of woodlands.
The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long lived in the foothills of
the mountains. They moved westward early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while
the others were still in the Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of
Hobbit, and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one place, and longest
preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.
The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and were less shy of Men.
They came west after the Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there
many of them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north
again.
The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with
Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and
of old they preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came
down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded
them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as leaders or
chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even in Bilbo's time the strong Fallohidish strain
could still be noted among the greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland.
In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the Mountains of Lune, the
Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Dúnedain, the kings
of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of
their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to spare for
incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered communities. Most of their earlier
settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbo's time; but one of the first to become
important still endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that lay round
about, some forty miles east of the Shire.

It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their letters and began to write
after the manner of the Dúnedain, who had in their turn long before learned the art from the Elves.
And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever after
the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current through all the lands of the
kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they
kept a few words of their own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of
personal names out of the past.
About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of years. For it
was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers,
Marcho and Blanco, set out from Bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at
Fornost, they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of Hobbits. They passed
over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in the days of the power of the North Kingdom,
and they took ail the land beyond to dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was
demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and all other bridges and
roads, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge his lordship.
Thus began the _Shire-reckoning,_ for the year of the crossing of the Brandywine (as the
Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, and all later dates were reckoned from it.
At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon
passed once more out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king they were in
name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with
events in the world outside. To the last battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent
some bowmen to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record it. But in
that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the land for their own, and they
chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone. There for a
thousand years they were little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark
Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that followed it. Many
thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) were at the time of this tale long past
and the Hobbits had again become accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though
it had long been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and there the king had
once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.
Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, and fifty from the
northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits named it the Shire, as the region of the
authority of their Thain, and a district of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of
the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less and less the world
outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in
Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever
known of the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire.
They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember it.
At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never fought among themselves.
In olden days they had, of course, been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard
world; but in Bilbo's time that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and
indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the Shire, was beyond living
memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of
Orcs. Even the weathers had grown milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the
North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there was still some
store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths or on
walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for
anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a
_mathom_. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the
presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son.

Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it,
difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least
because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief,
foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further
than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that
lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow,
for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows. If any Hobbit
stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.
All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they believed, and in such
dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other
forms of abode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo's days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the
poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living in burrows of the most
primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or none; while the well-to-do still
constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large
and ramifying tunnels (or _smials_ as they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and in
the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they multiplied, began to build above ground.
Indeed, even in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the
chief township of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now many houses of
wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights,
and others of that sort; for even when they had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed
to build sheds and workshops.
The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the
Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large
and heavy-legged, and they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be
Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their
chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the Marish, and of
Buckland, east of the River, which they afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the
Shire up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found
elsewhere in the Shire.
It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, was derived from the
Dúnedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in their
youth. For the Elves of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at
that time at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach of the Shire. Three
Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western marches.
They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green
mound. The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop of that tower;
but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon
the Sea, and fewer still had ever returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small
boats with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of the Shire
lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful of those
that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death,
and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west.
The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits used it in their own
fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and comfortable. The
oldest kind were, indeed, no more than built imitations of _smials,_ thatched with dry grass or
straw, or roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged to
the early days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved by devices,
learned from Dwarves, or discovered by themselves. A preference for round windows, and even
round doors, was the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture.

The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and inhabited by large families.
(Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other
ways, such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great
Smials, or the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in (comparative)
peace together in one ancestral and many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, in any case,
clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long and elaborate familytrees with innumerable branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related
to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out a family-tree that
included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these
tales tell of. The genealogical trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in
themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such
things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew, set
out fair and square with no contradictions.

There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be mentioned, an astonishing
habit: they imbibed or inhaled, through pipes of clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of a
herb, which they called _pipe-weed_ or _leaf,_ a variety probably of _Nicotiana._ A great deal of
mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or 'art' as the Hobbits preferred to call it. All
that could be discovered about it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later
Master of Buckland), and since he and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history
that follows, his remarks in the introduction to his _Herblore of the Shire_ may be quoted.
'This,' he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own invention. When Hobbits
first began to smoke is not known, all the legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages
folk in the Shire smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that
Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true pipe-weed in his
gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best
home-grown still comes from that district, especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf,
Old Toby, and Southern Star.
'How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell. He
knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree,
though he certainly never went further from the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he
learned of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south slopes of the hill.
The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of
course, to have done everything before the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as "colonists";
but in this case their claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from Bree that the art of
smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk,
Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting. The
home and centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, _The Prancing Pony,_ that has
been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record.
'All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys south have convinced
me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of the world, but came northward from the lower
Anduin, whither it was, I suspect, originally brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse. It grows
abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the North, where it is never found wild,
and flourishes only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it _sweet
galenas,_ and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been
carried up the Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and our own day.

But even the Dúnedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits first put it into pipes. Not even the
Wizards first thought of that before we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long
ago, and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.'
The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already referred to. North, South, East,
and West; and these again each into a number of folklands, which still bore the names of some of
the old leading families, although by the time of this history these names were no longer found only
in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the Tookland, but that was not true of many
other families, such as the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were the East and West
Marches: the Buckland (see beginning of Chapter V, Book I); and the Westmarch added to the
Shire in S.R. 1462.
The Shire at this time had hardly any 'government'. Families for the most part managed their
own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied most of their time. In other matters they were, as
a rule, generous and not greedy, but contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, and
small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations.
There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high king at Fornost, or Norbury
as they called it, away north of the Shire. But there had been no king for nearly a thousand years,
and even the ruins of Kings' Norbury were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild
folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king. For they attributed to the
king of old all their essential laws; and usually they kept the laws of free will, because they were
The Rules (as they said), both ancient and just.
It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for the office of Thain had passed to
them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries before, and the chief Took had borne that title ever since.
The Thain was the master of the Shire-moot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the Hobbitry-inarms, but as muster and moot were only held in times of emergency, which no longer occurred, the
Thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family was still, indeed,
accorded a special respect, for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable
to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous
temperament. The latter qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally
approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the family as The Took, and
of adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim the Second, for instance.
The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of Michel Delving (or of the Shire),
who was elected every seven years at the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe, that is at
Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was to preside at banquets, given on the Shireholidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of Postmaster and First Shirriff were
attached to the mayoralty, so that he managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These
were the only Shire-services, and the Messengers were the most numerous, and much the busier of
the two. By no means all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were wrote constantly to all their
friends (and a selection of their relations) who lived further off than an afternoon's walk.
The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police, or the nearest equivalent that
they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather
in their caps; and they were in practice rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with the
strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve of them, three in each
Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying at need, was employed to 'beat the bounds',
and to see that Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance.
At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they were called, had been greatly
increased. There were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling
about the borders, or over them: the first sign that all was not quite as it should be, and always had
been except in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even Bilbo yet had any

notion of what it portended. Sixty years had passed since he set out on his memorable journey, and
he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred as often as not; but much evidently still
remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much or how little he revealed
to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite 'nephew'. And he still kept secret the ring that he bad
found.
As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey,
and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings,
and his twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a
morning of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great treasure, the
dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in the East. The
quest was successful, and the Dragon that guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all
was won the Battle of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many deeds of renown
were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned more than a note in
the long annals of the Third Age, but for an 'accident' by the way. The party was assailed by Orcs in
a high pass of the Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo
was lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep under the mountains, and there, as he groped in
vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the floor of a tunnel. He put it in his pocket. It
seemed then like mere luck.
Trying to find his way out. Bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains, until he could go
no further. At the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and on an island of rock in
the water lived Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his large
flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish with his long fingers, and eating
them raw. He ate any living thing, even orc, if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle.
He possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a
ring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one thing he loved, his 'precious', and he
talked to it, even when it was not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except
when he was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines.
Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him when they met; but it
was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So to gain
time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo
could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him, then he would do as
Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.
Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor back. Bilbo accepted the
challenge; and they asked one another many riddles. In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck
(as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand
came upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten: _What haw I got in my pocket?_ This Gollum
failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses.
The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere 'question' and not a
'riddle' according to the strict rules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to
guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; for
the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false, even though such promises were
held sacred, and of old all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But after ages alone in the
dark Gollum's heart was black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to the island,
of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was
hungry now, and angry, and once his 'precious' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all.
But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone. His screech sent a shiver down
Bilbo's back, though he did not yet understand what had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to
a guess, too late. _What has it got in its pocketses?_ he cried. The light in his eyes was like a green
flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his 'precious'. Just in time Bilbo saw his

peril, and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water; and once more he was saved by his
luck. For just as he ran he put his hand in his pocket, and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger.
So it was that Gollum passed him without seeing him, and went to guard the way out, lest the 'thief'
should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about
his 'precious'; from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope came to him in the
darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape from the orcs and from
Gollum.
At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the mines,
on the eastward side of the mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and
Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring, in
which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a
disadvantage. In the end, gathering his courage, he leaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled away
down the passage, pursued by his enemy's cries of hate and despair: _Thief, thief! Baggins! We
hates it for ever!_
Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told it to his companions. To them
his account was that Gollum had promised to give him a _present,_ if he won the game; but when
Gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had
been given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had
found, and as he had won the game, it was already his by right. But being in a tight place, he said
nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the way out, as a reward instead of a present. This
account Bilbo set down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not even
after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in the original Red Book, as it did in several
of the copies and abstracts. But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no
doubt from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they seem to have
been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself.
Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued to be
very curious about the ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning,
which for a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth important.
Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and disturbing, to find that the good
hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a 'present' was
not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum's
talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his 'birthday present', many times. That
also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for many
more years, as will be seen in this book.
Of Bilbo's later adventures little more need be said here. With the help of the ring he escaped
from the orc-guards at the gate and rejoined his companions. He used the ring many times on his
quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After
his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf and Frodo; and no one
else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of
his Journey that he was writing.
His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the
Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in
fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and
the ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket.
He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), and
nothing very notable occurred in the Shire until Mr. Baggins began the preparations for the
celebration of his hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History begins.

At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great events that led to the
inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest
in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected
and Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in the Kingdom at large,
and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends. By the end of the first century
of the Fourth Age there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained many
historical books and records.
The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, and at Brandy
Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch.
That most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long
preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the Westmarch. It was in origin
Bilbo's private diary, which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire,
together with many loose leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his
account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably m a single red case, were the
three large volumes, bound in red leather, that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four
volumes there was added in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various
other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.
The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made, especially of the
first volume, for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The most important
copy, however, has a different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but it was written in Condor,
probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172).
Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King's Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an
exact copy in all details of the Thain's Book m Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the
request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and was brought to him by the Thain
Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64.
The Thain's Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was
later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections, especially
of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated
version of those parts of _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_ which lie outside the account of the
War. The full tale is stated to have been written by Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some
time after the passing of the King. But the chief importance of Findegil's copy is that it alone
contains the whole of Bilbo's 'Translations from the Elvish'. These three volumes were found to be
a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources
available to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo,
being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.
Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time kept
up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough
contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works
dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by
Meriadoc himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his _Herblore of the Shire,_
and for his _Reckoning of Years_ m which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Shire
and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on _Old Words
and Names in the Shire,_ having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the
Rohirrim of such 'shire-words' as _mathom_ and old elements in place names.
At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though more important for larger
history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected many
manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends
relating to Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the
history of Númenor and the arising of Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that _The Tale of
Years_ was put together, with the assistance of material collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates

given are often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that
Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once.
There, though Elrond had departed, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven
folk. It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel; but there is no
record of the day when at last he sought the Grey Havens, and with him went the last living
memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.
---------------------------------------------------------THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING
_being the first part of
The Lord of the Rings_
BOOK I
_Chapter 1_
A Long-expected Party
When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his
eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in
Hobbiton.
Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever
since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his
travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might
say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough
for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have
little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began
to call him _well_-preserved, but _unchanged_ would have been nearer the mark. There were some
that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone
should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and trouble will come of it!'
But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people
were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with
his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers
among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up.
The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninetynine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the
Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday,
September 22nd. 'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said Bilbo one day; 'and then
we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' At that time Frodo was still in his
_tweens,_ as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at
thirty-three.

Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthdayparties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned
for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be _eleventy-one,_ 111, a rather curious number and a very
respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to
be _thirty-three,_ 33) an important number: the date of his 'coming of age'.
Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all
over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic
of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.
No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer.
He held forth at _The Ivy Bush_, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some
authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in
the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was
mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly
terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below
Bag End.
'A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I've always said,' the Gaffer declared.
With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting
him constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of 'roots', especially potatoes, the
Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).
'But what about this Frodo that lives with him?' asked Old Noakes of Bywater. 'Baggins is his
name, but he's more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton
should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.'
'And no wonder they're queer,' put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer's next-door neighbour), 'if they
live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad
place, if half the tales be true.'
'You're right, Dad!' said the Gaffer. 'Not that the Brandybucks of Buck-land live _in_ the Old
Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river – and that
isn't natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice
a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After
all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never
much to tell of him, till he was drownded.'
'Drownded?' said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of
course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again. 'Well, so
they say,' said the Gaffer. 'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She
was our Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of the Old
Took's daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first _and_ second
cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at
Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him
being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out
_boating_on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a
child and all. '
'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said Old Noakes; 'and it was
Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.'
'And _I_ heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,' said Sandyman, the Hobbiton
miller.
'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who did not much like the
miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for
those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr.
Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being
brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never

had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than
when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk.
'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they were going
to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back
and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him!
And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The SackvilleBagginses won't never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.'
'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a stranger, a visitor on
business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. 'All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed
with chests of gold and silver, _and_jools, by what I've heard. '
'Then you've heard more than I can speak to,' answered the Gaffer. I know nothing about
_jools._ Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnelmaking. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I'd not
long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag End
helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on.
And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and
a couple of chests. I don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts,
where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn't enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam
will know more about that. He's in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is,
and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo's tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters – meaning no harm,
mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.
_'Elves and Dragons'_ I says to him. '_Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don't
go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you'll land in trouble too big for you,'_I says
to him. And I might say it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.
But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo's wealth was now too firmly
fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits.
'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,' argued the miller, voicing
common opinion. 'He's often away from home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him:
dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you
like, Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.'
'And you can say _what you_ like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Mr.
Sandyman,' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual. If that's being queer, then
we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There's some not far away that wouldn't offer
a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag
End. Our Sam says that _everyone's_ going to be invited to the party, and there's going to be
presents, mark you, presents for all – this very month as is.'
That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour
(probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be
fireworks – fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century,
not indeed since the Old Took died.
Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking
packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits
peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs:
dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the
second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of the Brandywine
Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a
long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out
beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right
up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man

began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a
large red G and the elf-rune, .
That was Gandalf's mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in
the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more
difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the
'attractions' at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. 'G for Grand!' they shouted,
and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton
occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen
one of his firework displays – they now belonged to the legendary past.
When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading. Bilbo gave a
few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the
onlookers.
'Run away now!' said Gandalf. 'You will get plenty when the time comes.' Then he disappeared
inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while,
and then made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.
Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out
west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and
golden: snap-dragons and sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping
in at the round windows.
'How bright your garden looks!' said Gandalf.
'Yes,' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a
holiday.'
'You mean to go on with your plan then?'
'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.'
'Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan – your whole plan, mind – and I
hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of us.'
'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.'
'Who will laugh, I wonder?' said Gandalf, shaking his head.
'We shall see,' said Bilbo.
The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There might have been some
grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every
kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or
anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on
the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.
Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and
the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There
was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on _Thank
you, I shall certainly come._
A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY
BUSINESS. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside.
Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some
private preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view.
One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo's front door, covered with
ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road,
and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,
adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped
even pretending to work in his garden.

The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in
the field was right inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns
were hung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eatinghouse for miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered
at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.
Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety was
intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds
vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.
Bilbo Baggins called it a _party,_ but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one.
Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they
turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire were also
asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at
the new white gate in person. He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were those who
went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people
on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion;
but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was
somebody's birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at
least once a week. But they never got tired of them.
On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that for
a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen
before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year
before, and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.
When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs, dances,
music, games, and, of course, food and drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and
dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the
guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were merely lots of people eating
and drinking – continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.
The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by
him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was
also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles,
elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved
with age.
There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There were
green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a
moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits,
disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains
of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and
a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a
yell like an embattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot
snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits
exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like
a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet
flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon – not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws,
his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd.
They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a
somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.
'That is the signal for supper!' said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except

those invited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the tree.
The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross,
though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all
the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated
friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission;
for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially when
there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.
There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were
various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins' grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his
Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies,
Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and
some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the Shire.
The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked
Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that
they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food
for many years and his table had a high reputation.
All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded
the after-dinner speech of their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures of his
mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a _very_ pleasant feast, in fact an
engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell
almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo's catering had depleted
the stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.
After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however, now in a
tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called 'filling up the corners'. They were sipping
their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They
were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.
_My dear People,_ began Bilbo, rising in his place. 'Hear! Hear! Hear!' they shouted, and kept
on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and
went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming
face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing,
waving one hand in the air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.
_My dear Bagginses and Boffins,_ he began again; _and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and
Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies,
Brockhouses and Proudfoots._ 'ProudFEET!' shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the
pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally
furry, and both were on the table.
_Proudfoots,_ repeated Bilbo. _Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last
to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today!_ 'Hurray!
Hurray! Many Happy Returns!' they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was
doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.
_I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am._ Deafening cheers. Cries of _Yes_
(and _No)._ Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments. There
were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled.
Most of them bore the mark DALE on them; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits, but
they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect
make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks,
supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got
up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot

Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty
dance, but rather vigorous.
But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he blew three loud hoots.
The noise subsided. _I shall not keep you long,_ he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. _I have
called you all together for a Purpose._ Something in the way that he said this made an impression.
There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.
_Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all, and
that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits._
Tremendous outburst of approval.
_I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as
well as you deserve._ This was unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered clapping,
but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.
_Secondly, to celebrate my birthday._ Cheers again. _I should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of
course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance
today._ Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of 'Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old
Frodo,' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what was meant by
'coming into his inheritance'. _Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were
chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression._ No cheers. This was
ridiculous. Many of his guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure
they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package. 'One Gross,
indeed! Vulgar expression.'
_It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival by barrel
at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was_ my _birthday slipped my memory on
that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was
very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only say 'thag
you very buch'. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party._
Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were
getting bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or
recite. He paused for a moment.
_Thirdly and finally,_ he said, _I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT_. He spoke this last
word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. _I regret to announce that –
though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the END. I
am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!_
He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all blinked.
When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four
flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and
stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins,
Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody,
Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.
It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were
needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. 'He's mad. I always said so,' was probably the
most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo's behaviour was
absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more
than a ridiculous prank.
But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his
wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: 'There's something fishy in this, my dear! I
believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles
with him.' He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.
Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside
Bilbo's empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course,

even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant
surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he
loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo
Baggins' oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath.
Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more wine to be
served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of
the pavilion.
As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering the golden
ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he
slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.
He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in
the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took
off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put
it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn
leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked
drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if
they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour
could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He
then went into his study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a
leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the
top of a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his
golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the
mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment the door opened
and Gandalf came quickly in.
'Hullo!' said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.'
'I am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down in a chair, 'I wanted to catch you
and have a few final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and
according to plan?'
'Yes, I do,' said Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone the
others. A little addition of your own, I suppose?'
It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary to
give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.'
'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' laughed Bilbo, 'but I expect
you know best, as usual.'
'I do – when I know anything. But I don't feel too sure about this whole affair. It has now come
to the final point. You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and
given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you
going any further?'
'Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before. Probably a
permanent holiday: I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all
arrangements.
'I am old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. _Wellpreserved_ indeed!' he snorted. 'Why, I feel all thin, sort of _stretched,_ if you know what I mean:
like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can't be right. I need a change, or
something.'
Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. 'No, it does not seem right,' he said thoughtfully.
'No, after all I believe your plan is probably the best.'
'Well, I've made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, _mountains,_
and then find somewhere where I can _rest._ In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying
around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I

can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: _and he lived happily ever after to the
end of his days. '_
Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.'
'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone. You'll keep
an eye on Frodo, won't you?'
'Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them.'
'He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered to once, just before the
party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the
Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to
be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he
will be happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It's time he was his own master now.'
'Everything?' said Gandalf. 'The ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember.'
'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' stammered Bilbo.
'Where is it?'
'In an envelope, if you must know,' said Bilbo impatiently. 'There on the mantelpiece. Well, no!
Here it is in my pocket!' He hesitated. 'Isn't that odd now?' he said softly to himself. 'Yet after all,
why not? Why shouldn't it stay there?'
Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes. 'I think, Bilbo,' he
said quietly, 'I should leave it behind. Don't you want to?'
'Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at all, I may say. And I don't
really see why I should. Why do you want me to?' he asked, and a curious change came over his
voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance. 'You are always badgering me about my ring;
but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.'
'No, but I had to badger you,' said Gandalf. 'I wanted the truth. It was important. Magic rings are
– well, magical; and they are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may
say; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think
_you_have had it quite long enough. You won't need it any more. Bilbo, unless I am quite
mistaken.'
Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. 'Why not?' he
cried. 'And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my
own. I found it. It came to me.'
'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.'
'If I am it is your fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my
precious.'
The wizard's face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that
he was startled and indeed alarmed. 'It has been called that before,' he said, 'but not by you.'
'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's not his now, but mine.
And I shall keep it, I say.'
Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. 'You will be a fool if you do. Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that
clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can
go yourself, and be free.'
'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' said Bilbo obstinately.
'Now, now, my dear hobbit! ' said Gandalf. 'All your long life we have been friends, and you
owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up! '
'Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you won't get it. I won't give my
precious away, I tell you.' His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.
Gandalf's eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. If you say that again, I
shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.' He took a step towards the hobbit, and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.

Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a
while facing one another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf's eyes remained bent on the
hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.
'I don't know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have never been like this before.
What is it all about? It is mine isn't it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn't kept
it. I'm not a thief, whatever he said.'
'I have never called you one,' Gandalf answered. 'And I am not one either. I am not trying to rob
you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.' He turned away, and the shadow
passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.
Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a
relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately.
Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and
disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking
it up, but I found I couldn't rest without it in my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to
make up my mind.'
'Then trust mine,' said Gandalf. 'It is quite made up. Go away and leave it behind. Stop
possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.'
Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. 'All right,' he said with an
effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. 'After all that's what this
party business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it
easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the end, but it would be a pity
to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil the joke.'
'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,' said Gandalf.
'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo with all the rest.' He drew a deep breath. 'And now I
really must be starting, or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn't bear to
do it all over again.' He picked up his bag and moved to the door.
'You have still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'Well, so I have!' cried Bilbo. 'And
my will and all the other documents too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be
safest.'
'No, don't give the ring to me,' said Gandalf. 'Put it on the mantelpiece. It will be safe enough
there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for him.'
Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his hand jerked back,
and the packet fell on the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set
it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit's face again. Suddenly it gave way to
a look of relief and a laugh. 'Well, that's that,' he said. 'Now I'm off!'
They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand; then he whistled.
Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy.
'Is everything ready?' asked Bilbo. 'Everything packed and labelled?'
'Everything,' they answered.
'Well, let's start then!' He stepped out of the front-door.
It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing the air. 'What
fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been
longing for, for years! Good-bye! ' he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. 'Goodbye, Gandalf!'
'Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise
enough.'
'Take care! I don't care. Don't you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, and
that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,' he added,
and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:

The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.
He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from the lights and
voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his three companions went round into his garden,
and trotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and
took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass.
Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. 'Goodbye, my dear Bilbo –
until our next meeting!' he said softly and went back indoors.
Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought. 'Has he
gone?' he asked.
'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.'
' I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' said Frodo. 'But I knew in
my heart that he really meant to go. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come
back sooner, just to see him off.'
I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said Gandalf. 'Don't be too troubled.
He'll be all right – now. He left a packet for you. There it is!'
Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.
'You'll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,' said the wizard. 'You are the
master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you'll find a golden ring.'
'The ring!' exclaimed Frodo. 'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, it may be useful.'
'It may, and it may not,' said Gandalf. 'I should not make use of it, if I were you. But keep it
secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.'
As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests. Rumours of
strange events had by now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say _no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning_. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by
one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement,
and removed in wheel-barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.
Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People came
and began (by orders) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and
knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs
and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very
small item). Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and
Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the
best-fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not
unexpected.
Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried. He welcomed all
the callers, but he had not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this:
'Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.' Some of the visitors he invited to
come inside, as Bilbo had left 'messages' for them.
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of
furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were several labels of this sort:
_For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo,_ on an umbrella. Adelard had
carried off many unlabelled ones.

_For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo,_ on a
large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo
and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.
_For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.,_ on a gold pen and ink-bottle.
Milo never answered letters.
_For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo,_ on a round convex mirror. She was a young
Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely.
_For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor,_ on an (empty) book-case.
Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning them.
_For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT,_ on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo
believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on his former
journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once,
but she also took the spoons.
This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo's residence had got rather
cluttered up with things in the course of his long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get
cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible.
Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always _new,_ there were one or two old
_mathoms_ of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given
new presents, and kept those that he received. The old hole was now being cleared a little.
Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo, and several
had some point, or some joke. But, of course, most of the things were given where they would be
wanted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old
Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of
ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen
bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had
been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capital fellow after the
first bottle.
There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the chief treasures, as well as
the books, pictures, and more than enough furniture, were left in his possession. There was,
however, no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given
away.
Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household was being
distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no
business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out.
Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make _off_ with minor
items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched. The road to the
gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts.
In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a while
and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see
Frodo, Merry bowed politely.
'He is indisposed,' he said. 'He is resting.'
'Hiding, you mean,' said Lobelia. 'Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him. Just go
and tell him so!'
Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting gift of
spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was
sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed – to see SackvilleBagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he spoke quite
politely.

The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices
(as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the
things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very fishy.
'Only one thing is clear to me,' said Otho, 'and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of
it. I insist on seeing the will.'
Otho would have been Bilbo's heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He read the will carefully and
snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits,
which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).
'Foiled again!' he said to his wife. 'And after waiting _sixty_ years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' He
snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A
little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about
the place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the
premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow
fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really
crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:
'You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too? You don't belong here; you're no
Baggins – you – you're a Brandybuck!'
'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo as he shut the door on her.
'It was a compliment,' said Merry Brandybuck, 'and so, of course, not true.'
Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who
were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho
Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry,
where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both curiosity and hope; for
legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any
one's for the finding – unless the search is interrupted.
When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. It's
time to close the shop, Merry,' he said. 'Lock the door, and don't open it to anyone today, not even
if they bring a battering ram.' Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.
He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. 'Lobelia again most
likely,' he thought. 'She must have thought of something really nasty, and have come back again to
say it. It can wait.'
He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he took no notice. Suddenly
the wizard's head appeared at the window.
'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the
hill,' he said.
'My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!' cried Frodo, running out of the room to the door. 'Come in!
Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.'
'Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a
face that would have curdled new milk.'
'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo's ring. I longed to
disappear.'
'Don't do that!' said Gandalf, sitting down. 'Do be careful of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly
about that that I have come to say a last word.'
'Well, what about it?'
'What do you know already?'
'Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he used it: on his
journey, I mean.'
'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf.

'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo. 'He told me the true story
soon after I came to live here. He said you had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know
too. "No secrets between us, Frodo," he said; "but they are not to go any further. It's mine anyway."'
'That's interesting,' said Gandalf. 'Well, what did you think of it all?'
'If you mean, inventing all that about a "present", well, I thought the true story much more
likely, and I couldn't see the point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway;
and I thought it rather odd.'
'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures – if they use them. Let it
be a warning to you to be very careful with it. It may have other powers than just making you
vanish when you wish to.'
'I don't understand,' said Frodo.
'Neither do I,' answered the wizard. 'I have merely begun to wonder about the ring, especially
since last night. No need to worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at
all. At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again:
keep it safe, and keep it secret!'
'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?'
'I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something when I come back. I
am going off at once: so this is good-bye for the present.' He got up.
'At once!' cried Frodo. 'Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a week. I was looking
forward to your help.'
'I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while; but I'll
come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I
shan't often be visiting the Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say
I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting
Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to
get hold of his wealth.'
'Some people!' exclaimed Frodo. 'You mean Otho and Lobelia. How abominable! I would give
them Bag End and everything else, if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country
with him. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall
ever see him again.'
'So do I,' said Gandalf. 'And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care of yourself!
Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!'
Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a surprising
pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great
weight. The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight.
Frodo did not see him again for a long time.
_Chapter 2_
The Shadow of the Past
The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance of Mr.
Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and
was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and
eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of
jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events
were forgotten.
But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always
been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had

undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The
blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.
'If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he'll settle down and grow
some hobbit-sense,' they said. And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did
settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to
carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a
party in honour of Bilbo's hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast.
But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at
which it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say.
Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo's Birthday
Party year after year until they got used to it. He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When
they asked: 'Where is he then?' he shrugged his shoulders.
He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the
younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and
often in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest
friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was
Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them;
but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes
seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected
that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.
As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good 'preservation':
outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. 'Some
folk have all the luck,' they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age
of fifty that they began to think it queer.
Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and _the_ Mr. Baggins of
Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the
future. But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily
growing. He found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and
strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams. He began to say to
himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.' To which the other half of his mind
always replied: 'Not yet.'
So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty
was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that
adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too
well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the
Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took to wandering further afield and
more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen
walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire.
There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at
that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could.
Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in
the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer
concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The
ancient East-West Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had
always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits' chief
source of news from distant parts – if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits
asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the
West. They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor.

That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of
their memories; but it was ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had
been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of
Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was spreading far and
wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again
in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful
weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no
name.
Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the deafest and most
stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw
strange things. The conversation in _The Green Dragon_ at Bywater, one evening in the spring of
Frodo's fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been
heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.
Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him was Ted Sandyman, the
miller's son; and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk.
'Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said Sam.
'Ah,' said Ted, 'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales and children's stories at home,
if I want to.'
'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay there's more truth in some of them than you
reckon. Who invented the stories anyway? Take dragons now.'
'No thank 'ee,' said Ted, 'I won't. I heard tell of them when I was a youngster, but there's no call
to believe in them now. There's only one Dragon in Bywater, and that's Green,' he said, getting a
general laugh.
'All right,' said Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But what about these Tree-men, these giants, as you
might call them? They do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North
Moors not long back.'
'Who's _they_?'
'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up to the Northfarthing
for the hunting. He _saw_ one.'
'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal's always saying he's seen things; and maybe he sees things that
ain't there.'
'But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking – walking seven yards to a stride, if it was
an inch.'
'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw _was_ an elm tree, as like as not.'
'But this one was _walking,_ I tell you; and there ain't no elm tree on the North Moors.'
'Then Hal can't have seen one,' said Ted. There was some laughing and clapping: the audience
seemed to think that Ted had scored a point.
'All the same,' said Sam, 'you can't deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk
crossing the Shire – crossing it, mind you: there are more that are turned back at the borders. The
Bounders have never been so busy before.
'And I've heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are going to the harbours, out
away beyond the White Towers.' Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew
how far it was to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an
old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail,
never to return.
'They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into the West and leaving us,' said
Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.
'Well, that isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I don't see what it matters to me
or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.'

'Well I don't know,' said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods,
and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such
fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always
moved him most deeply. 'There are some, even in these parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news
of them,' he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they were sailing and
he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many's the talk I had with him when I
was a little lad.'
'Oh, they're both cracked,' said Ted. 'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo's cracking. If
that's where you get your news from, you'll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I'm off home.
Your good health!' He drained his mug and went out noisily.
Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For one thing, there was a
lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared.
The grass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he
sighed, and got up and went out.
It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool
pale evening was quietly fading into night. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton
and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.
It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after the
Party he had been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he
went off again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly
after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business
and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings.
Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of
him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in
hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once
familiar tap on the study window.
Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard at one another.
'Ah well eh?' said Gandalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!'
'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn.
He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and
they stayed up far into the night.
Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of
the study. A bright fire was on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South.
Everything looked fresh, and the new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips
of the trees' fingers.
Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag
End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and
eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as
bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight.
He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in the light of
morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the
silence.
'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,' he said. 'And then you
stopped, because you said that such matters were best left until daylight. Don't you think you had
better finish now? You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what way?'
'In many ways,' answered the wizard. It is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first,
so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It
would possess him.

'In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, and they were,
of course, of various kinds: some more potent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in
the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles – yet still to my
mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they were perilous.
'A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain
more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the
Ring to make himself invisible, he_ fades:_ he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and
walks in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later –
later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last –
sooner or later the dark power will devour him.'
'How terrifying!' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting
the lawn came in from the garden.
'How long have you known this?' asked Frodo at length. 'And how much did Bilbo know?'
'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf. 'He would certainly never have
passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger, even though I promised to look after
you. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or
queer, it was himself. He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was always worrying about
it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he had found out that the thing
needed looking after; it did not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an
odd way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.'
'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo, 'so I have always kept it on its chain.'
'Very wise,' said Gandalf. 'But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected it with the ring at all.
He took all the credit for that to himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting
restless and uneasy. _Thin and stretched_ he said. A sign that the ring was getting control.'
'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again.
'Known?' said Gandalf. 'I have known much that only the Wise know, Frodo. But if you mean
"known about _this_ ring", well, I still do not _know,_one might say. There is a last test to make.
But I no longer doubt my guess.
'When did I first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back in memory. 'Let me see – it was in
the year that the White Council drove the dark power from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five
Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what
I feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was – that at least was
clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story of how he had "won" it, and I could not
believe it. When I at last got the truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his
claim to the ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his "birthday present". The lies were too
much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its
keeper at once. That was the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that
such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little else that I
could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so
anyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but
something always held me back.'
'Who is he?' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.'
'Maybe not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits are, or were, no concern of his. Yet he is great among
the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his
pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small,
is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making; but when the Rings
were debated in the Council, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So
my doubt slept – but uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.

'And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they passed, and they seemed not to
touch him. He showed no signs of age. The shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: "After
all he comes of a long-lived family on his mother's side. There is time yet. Wait!"
'And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and did things then that filled me
with a fear that no words of Saruman could allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was
at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.'
'There wasn't any permanent harm done, was there?' asked Frodo anxiously. 'He would get all
right in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in peace, I mean?'
'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf. 'But there is only one Power in this world that knows all
about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all
about hobbits. Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of
knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old treeroots. I think it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would
believe. I don't think you need worry about Bilbo.
'Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it might take a long while for
the influence to wear off – before it was safe for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he
might live on for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he gave it up
in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more,
once he had let the thing go. It is for _you_ that I feel responsible.
'Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and about all these charming,
absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the
Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not to
mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.'
Frodo shuddered. 'But why should we be?' he asked. 'And why should he want such slaves?'
'To tell you the truth,' replied Gandalf, 'I believe that hitherto – _hitherto,_mark you – he has
entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed.
He does not need you – he has many more useful servants – but he won't forget you again. And
hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and free. There is such a
thing as malice and revenge.'
'Revenge?' said Frodo. 'Revenge for what? I still don't understand what all this has to do with
Bilbo and myself, and our ring.'
'It has everything to do with it,' said Gandalf. 'You do not know the real peril yet; but you shall. I
was not sure of it myself when I was last here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for
a moment.'
Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt.
He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or
Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it.
Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. 'Can you see any markings on
it?' he asked.
'No,' said Frodo. 'There are none. It is quite plain, and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear.'
'Well then, look!' To Frodo's astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the
middle of a glowing corner of the fire. Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held
him back.
'Wait!' he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling
brows.
No apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters
outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room became dark and silent, though the clack of
Sam's shears, now nearer to the windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. For a

moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth
with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped.
It is quite cool,' said Gandalf. 'Take it!' Frodo received it on his shrinking palm: it seemed to
have become thicker and heavier than ever.
'Hold it up!' said Gandalf. 'And look closely!'
As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest pen-strokes, running along the ring,
outside and inside: lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone
piercingly bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth.
'I cannot read the fiery letters,' said Frodo in a quavering voice.
'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient mode, but the language is that
of Mordor, which I will not utter here. But this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close
enough:
_One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them._
It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:
_Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.'_
He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: 'This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule
them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He
greatly desires it – but he must _not_ get it.'
Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand, like a dark cloud rising
in the East and looming up to engulf him. 'This ring!' he stammered. 'How, how on earth did it
come to me?'
'Ah!' said Gandalf. 'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back in the Black Years, which
only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here
when Spring had passed into Winter.
'But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The rumours that you have heard
are true: he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient
fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on
the borders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and
grows again.'
'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo.
'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to
decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given, us. And already, Frodo, our
time is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from
ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even
if it were not for this dreadful chance.

'The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance,
break the last defences, and cover all the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.
'The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand never touched them or sullied
them. Seven the Dwarf-kings possessed, but three he has recovered, and the others the dragons
have consumed. Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago
they fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great
Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet
who knows? As the Shadow grows once more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not
speak of such things even in the morning of the Shire.
'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed. The
Three are hidden still. But that no longer troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that
Ring himself, it is his, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that he could
rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them all again, wherever they be, even
the Three, and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than
ever.
'And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had perished; that the Elves
had destroyed it, as should have been done. But he knows now that it has _not_ perished, that it has
been found. So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and
our great fear.'
'Why, why wasn't it destroyed?' cried Frodo. 'And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it, if he
was so strong, and it was so precious to him?' He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already
dark fingers stretching out to seize it.
'It was taken from him,' said Gandalf. 'The strength of the Elves to resist him was greater long
ago; and not all Men were estranged from them. The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is
a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and
gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I will
tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best.
'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you, and that
will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of
Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished in the deed; and Isildur
Elendil's son cut the Ring from Sauron's hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished
and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.
'But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and vanished. For Isildur was
marching north along the east banks of the River, and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by
the Orcs of the Mountains, and almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the
Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows.'
Gandalf paused. 'And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,' he said, 'the Ring passed
out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of its history is known now only to a few, and the
Council of the Wise could discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think.
'Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of
Wilderland a clever-handed and quiet-footed little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to
the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little
boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than
most, and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had.
The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Sméagol. He was interested in
roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he
tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the
flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.

'He had a friend called Déagol, of similar sort, sharper-eyed but not so quick and strong. On a
time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and
flowering reeds. There Sméagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat
and fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he knew where he was, he was dragged
out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let go of his line, for he thought he saw
something shining in the river-bed; and holding his breath he grabbed at it.
'Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud; and he swam to the
bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring;
and it shone and glittered in the sun, so that his heart was glad. But Sméagol had been watching
him from behind a tree, and as Deal gloated over the ring, Sméagol came softly up behind.
'"Give us that, Deal, my love," said Sméagol, over his friend's shoulder.
'"Why?" said Deal.
' "Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it," said Sméagol.
'"I don't care," said Deal. "I have given you a present already, more than I could afford. I found
this, and I'm going to keep it."
' "Oh, are you indeed, my love," said Sméagol; and he caught Deal by the throat and strangled
him, because the gold looked so bright and beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.
'No one ever found out what had become of Deal; he was murdered far from home, and his body
was cunningly hidden. But Sméagol returned alone; and he found that none of his family could see
him, when he was wearing the ring. He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it;
and he used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. He
became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him power
according to his stature. It is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned
(when visible) by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to thieving, and
going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat. So they called him _Gollum,_ and
cursed him, and told him to go far away; and his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from
the family and turned him out of her hole.
'He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the world, and he journeyed up
the River, till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way. He
caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as
he was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head) and a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for
the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her.
'But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the Misty Mountains, out of which the
stream came. And he thought suddenly: "It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The
Sun could not watch me there. The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be
great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning."
'So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little cave out of which the dark
stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all
knowledge. The Ring went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had
begun to grow again, could learn nothing of it.'
'Gollum!' cried Frodo. 'Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very Gollum-creature that Bilbo
met? How loathsome!'
'I think it is a sad story,' said the wizard, 'and it might have happened to others, even to some
hobbits that I have known.'
'I can't believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,' said Frodo with
some heat. 'What an abominable notion!'
'It is true all the same,' replied Gandalf. 'About their origins, at any rate, I know more than
hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo's story suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the

background of their minds and memories that was very similar. They understood one another
remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even
an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for one thing.'
'Yes,' said Frodo. 'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and of much the same sort.
And hobbits don't cheat. Gollum meant to cheat all the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo
off his guard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing
him with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.'
'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf. 'But there was something else in it, I think, which you don't
see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise
would have guessed -as a hobbit might. There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own,
and light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the past. It was actually
pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on
the grass, and such forgotten things.
'But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end – unless it could be
conquered. Unless it could be cured.' Gandalf sighed. 'Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet
not no hope. No, not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember.
For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom needed. Certainly he
had never "faded". He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and
the torment had become almost unbearable.
'All the "great secrets" under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night: there was
nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering.
He was altogether wretched. He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and
the Ring most of all.'
'What do you mean?' said Frodo. 'Surely the Ring was his precious and the only thing he cared
for? But if he hated it, why didn't he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?'
'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,' said Gandalf. 'He hated it
and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the
matter.
'A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. _It_ may slip off treacherously, but its keeper never
abandons it. At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone else's care – and that only
at an early stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever
gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never
have just forsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided
things. The Ring left _him.'_
'What, just in time to meet Bilbo?' said Frodo. 'Wouldn't an Orc have suited it better?'
'It is no laughing matter,' said Gandalf. 'Not for you. It was the strangest event in the whole
history of the Ring so far: Bilbo's arrival just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the
dark.
'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to get back to its master.
It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor Deal,
and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had devoured him. It could make no further use
of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep
pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from
Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable:
Bilbo from the Shire!
'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker. I can put it
no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was _meant_to find the Ring, and _not_ by its maker. In which
case you also were _meant_to have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.'
It is not,' said Frodo. "Though I am not sure that I understand you. But how have you learned all
this about the Ring, and about Gollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?'

Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much and I have learned much,' he
answered. 'But I am not going to give an account of all my doings to _you._ The history of Elendil
and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by
the fire-writing alone, apart from any other evidence.' 'And when did you discover that?' asked
Frodo, interrupting. 'Just now in this room, of course,' answered the wizard sharply. 'But I expected
to find it. I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last
proof, and all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum's part, and fitting it into the gap in the
history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses about Gollum, but I am not
guessing now. I know. I have seen him.'
'You have seen Gollum?' exclaimed Frodo in amazement.
'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long ago; but I have managed it at
last.'
'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?'
'Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell – though not, of course,
in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he
called the Ring his "birthday present", and he stuck to that. He said it came from his grandmother,
who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous story. I have no doubt that Sméagol's
grandmother was a matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elvenrings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of truth.
'The murder of Deal haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, repeating it to his
"precious" over and over again, as he gnawed bones in the dark, until he almost believed it. It
_was_ his birthday. Deal ought to have given the ring to him. It had previously turned up just so as
to be a present. It _was_ his birthday present, and so on, and on.
I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately important, and in the end I had to
be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with
much snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But when he had at
last told me his history, as far as the end of the Riddle-game and Bilbo's escape, he would not say
any more, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he
was going to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a
hole and then _robbed._ Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong. They would
help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his
name. What is more, he knew where he came from.'
'But how did he find that out?' asked Frodo.
'Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and after that it would not be
difficult to discover his country, once Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the
Ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the
mountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no longer devouring him; he
began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry.
'Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always will, I think; but he was
cunning. He found he could hide from daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and
softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. He
grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into Mirkwood, as one
would expect.'
'Is that where you found him?' asked Frodo.
'I saw him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo's trail.
It was difficult to learn anything from him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by
curses and threats. "What had it got in its pocketses?" he said. "It wouldn't say, no precious. Little
cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed it,
yes precious. And we will, precious!"

'That is a sample of his talk. I don't suppose you want any more. I had weary days of it. But from
hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to
Esgaroth, and even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great
events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo's name and knew where he
came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West. Gollum's sharp
ears would soon learn what he wanted.'
'Then why didn't he track Bilbo further?' asked Frodo. 'Why didn't he come to the Shire?'
'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set out and came back
westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I
am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me.
'The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail was still fresh then.
Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though they never caught him. The wood was full
of the rumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds. The Woodmen said that there
was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into
holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find cradles.
'But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered off southwards and
passed out of the Wood-elves' ken, and was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and
not the first; though I fear it may prove the worst. I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much
else to think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman.
'Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days. The trail
was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in
vain, but for the help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this
age of the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of Wilderland, without
hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given up the chase and turned to other parts,
Gollum was found. My friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with
him.
'What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us cruel, with many a
_gollum_ in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long
hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am
afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by mile,
south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.'
A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. Even outside everything
seemed still. No sound of Sam's shears could now be heard.
'Yes, to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, and the Dark Power was
bending all its will to gather them there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave
him open to the summons. And all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and
its hatred of the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his revenge!
'Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And sooner or later
as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught, and taken – for examination. That was
the way of it, I fear. When he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back.
On some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief was done.
'Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows
where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it
gave long life. He knows that it is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they
endure no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for. He
knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of _hobbits_ and the _Shire._
'The Shire – he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found out where it lies. Indeed,
Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the long-unnoticed name of _Baggins_ has become
important.'

'But this is terrible!' cried Frodo. 'Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and
warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to
do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!'
'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has
been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,
because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.'
'I am sorry,' said Frodo. 'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.'
'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.
'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and
the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc,
and just an enemy. He deserves death.'
'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very
wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is
a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part
to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate
of many – yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The
Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise
hearts.'
'All the same,' said Frodo, 'even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring.
I wish he had never found it, and that I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn't you
make me throw it away, or, or destroy it?'
'Let you? Make you?' said the wizard. 'Haven't you been listening to all that I have said? You are
not thinking of what you are saying. But as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These
Rings have a way of being found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst of all, it might
have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is
exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself.
'Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me deeply. But there
was so much at stake that I had to take some risk – though even when I was far away there has
never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used
it, I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for
a very long time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew
little for certain.'
'But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?' cried Frodo again. If you
had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would have done away with it.'
'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?'
'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.'
'Try!' said Gandalf. Try now!'
Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now appeared plain and smooth,
without mark or device that he could see. The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought
how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing and
altogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest
part of the fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed
the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and
then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away – but he found that he had put
it back in his pocket.
Gandalf laughed grimly. 'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let it go, nor will to
damage it. And I could not "make" you – except by force, which would break your mind. But as for
breaking the Ring, force is useless. Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it
would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine.

'Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This Ring has already passed
through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there is no smith's forge in this Shire that could
change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that
dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on
earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the
Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron
himself. There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Firemountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of
the Enemy for ever.'
'I do really wish to destroy it!' cried Frodo. 'Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for
perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?'
'Such questions cannot be answered,' said Gandalf. 'You may be sure that it was not for any
merit that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen,
and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.'
'But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful. Will you not take the
Ring?'
'No!' cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. 'With that power I should have power too great and
terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly.' His eyes flashed
and his face was lit as by a fire within. 'Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark
Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of
strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish
to wield it would be too great, for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie before
me.'
He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. Sunlight streamed back
again into the room. Sam passed along the path outside whistling. 'And now,' said the wizard,
turning back to Frodo, 'the decision lies with you. But I will always help you.' He laid his hand on
Frodo's shoulder. 'I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours to bear. But we must do
something, soon. The Enemy is moving.'
There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought.
His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at
the red embers on the hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into
profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery
Mountain.
'Well!' said Gandalf at last. 'What are you thinking about? Have you decided what to do?'
'No!' answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to his surprise that it
was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden. 'Or perhaps, yes. As far as
I understand what you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the
present, whatever it may do to me.'
'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,' said Gandalf.
'I hope so,' said Frodo. 'But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon. But in the
meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and
stay here. I ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.' He sighed.
'I should like to save the Shire, if I could – though there have been times when I thought the
inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons
might be good for them. But I don't feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind,
safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a
firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.
'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind of holiday, a
series of adventures like Bilbo's or better, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from

danger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save
the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well – desperate. The Enemy is so strong
and terrible.'
He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his
heart – to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his
fear: he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done
on a similar morning long ago.
'My dear Frodo!' exclaimed Gandalf. 'Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said
before. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even from
you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important it
would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much
longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of
Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild. I will give
you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.
'But I don't think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can trust, and who would
be willing to go by your side – and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils. But if
you look for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your
closest friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.'
Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside and
outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a
long arm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee's curly head hauled
by one ear.
'Well, well, bless my beard!' said Gandalf. 'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what may you be doing?'
'Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!' said Sam. 'Nothing! Leastways I was just trimming the grassborder under the window, if you follow me.' He picked up his shears and exhibited them as
evidence.
'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears. How
long have you been eavesdropping?'
'Eavesdropping, sir? I don't follow you, begging your pardon. There ain't no eaves at Bag End,
and that's a fact.'
'Don't be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?' Gandalf's eyes flashed and his
brows stuck out like bristles.
'Mr. Frodo, sir!' cried Sam quaking. 'Don't let him hurt me, sir! Don't let him turn me into
anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!'
'He won't hurt you,' said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although he was himself
startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and
answer his questions straight away!'
'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't rightly understand, about an
enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and – and Elves, sir. I
listened because I couldn't help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do love
tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to
see _them._ Couldn't you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?'
Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'Come inside!' he shouted, and putting out both his arms he lifted the
astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, right through the window and stood him on the
floor. 'Take you to see Elves, eh?' he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his
face. 'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?'
'I did, sir. And that's why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I tried not to, sir, but it burst out
of me: I was so upset.'

'It can't be helped, Sam,' said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized that flying from the Shire
would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End.
'I shall have to go. But' – and here he looked hard at Sam – 'if you really care about me, you will
keep that _dead_ secret. See? If you don't, if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here,
then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.'
Sam fell on his knees, trembling. 'Get up, Sam!' said Gandalf. I have thought of something better
than that. Something to shut your mouth, and punish you properly for listening. You shall go away
with Mr. Frodo!'
'Me, sir!' cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. 'Me go and see Elves and all!
Hooray!' he shouted, and then burst into tears.
_Chapter 3_
Three is Company
'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,' said Gandalf. Two or three weeks had
passed, and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to go.
'I know. But it is difficult to do both,' he objected. If I just vanish like Bilbo, the tale will be all
over the Shire in no time.'
'Of course you mustn't vanish!' said Gandalf. 'That wouldn't do at all! I said _soon,_ not
_instantly._ If you can think of any way of slipping out of the Shire without its being generally
known, it will be worth a little delay. But you must not delay too long.'
'What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?' asked Frodo. 'I think I could probably make
some arrangements by then.'
To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come to the point. Bag End
seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years, and he wanted to savour as much as he
could of his last summer in the Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart
would think more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed privately
made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo's one hundred and twenty-eighth. It
seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him. Following Bilbo was
uppermost in his mind, and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as
little as possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did not tell all his
thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell.
He looked at Frodo and smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'I think that will do – but it must not be any
later. I am getting very anxious. In the mean-while, do take care, and don't let out any hint of where
you are going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him into a
toad.'
'As for _where I_ am going,' said Frodo, 'it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no
clear idea myself, yet.'
'Don't be absurd!' said Gandalf. 'I am not warning you against leaving an address at the postoffice! But you are leaving the Shire – and that should not be known, until you are far away. And
you must go, or at least set out, either North, South, West or East – and the direction should
certainly not be known.'
'I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of saying farewell, that I
have never even considered the direction,' said Frodo. 'For where am I to go? And by what shall I
steer? What is to be my quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again; but I go to lose
one, and not return, as far as I can see.'
'But you cannot see very far,' said Gandalf. 'Neither can I. It may be your task to find the Cracks
of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do not know. At any rate you are not ready for that
long road yet.'

'No indeed!' said Frodo. 'But in the meantime what course am I to lake?'
'Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,' answered the wizard. 'If you want my
advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not prove too perilous, though the Road is less
easy than it was, and it will grow worse as the year fails.'
'Rivendell!' said Frodo. 'Very good: I will go east, and I will make for Rivendell. I will take Sam
to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.' He spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a
desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of
the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.
One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news reached the _Ivy Bush_ and _Green
Dragon._ Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were forgotten for more important
matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed he had already sold it – to the Sackville-Bagginses!
'For a nice bit, loo,' said some. 'At a bargain price,' said others, 'and that's more likely when
Mistress Lobelia's the buyer.' (Otho had died some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of
102.)
Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price. A
few held the theory – supported by the nods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself – that Frodo's money
was running out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale
down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. 'As far from the Sackville-Bagginses as may
be,' some added. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of
Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that
their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though
he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in
the Bag End'. But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no
doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.
'Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,' he said. 'Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little
hole for me, or perhaps a small house.'
As a matter of fact with Merry's help he had already chosen and bought a little house at
Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle
down there permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for
Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his going
back would at least seem credible.
Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at the end of June, soon
after Frodo's plan had been finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again
next morning. 'Only for a short while, I hope,' he said. 'But I am going down beyond the southern
borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.'
He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. 'Has anything happened?'
he asked.
'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into. If I think
it necessary after all for you to get off at once, I shall come back immediately, or at least send
word. In the meanwhile stick to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the Ring.
Let me impress on you once more: _don't use it!'_
He went off at dawn. 'I may be back any day,' he said. 'At the very latest I shall come back for
the farewell party. I think after all you may need my company on the Road.'
At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard;
but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire
had seldom seen so fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey
was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full.
Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again. September was
passing and there was still no news of him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he

did not come, or send word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo's friends came to stay and
help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special
friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned the whole place upsidedown.
On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, conveying the furniture and
goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge. The next day
Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday
morning, dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still Gandalf did not
appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner for himself
and his four helpers; but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought that he would so
soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he would break it
to them.
The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very
cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence. The dining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but
the food was good, and there was good wine: Frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the
Sackville-Bagginses.
'Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get their claws on it, at any rate I
have found a good home for this!' said Frodo, as he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old
Winyards.
When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done together, they
toasted Bilbo's birthday, and they drank his health and Frodo's together according to Frodo's
custom. Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed.
Frodo's party was over, and Gandalf had not come.
The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage. Merry
took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger). 'Someone must get there and
warm the house before you arrive,' said Merry. 'Well, see you later – the day after tomorrow, if you
don't go to sleep on the way!'
Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was restless and anxious,
listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf. He decided to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf
wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was
going on foot. His plan – for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any other reason – was
to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry, taking it fairly easy.
'I shall get myself a bit into training, too,' he said, looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the
half-empty hall. He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked
rather flabby, he thought.
After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much
to Frodo's annoyance. 'Ours at last!' said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor
strictly true, for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be
forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for Bag End than she once
hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. Anyway, she had come to see that nothing she had
paid for had been carried off; and she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she
had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she departed with
Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the Gamgees' in
Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering
the hole during the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.
He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had been officially
announced that Sam was coming to Buckland 'to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden';
an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of
having Lobelia as a neighbour.

'Our last meal at Bag End!' said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They left the washing up for
Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out
for a last stroll in the garden. Sam disappeared.
The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. Frodo wandered round
the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the
corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the
path, and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half expected to see Gandalf come striding
up through the dusk.
The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. 'It's going to be a fine night,' he said aloud.
'That's good for a beginning. I feel like walking. I can't bear any more hanging about. I am going to
start, and Gandalf must follow me.' He turned to go back, and then slopped, for he heard voices,
just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was certainly the old Gaffer's; the
other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what it said, but he heard the
Gaffer's answers, which were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out.
'No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went with him: anyway all
his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, I tell'ee. Why? Why's none of my business, or yours. Where
to? That ain't no secret. He's moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is
– a tidy way. I've never been so far myself; they're queer folks in Buckland. No, I can't give no
message. Good night to you!'
Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not
come on up the Hill seemed a great relief. 'I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings, I
suppose,' he thought. 'What an inquisitive lot they all are!' He had half a mind to go and ask the
Gaffer who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and walked quickly
back to Bag End.
Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo stepped inside the dark
door. 'Sam!' he called. 'Sam! Time!'
'Coming, sir!' came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam himself, wiping his
mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer-barrel in the cellar.
'All aboard, Sam?' said Frodo.
'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.'
Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam. 'Run down with this to your
home, Sam!' he said. 'Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the
lane beyond the meadows. We are not going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking
and eyes prying.' Sam ran off at full speed.
'Well, now we're off at last!' said Frodo. They shouldered their packs and took up their sticks,
and walked round the corner to the west side of Bag End. 'Good-bye!' said Frodo, looking at the
dark blank windows. He waved his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it)
hurried after Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the
bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses.
At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane.
There they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly
and breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head a
tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf.
'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said Frodo. 'I pity snails, and all that carry
their homes on their backs.'
'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam stoutly and untruthfully.
'No, you don't, Sam!' said Pippin. 'It is good for him. He's got nothing except what he ordered us
to pack. He's been slack lately, and he'll feel the weight less when he's walked off some of his own.'
'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!' laughed Frodo. 'I shall be as thin as a willow-wand, I'm sure,
before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more than your

share, Sam, and I shall look into it at our next packing.' He picked up his stick again. 'Well, we all
like walking in the dark,' he said, 'so let's put some miles behind us before bed.'
For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they turned left and took
quietly to the fields again. They went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices,
and night fell dark about them. In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic
rings. Since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no noise that even
hobbits would hear. Even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing.
After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow plank-bridge. The
stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile or
two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in
the Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country. As they began to
climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle
valley of the Water. Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by
Bywater beside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the
trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.
'I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,' he said quietly.
When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was clear, cool, and starry,
but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows.
Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky.
They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they struck a narrow
road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and
Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away from the main road in the Water-valley, and
wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner of the Eastfarthing.
After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry
leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being
now far away from inquisitive ears. Then they marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag
behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and yawned.
'I am so sleepy,' he said, 'that soon I shall fall down on the road. Are you going to sleep on your
legs? It is nearly midnight.'
'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo. 'But there is no great hurry. Merry expects
us some time the day after tomorrow; but that leaves us nearly two days more. We'll halt at the first
likely spot.'
'The wind's in the West,' said Sam. 'If we get to the other side of this hill, we shall find a spot
that is sheltered and snug enough, sir. There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.'
Sam knew the land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his geography.
Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. Leaving the road they went into
the deep resin-scented darkness of the trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire.
Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it for a
while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great tree's roots, they curled up in
their cloaks and blankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no
danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at them
when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped
several minutes and sniffed.
'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in this land, but I have
seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree. Three of them! There's something
mighty queer behind this.' He was quite right, but he never found out any more about it.
The morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that a tree-root had made
a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff.

'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't I drive?' he thought, as he usually did at the beginning of an
expedition. 'And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots
would do them good.' He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.'
'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye. 'Sam!
Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you got the bath-water hot?'
Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. 'No, sir, I haven't, sir!' he said.
Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of
the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world.
Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little
below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared.
When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' shouted Pippin. 'Where's
the water?'
'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo. 'We thought you had gone to find some,' said
Pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups. 'You had better go now.'
'You can come too,' said Frodo, 'and bring all the water-bottles.' There was a stream at the foot
of the hill. They filled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a
few feet over an outcrop of grey stone. It was icy cold; and they spluttered and puffed as they
bathed their faces and hands.
When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it was after ten o'clock, and
the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They went down the slope, and across the stream where
it dived under the road, and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and
by that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed a heavy burden.
The day's march promised to be warm and tiring work. After some miles, however, the road
ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way,
and then prepared to go down for the last time. In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze. They were
looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine River. The road wound away before them
like a piece of string.
'The road goes on for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest. It is high time for lunch.' He
sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay
the River, and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round
eyes were wide open – for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon.
'Do Elves live in those woods?' he asked.
'Not that I ever heard,' said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was gazing eastward along the road,
as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:
The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with weary feet,
Until it joins some larger way,
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.
'That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming,' said Pippin. 'Or is it one of your imitations? It
does not sound altogether encouraging.'
'I don't know,' said Frodo. It came to me then, as if I was making it up; but I may have heard it
long ago. Certainly it reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He
used often to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every

doorstep, and every path was its tributary. "It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your
door," he used to say. "You step into the Road, and if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing
where you might be swept off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through
Mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to
worse places?" He used to say that on the path outside the front door at Bag End, especially after he
had been out for a long walk.'
'Well, the Road won't sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,' said Pippin, unslinging his pack.
The others followed his example, putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the
road. After a rest they had a good lunch, and then more rest.
The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down
the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit
for carts, and there was little traffic to the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an
hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level ground, and the
road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of
the approaching woods.
'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam.
They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. 'I wonder if that is
Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and
a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.
'It may not matter much,' he said apologetically, 'but I would rather not be seen on the road – by
anyone. I am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,' he added as an
afterthought, 'we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out of
sight!'
The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road. There
they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his
desire to hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of
long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously
above one of the great roots.
Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized horse; and on it sat a large
man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his
boots in the high stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible.
When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite
still with its head bowed, as if listening. From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing
to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from side to side of the road.
A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he thought of his Ring. He
hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began
slowly to move his hand. He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The
advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. 'And I am still in the Shire,' he thought,
as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At that moment the rider sat up, and shook the
reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot.
Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he dwindled into the distance.
He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the
horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right.
'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards
his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo
described the rider and his strange behaviour.
'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or _smelling_ for me; and also I felt certain
that I did not want him to discover me. I've never seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.'
'But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?' said Pippin. 'And what is he doing in this
part of the world?'

'There are some Men about,' said Frodo. 'Down in the Southfarthing they have had trouble with
Big People, I believe. But I have never heard of anything like this rider. I wonder where he comes
from.'
'Begging your pardon,' put in Sam suddenly, 'I know where he comes from. It's from Hobbiton
that this here black rider comes, unless there's more than one. And I know where he's going to.'
'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. 'Why didn't you speak
up before?'
'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to our hole yesterday evening
with the key, my dad, he says to me: _Hello, Sam!_ he says. _I thought you were away with Mr.
Frodo this morning. There's been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he's
only just gone. I've sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed
mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did.
It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was he?_ says I to the Gaffer. _I don't know,_
says he; _but he wasn't a hobbit. He was tall and black-like, and he stooped aver me. I reckon it was
one of the Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny._
'I couldn't stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I didn't give much heed to it
myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when
this fellow come up the Hill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn't
done no harm, sir, nor me.'
'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo. 'As a matter of fact I heard him talking to a
stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I
had, or you had told me about it before. I might have been more careful on the road.'
'Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer's stranger,' said Pippin. 'We
left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don't see how he could have followed us.'
'What about the _smelling,_ sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a black chap.'
'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered. 'But perhaps it would only have made matters
worse.'
'Then you know or guess something about this rider?' said Pippin, who had caught the muttered
words.
'I don't know, and I would rather not guess,' said Frodo. 'All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep
your secret for the present, if you want to be mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I
should like a bite and a sup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of
sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.'
'Yes, I think we will move on now,' said Frodo; 'but not on the road -in case that rider comes
back, or another follows him. We ought to do a good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.'
The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they started off again. They now
kept a stone's throw to the left of the road, and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But this
hindered them; for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees began to
draw together into thickets.
The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening was coming on before
they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some
miles. At that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a
lane branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to Woodhall. 'That is
the way for us,' said Frodo.
Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it was still alive and had
leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs;
but it was hollow, and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road. The
hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood. They rested and
had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from time to time.

Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind was sighing in the
branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A
star came out above the trees in the darkening East before them. They went abreast and in step, to
keep up their spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the feeling of disquiet left
them, and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have
a way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With
most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though
not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a
tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Watervalley and talked about Adventure.
Upon the hearth the fire is red,
Beneath the roof there is a bed;
But not yet weary are our feet,
Still round the corner we may meet
A sudden tree or standing stone
That none have seen but we alone.
Tree and flower and leaf and grass,
Let them pass! Let them pass!
Hill and water under sky,
Pass them by! Pass them by!
Still round the corner there may wait
A new road or a secret gate,
And though we pass them by today,
Tomorrow we may come this way
And take the hidden paths that run
Towards the Moon or to the Sun.
Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe,
Let them go! Let them go!
Sand and stone and pool and dell,
Fare you well! Fare you well!
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread
Through shadows to the edge of night,
Until the stars are all alight.
Then world behind and home ahead,
We'll wander back to home and bed.
Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,
Away shall fade! Away shall fade!
Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,
And then to bed! And then to bed!
The song ended. 'And _now_ to bed! And _now_ to bed!' sang Pippin in a high voice.
'Hush!' said Frodo. 'I think I hear hoofs again.'
They slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. There was a sound of
hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly
they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under the oak-trees.

'Don't let us go too far!' said Frodo. 'I don't want to be seen, but I want to see if it is another
Black Rider.'
'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!'
The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general
darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back
a few yards towards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood.
Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.
The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter
space between two trees, and then halt. It looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller
black shadow. The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it
swayed from side to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. The shadow bent to the
ground, and then began to crawl towards him.
Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time it was stronger than
before. So strong that, almost before he realized what he was doing, his hand was groping in his
pocket. But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose
and fell in the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated. It climbed on to the
shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side. Frodo
breathed again.
'Elves!' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. 'Elves, sir!' He would have burst out of the trees and
dashed off towards the voices, if they had not pulled him back.
'Yes, it is Elves,' said Frodo. 'One can meet them sometimes in the Woody End. They don't live
in the Shire, but they wander into it in Spring and Autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the
Tower Hills. I am thankful that they do! You did not see, but that Black Rider stopped just here and
was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he heard the voices he slipped
away.'
'What about the Elves?' said Sam, too excited to trouble about the rider. 'Can't we go and see
them?'
'Listen! They are coming this way,' said Frodo. 'We have only to wait.' The singing drew nearer.
One clear voice rose now above the others. It was singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo
knew only a little, and the others knew nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to
shape itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood. This was the song as
Frodo heard it:
Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!
O Queen beyond the Western Seas!
O Light to us that wander here
Amid the world of woven trees!
Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!
Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee
In a far land beyond the Sea.
O stars that in the Sunless Year
With shining hand by her were sawn,
In windy fields now bright and clear
We see your silver blossom blown!
O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!
We still remember, we who dwell

In this far land beneath the trees,
Thy starlight on the Western Seas.
The song ended. 'These are High Elves! They spoke the name of Elbereth!' said Frodo in
amazement, 'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middleearth, east of the Great Sea. This is indeed a strange chance!'
The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elves came down the lane towards
the valley. They passed slowly, and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and
in their eyes. They bore no lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like the light of the moon above
the rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were now silent, and as the
last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed.
'Hail, Frodo!' he cried. 'You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps lost?' Then he called aloud to
the others, and all the company stopped and gathered round.
'This is indeed wonderful!' they said. 'Three hobbits in a wood at night! We have not seen such a
thing since Bilbo went away. What is the meaning of it?'
'The meaning of it, fair people,' said Frodo, 'is simply that we seem to be going the same way as
you are. I like walking under the stars. But I would welcome your company.'
'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,' they laughed. 'And how do you
know that we go the same way as you, for you do not know whither we are going?'
'And how do you know my name?' asked Frodo in return.
'We know many things,' they said. 'We have seen you often before with Bilbo, though you may
not have seen us.'
'Who are you, and who is your lord?' asked Frodo.
'I am Gildor,' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. 'Gildor Inglorion of the
House of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are
now only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some of our kinsfolk dwell
still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing? For we see that there is
some shadow of fear upon you.'
'O Wise People!' interrupted Pippin eagerly. 'Tell us about the Black Riders!'
'Black Riders?' they said in low voices. 'Why do you ask about Black Riders?'
'Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so twice,' said Pippin; 'only
a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near.'
The Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their own tongue. At length
Gildor turned to the hobbits. 'We will not speak of this here,' he said. 'We think you had best come
now with us. It is not our custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall
lodge with us tonight, if you will.'
'O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said Pippin. Sam was speechless. 'I thank
you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing. _'Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo,_ a star shines on
the hour of our meeting,' he added in the high-elven speech.
'Be careful, friends!' cried Gildor laughing. 'Speak no secrets! Here is a scholar in the Ancient
Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail, Elf-friend!' he said, bowing to Frodo. 'Come now with your
friends and join our company! You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. You may
be weary before we halt.'
'Why? Where are you going?' asked Frodo.
'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some miles, but you shall
have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your journey tomorrow.'
They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint lights: for Elves (even
more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to
feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and

saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his
face half of fear and half of astonished joy.
The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and as the
lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the
rising slopes at either hand. At last the Elves turned aside from the path. A green ride lay almost
unseen through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away back up the
wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the rivervalley. Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of
grass, grey under the night. On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell
steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the slope, were below their feet.
Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the
village of Woodhall.
The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they seemed to take no further
notice of the hobbits. Frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and
drowsiness stole over them. The night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out. Pippin fell
asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.
Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly above the mists red
Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away
like a veil, and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky,
Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song. Suddenly under the trees a fire
sprang up with a red light.
'Come!' the Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come! Now is the time for speech and merriment!'
Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. 'There is a fire in the hall, and food for hungry
guests,' said an Elf standing before him.
At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the green floor ran on into the
wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like
pillars down each side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars
torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat round the fire upon the
grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink;
others brought food on heaped plates and dishes.
'This is poor fare,' they said to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our
halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat you better.'
'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo.
Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind was filled with the light
upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking
dream. But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one
who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens; he
drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer
afternoon.
Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or thought that
night, though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever
got was to say: 'Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But it was
the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.'
Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words
spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those
that served him and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing:
'Here is a jewel among hobbits!'
After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the
trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave

his master. When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he
nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.
They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings
in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering
darkness, the wars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the question that was
nearest to his heart:
'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?'
Gildor smiled. 'Yes,' he answered. 'Twice. He said farewell to us on this very spot. But I saw
him once again, far from here.' He would say no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.
'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said Gildor. 'But I already
know a little, and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind your questions. You are
leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you
intend, or that you will ever return. Is not that so?'
'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful
Sam.' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring gently.
'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,' said Gildor.
'The Enemy?' said Frodo. 'Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?'
'I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,' answered Gildor; 'but I perceive that
he is – strange indeed though that seems to me. And I warn you that peril is now both before you
and behind you, and upon either side.'
'You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy. What _are_ the Black
Riders?'
'Has Gandalf told you nothing?'
'Nothing about such creatures.'
'Then I think it is not for me to say more – lest terror should keep you from your journey. For it
seems to me that you have set out only just in time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make
haste, and neither stay nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.'
'I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings,'
exclaimed Frodo. 'I knew that danger lay ahead, of course; but I did not expect to meet it in our
own Shire. Can't a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace?'
'But it is not your own Shire,' said Gildor. 'Others dwelt here before hobbits were; and others
will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence
yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out.'
'I know – and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I do now? My plan was to
leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before
ever I get to Buckland.'
'I think you should still follow that plan,' said Gildor. 'I do not think the Road will prove too
hard for your courage. But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the
reason for your flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you.
These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before you leave the Shire?'
'I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have been expecting Gandalf for
many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never
appeared. Now I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait for him?'
Gildor was silent for a moment. 'I do not like this news,' he said at last. 'That Gandalf should be
late, does not bode well. But it is said: _Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle
and quick to anger._ The choice is yours: to go or wait.'
'And it is also said,' answered Frodo: 'Go _not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no
and yes.'_
'Is it indeed?' laughed Gildor. 'Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous
gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not

told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand
advice, I will for friendship's sake give it. I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if
Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone. Take such
friends as are trusty and willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly.
The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little concerned with the
ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or
purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I
fear to say too much.'
'I am deeply grateful,' said Frodo; 'but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders
are. If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the
danger that pursues me.'
'Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?' answered Gildor. 'Flee them!
Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all
is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May
Elbereth protect you!'
'But where shall I find courage?' asked Frodo. 'That is what I chiefly need.'
'Courage is found in unlikely places,' said Gildor. 'Be of good hope! Sleep now! In the morning
we shall have gone; but we will send our messages through the lands. The Wandering Companies
shall know of your journey, and those that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you
Elf-friend; and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such delight in
strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips of other wanderers in the
world.'
Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. 'I will sleep now,' he said;
and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into
a dreamless slumber.
_Chapter 4_
A Short Cut to Mushrooms
In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with
branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and
strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon
the tree. He jumped up and went out.
Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was standing studying the sky
and weather. There was no sign of the Elves.
'They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,' said Pippin. 'Come and have your breakfast. The
bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.'
Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. 'What is the plan for today?' asked Pippin.
'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the
food.
'Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?' asked Pippin cheerfully. Under the
morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him.
'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking the reminder. 'But I hope to get across the river without
their seeing us.'
'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?'
'Not much – only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask about the sniffing?'
'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full.
'You should have. I am sure it is very important.'

'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,' said Frodo sharply. 'And now
leave me in peace for a bit! I don't want to answer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to
think!'
'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the edge of the green.
From Frodo's mind the bright morning – treacherously bright, he thought – had not banished the
fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He
was running on the green turf and singing.
'No! I could not!' he said to himself. 'It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the
Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile,
where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is quite another – even if they are willing to come.
The inheritance is mine alone. I don't think I ought even to take Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee,
and discovered that Sam was watching him.
'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can – in fact I have
made up my mind now not even to wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.'
'Very good, sir!'
'You still mean to come with me?'
'I do.'
'It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most likely neither of us will
come back.'
'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam. _'Don't you leave him!_ they
said to me. _Leave him!_ I said. _I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon,
and if any of those Black Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with,_ I said.
They laughed.'
'Who are _they,_ and what are you talking about?'
'The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know you were going away, so
I didn't see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!'
'They are,' said Frodo. 'Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?'
'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,' answered Sam slowly. 'It don't seem
to matter what I think about them. They are quite different from what I expected – so old and
young, and so gay and sad, as it were.'
Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change
that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he
thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was
unusually thoughtful.
'Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now – now that your wish to see them has come true
already?' he asked.
'Yes, sir. I don't know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a
kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn
back. It isn't to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want – I don't rightly know what I
want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it
through, sir, if you understand me.'
'I don't altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We
will go together.'
Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land ahead, and
called to Pippin.
'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off at once. We slept late; and
there are a good many miles to go.'
_'You_ slept late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we are only waiting for you
to finish eating and thinking.'

'I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible.
I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across
country from here.'
'Then you are going to fly,' said Pippin. 'You won't cut straight on foot anywhere in this
country.'
'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered Frodo. 'The Ferry is east from Woodhall;
but the hard road curves away to the left -you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes
round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But
that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry
from where we stand.'
_'Short cuts make long delays,'_ argued Pippin. 'The country is rough round here, and there are
bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish -I know the land in these parts. And if you are
worrying about Black Riders, I can't see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood
or a field.'
'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,' answered Frodo. 'And if you are supposed
to be on the road, there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.'
'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow you into every bog and ditch. But it is hard! I had counted
on passing the _Golden Perch_ at Stock before sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used
to be: it is a long time since I tasted it.'
'That settles it!' said Frodo. 'Short cuts make delays, but inns make longer ones. At all costs we
must keep you away from the _Golden Perch_. We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do
you say, Sam?'
'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret
for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).
'Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!' said Pippin.
It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up
from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and
plunged into the thick trees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left,
and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills, until they
reached the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open,
except for a few ditches and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.
He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared. There were no
paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom
of the bank, they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep
slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen.
They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and
muddy. They halted, wondering what to do. 'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly.
Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the
green bank from which they had climbed down.
'Look!' he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on the edge high above them
they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside it stooped a black figure.
They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and plunged quickly into the
thick bushes beside the stream. 'Whew!' he said to Pippin. 'We were both right! The short cut has
gone crooked already; but we got under cover only just in time. You've got sharp ears, Sam: can
you hear anything coming?'
They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but there was no sound of pursuit.
'I don't fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank,' said Sam. 'But I guess he knows we
came down it. We had better be going on.'
Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the bushes and brambles were
reluctant to let them through. They were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was

still and stuffy. When they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired
and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going.
The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower,
wandering off towards the Marish and the River.
'Why, this is the Stock-brook!' said Pippin. 'If we are going to try and get back on to our course,
we must cross at once and bear right.'
They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown and treeless, on the
further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here
and there an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but
the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of
wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died away and the rain
came streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through
thick drifts of old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not talk, but
kept glancing back, and from side to side.
After half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope we have not turned too much towards the south, and are
not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad belt -I should have said no more
than a mile at the widest – and we ought to have been through it by now.'
'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't mend matters. Let us keep
on as we are going! I am not sure that I want to come out into the open yet.'
They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds
again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They
halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they found that the Elves had
filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of
many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their
fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them.
Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and
they began to hum, and then to sing softly:
Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go
To heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow,
And many miles be still to go,
But under a tall tree I will lie,
And let the clouds go sailing by.
_Ho! Ho! Ho!_ they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet.
A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. It rose and
fell, and ended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was
answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to the blood. There was then a
silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves.
'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak lightly, but quavering a
little. 'If it was a bird, it was one that I never heard in the Shire before.'
'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or a signal – there were words in that cry,
though I could not catch them. But no hobbit has such a voice.'
No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no one spoke of them. They
were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but sooner or later they had got to get across the open
country to the Ferry, and it was best to go sooner and in daylight. In a few moments they had
shouldered their packs again and were off.

Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched before them. They now
saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the
low hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from
the edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they could.
At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back behind them stood the high
place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman
on the ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the breaking
clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left
them, though they still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon
they came into well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for
drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Their spirits
rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like
phantoms of the woods now left far behind.
They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate. Beyond it a rutted
lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped.
'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot's land.
That's his farm away there in the trees.'
'One trouble after another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared
the lane was the slot leading to a dragon's den. The others looked at him in surprise.
'What's wrong with old Maggot?' asked Pippin. 'He's a good friend to all the Brandy bucks. Of
course he's a terror to trespassers, and keeps ferocious dogs – but after all, folk down here are near
the border and have to be more on their guard.'
'I know,' said Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with a shamefaced laugh, 'I am terrified of him
and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for years and years. He caught me several times trespassing
after mushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat me, and then
took me and showed me to his dogs. "See, lads," he said, "next time this young varmint sets foot on
my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!" They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never
got over the fright – though I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have
touched me.'
Pippin laughed. 'Well, it's time you made it up. Especially if you are coming back to live in
Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow – if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let's get into the
lane and then we shan't be trespassing. If we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry's,
and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.'
They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farm-buildings
peeping out among the trees ahead. The Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the
inhabitants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a
high wall all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane.
Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, and a loud voice was
heard shouting: 'Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!'
Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three
huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They
took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed
at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in
front of Frodo, bristling and growling.
Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face. 'Hallo!
Hallo! And who may you be, and what may you be wanting?' he asked.
'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!' said Pippin.
The farmer looked at him closely. 'Well, if it isn't Master Pippin – Mr. Peregrin Took, I should
say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. 'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's
lucky for you that I know you. I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some

funny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times. Too
near the River,' he said, shaking his head. 'But this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set
eyes on. He won't cross my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.'
'What fellow do you mean?' asked Pippin.
'Then you haven't seen him?' said the farmer. 'He went up the lane towards the causeway not a
long while back. He was a funny customer and asking funny questions. But perhaps you'll come
along inside, and we'll pass the news more comfortable. I've a drop of good ale on tap, if you and
your friends are willing, Mr. Took.'
It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do it in his own time and
fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. 'What about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously.
The farmer laughed. 'They won't harm you – not unless I tell 'em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!' he
cried. 'Heel, Wolf!' To the relief of Frodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.
Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he said. 'You may not
remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the name Baggins the farmer started, and
gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had
been aroused, and that the dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the
arm.
'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?' he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is it? Come inside! We must
have a talk.'
They went into the farmer's kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out
beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more
than compensated for missing the _Golden Perch._ Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a
natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be
quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however long ago.
After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than
usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn.
'Now, Mr. Peregrin,' he said, 'where might you be coming from, and where might you be going
to? Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.'
'Well, no,' answered Pippin. 'To tell you the truth, since you have guessed it, we got into the lane
from the other end: we had come over your fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way
in the woods, back near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the Ferry.'
'If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,' said the farmer. 'But I wasn't
worrying about that. You have leave to walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And
you, Mr. Baggins – though I daresay you still like mushrooms.' He laughed. 'Ah yes, I recognized
the name. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals of
Buckland. But it wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had just heard the name Baggins before you
turned up. What do you think that funny customer asked me?'
They waited anxiously for him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued, approaching his point with
slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and
right up to my door. All black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not
want to be known. "Now what in the Shire can he want?" I thought to myself. We don't see many of
the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black fellow.
' "Good-day to you!" I says, going out to him. "This lane don't lead anywhere, and wherever you
may be going, your quickest way will be back to the road." I didn't like the looks of him; and when
Grip came out, he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail and
bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.
' "I come from yonder," he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back west, over _my_ fields, if you
please. "Have you seen _Baggins?"_ he asked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could
not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did
not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.

' "Be off!" I said. "There are no Bagginses here. You're in the wrong part of the Shire. You had
better go back west to Hobbiton – but you can go by road this time."
' "Baggins has left," he answered in a whisper. "He is coming. He is not far away. I wish to find
him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come back with gold."
' "No you won't," I said. "You'll go back where you belong, double quick. I give you one minute
before I call all my dogs."
'He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. Then he spurred his great
horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off,
and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do you
think of that?'
Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was how on earth would they
reach the Ferry. 'I don't know what to think,' he said at last.
'Then I'll tell you what to think,' said Maggot. 'You should never have gone mixing yourself up
with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up there.' Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eye. 'But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had left the
Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you were going to find trouble. Mark
my words, this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some
strange fashion in foreign parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become
of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?'
Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting.
'Well, Mr. Frodo,' Maggot went on, 'I'm glad that you've had the sense to come back to
Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don't get mixed up with these outlandish folk. You'll have
friends in these parts. If any of these black fellows come after you again, I'll deal with them. I'll say
you're dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be true enough; for as like
as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.'
'Maybe you're right,' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring at the fire.
Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. 'Well, I see you have ideas of your own,' he said. 'It is as
plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe
my news was no great news to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a
mind to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking it
won't be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?'
'I was thinking so,' said Frodo. 'But we have got to try and get there; and it won't be done by
sitting and thinking. So I am afraid we must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your
kindness! I've been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you
may laugh to hear it. It's a pity: for I've missed a good friend. And now I'm sorry to leave so soon.
But I'll come back, perhaps, one day – if I get a chance.'
'You'll be welcome when you come,' said Maggot. 'But now I've a notion. It's near sundown
already, and we are going to have our supper; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you
and Mr. Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!'
'And so should we!' said Frodo. 'But we must be going at once, I'm afraid. Even now it will be
dark before we can reach the Ferry.'
'Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll gel out a small waggon, and
I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of
another sort.'
Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was
already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. Two of Maggot's sons and his three
daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was lit with
candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled in and out. One or two other hobbits
belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer

in plenty, and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare.
The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones.
When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon
ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. They threw their packs on board and
climbed in. The farmer sat in the driving-seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood
in the light of the open door.
'You be careful of yourself. Maggot!' she called. 'Don't go arguing with any foreigners, and
come straight back!'
'I will!' said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath of wind stirring; the night
was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. They went without lights and took it slowly. After a
mile or two the lane came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to the
high-banked causeway.
Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but nothing could be seen
in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the still air. Thin strands of river-mist were hanging
above the dikes, and crawling over the fields.
'It's going to be thick,' said Maggot; 'but I'll not light my lantern till I turn for home. We'll hear
anything on the road long before we meet it tonight.'
It was five miles or more from Maggot's lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up,
but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow _clop_ of the
ponies' hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding
towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog.
They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by two tall white posts that
suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer Maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a
halt. They were just beginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been
dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them.
Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies' heads, and peering forward into the gloom.
_Clip-clop, clip-clop_ came the approaching rider. The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still,
foggy air.
'You'd better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam anxiously. 'You get down in the waggon and
cover up with blankets, and we'll send this rider to the rightabouts!' He climbed out and went to the
farmer's side. Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon.
_Clop-clop, clop-clop._ The rider was nearly on them.
'Hallo there!' called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought they
could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard or two ahead. 'Now then!' said the
farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and striding forward. 'Don't you come a step nearer! What do you
want, and where are you going?'
'I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?' said a muffled voice – but the voice was the voice of
Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and its light fell on the astonished face of the
farmer.
'Mr. Merry!' he cried.
'Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?' said Merry coming forward. As he came out of the
mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was
riding a pony, and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog.
Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. 'So there you are at last!' said Merry. 'I was
beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today, and I was just going back to supper. When it
grew foggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I'm
blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duckpond?'

'No, I caught 'em trespassing,' said the farmer, 'and nearly set my dogs on 'em; but they'll tell
you all the story, I've no doubt. Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I'd best
be turning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.'
He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. 'Well, good night to you all,' he said. 'It's been
a queer day, and no mistake. But all's well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until
we reach our own doors. I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I do.' He lit his lanterns, and got
up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. 'I was nearly forgetting,' he said. 'Mrs.
Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.' He handed it down and moved off,
followed by a chorus of thanks and good-nights.
They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night.
Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the covered basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising.
_Chapter 5_
A Conspiracy Unmasked
'Now we had better get home ourselves,' said Merry. There's something funny about all this, I
see; but it must wait till we get in.'
They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and edged with large whitewashed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad
wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the
water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat
fields were now above the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a few curling
wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side.
Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others followed. Merry then pushed
slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side
the bank was steep, and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were
twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds of mist,
shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancient
home of the Brandybucks.
Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the oldest in the Marish or
indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards.
He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to
become master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew and grew, and
after his days continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill, and had
three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their
numerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the origin
of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest, a sort of colony from
the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.
The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the authority of the Master of
the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers
between Stock and Rushey. But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as
peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very different from
the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats, and some of
them could swim.
Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side they had built a hedge: the
High Hay. It had been planted many generations ago, and was now thick and tail, for it was
constantly tended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the
river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over
twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection. The Forest drew

close to the hedge in many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also
was not usual in the Shire.
The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam was the
only member of the party who had not been over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the
slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He
scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living
quietly at Bag End.
The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the
pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in
a hoarse whisper:
'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?'
On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark
black bundle left behind. But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if
searching the ground. It then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.
'What in the Shire is that?' exclaimed Merry.
'Something that is following us,' said Frodo. 'But don't ask any more now! Let's get away at
once!' They hurried up the path to the top of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was
shrouded in mist, and nothing could be seen.
'Thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west-bank!' said Frodo. 'Can horses cross the
river?'
'They can go twenty miles north to Brandywine Bridge – or they might swim,' answered Merry.
'Though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?'
I'll tell you later. Let's get indoors and then we can talk.'
'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are
coming. We'll see about supper and things.'
'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo; 'but we could do with another.'
'You shall have it! Give me that basket!' said Merry, and rode ahead into the darkness.
It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo's new house at Crickhollow. They passed
Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of
Buckland that ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane
opening on their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the
country.
At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be seen of the house in the
dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low
trees inside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of
the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being
noticed. It had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or
members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It
was an old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long and
low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door.
As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows were dark and
shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out.
They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with
doors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house.
'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We have done our best in a
short time to make it look like home. After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load
yesterday.'
Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite things – or Bilbo's things
(they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling) – were arranged as nearly as possible as
they had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself

wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair to have
put his friends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to
them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very
night, before they all went to bed.
'It's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'I hardly feel that I have moved at all.'
The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the floor. Merry led them down the
passage and threw open a door at the far end. Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.
'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!'
'Which order shall we go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest first, or quickest first? You'll be last either way,
Master Peregrin.'
'Trust me to arrange things better than that!' said Merry. 'We can't begin life at Crickhollow with
a quarrel over baths. In that room there are _three_ tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There
are also towels, mats and soap. Get inside, and be quick!'
Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, and busied themselves
with the final preparations for a late supper. Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom
mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up
above the others in one of Bilbo's favourite bath-songs.
Sing hey! for the bath at close of day
that washes the weary mud away!
A loon is he that will not sing:
O! Water Hot is a noble thing!
O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,
and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;
but better than rain or rippling streams
is Water Hot that smokes and steams.
O! Water cold we may pour at need
down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;
but better is Beer, if drink we lack,
and Water Hot poured down the back.
O! Water is fair that leaps on high
in a fountain white beneath the sky;
but never did fountain sound so sweet
as splashing Hot Water with my feet!
There was a terrific splash, and a shout of _Whoa!_ from Frodo. It appeared that a lot of Pippin's
bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high.
Merry went to the door: 'What about supper and beer in the throat?' he called. Frodo came out
drying his hair.
'There's so much water in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to finish,' he said.
'Lawks!' said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. 'You ought to mop all that up
before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,' he said. 'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.'
They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'I suppose you three won't want
mushrooms again?' said Fredegar without much hope.
'Yes we shall!' cried Pippin.

'They're mine!' said Frodo. 'Given to _me_ by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among farmers' wives.
Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.'
Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People. A
fact which partly explains young Frodo's long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and
the wrath of the injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to hobbit
standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they had finished even Fatty
Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back the table, and drew chairs round the fire.
'We'll clear up later,' said Merry. 'Now tell me all about it! I guess that you have been having
adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I want a full account; and most of all I want to
know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost
as if he was _scared,_ if that is possible.'
'We have all been scared,' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not
speak. 'You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.'
'And what are they?'
'Black figures riding on black horses,' answered Pippin. 'If Frodo won't talk, I will tell you the
whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when
they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.
'I should think you were making it all up,' said Merry, 'if I had not seen that black shape on the
landing-stage – and heard the queer sound in Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?'
'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin. 'But the time has come for him to open out. So
far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot's guess that it has something to
do with old Bilbo's treasure.'
'That was only a guess,' said Frodo hastily. 'Maggot does not _know_anything.'
'Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,' said Merry. 'A lot goes on behind his round face that does not
come out in his talk. I've heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the
reputation of knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you
think his guess good or bad.'
'I _think,'_ answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as far as it goes. There _is a_
connexion with Bilbo's old adventures, and the Riders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say
_searching,_ for him or for me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I
am not safe here or anywhere else.' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he was afraid
they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in silence, and exchanged meaning
glances among themselves.
'It's coming out in a minute,' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded.
'Well!' said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as if he had made a decision. 'I
can't keep it dark any longer. I have got something to tell you all. But I don't know quite how to
begin.'
'I think I could help you,' said Merry quietly, 'by telling you some of it myself.'
'What do you mean?' said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. 'Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are
miserable, because you don't know how to say good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course.
But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to
go at once. And you don't want to. We are very sorry for you.'
Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so comical that they laughed.
'Dear old Frodo!' said Pippin. 'Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have
not been nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and
saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard you muttering:
"Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder", and things like that. And pretending that
you had come to the end of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those
Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.'

'Good heavens!' said Frodo. 'I thought I had been both careful and clever. I don't know what
Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my departure then?'
'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for long, of course; but at
present it is, I think, only known to us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know
you well, and are often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, too.
To tell you the truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever since he left. I thought you would
go after him sooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very
anxious. We have been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your
own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of
planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so easily!'
'But I must go,' said Frodo. 'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is wretched for us all, but it is no
use your trying to keep me. Since you have guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder
me!'
'You do not understand!' said Pippin. 'You must go – and therefore we must, too. Merry and I
are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon's throat to save
you, if he did not trip over his own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your
dangerous adventure.'
'My dear and most beloved hobbits!' said Frodo deeply moved. 'But I could not allow it. I
decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasurehunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.'
'Of course we understand,' said Merry firmly. 'That is why we have decided to come. We know
the Ring is no laughing-matter; but we are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy.'
'The Ring!' said Frodo, now completely amazed.
'Yes, the Ring,' said Merry. 'My dear old hobbit, you don't allow for the inquisitiveness of
friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring for years – before Bilbo went away, in fact;
but since he obviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our
conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was
also more careful – but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I first found out, I will
tell you.'
'Go on!' said Frodo faintly.
'It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might expect. One day, a year
before the Party, I happened to be walking along the road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the
distance the S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he
vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I
got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping through into the road, after
the S.-B.s had passed, and was looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a
glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.
'After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But you must admit that it was
very intriguing, and I was only in my teens. I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo,
that has ever seen the old fellow's secret book.'
'You have read his book!' cried Frodo. 'Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?'
'Not too safe, I should say,' said Merry. 'But I have only had one rapid glance, and that was
difficult to get. He never left the book about. I wonder what became of it. I should like another
look. Have you got it, Frodo?'
'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.'
'Well, as I was saying,' Merry proceeded, 'I kept my knowledge to myself, till this Spring when
things got serious. Then we formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant
business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is
worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.'

'Where is he?' said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come
out of a cupboard.
'Step forward, Sam!' said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears. 'Here's our
collector of information! And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After
which, I may say, he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.'
'Sam!' cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite unable to decide
whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely foolish.
'Yes, sir!' said Sam. 'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to
Mr. Gandalf for that matter. _He_ has some sense, mind you; and when you said _go alone,_ he
said _no! lake someone as you can trust.'_
'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo. Sam looked at him unhappily. 'It all
depends on what you want,' put in Merry. 'You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin –
to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours – closer than you keep it yourself.
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your
friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you. We know a good
deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid – but we are coming with you; or following you like
hounds.'
'And after all, sir,' added Sam, 'you did ought to take the Elves' advice. Gildor said you should
take them as was willing, and you can't deny it.'
'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. 'I don't deny it, but I'll never
believe you are sleeping again, whether you snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.
'You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!' he said, turning to the others. 'But bless you!' he laughed,
getting up and waving his arms, 'I give in. I will take Gildor's advice. If the danger were not so
dark, I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a
long time. I had dreaded this evening.'
'Good! That's settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!' they shouted; and they
danced round him. Merry and Pippin began a song, which they had apparently got ready for the
occasion.
It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and
went to the same tune:
Farewell we call to hearth and hall!
Though wind may blow and rain may fall,
We must away ere break of day
Far over wood and mountain tall.
To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell
In glades beneath the misty fell,
Through moor and waste we ride in haste,
And whither then we cannot tell.
With foes ahead, behind us dread,
Beneath the sky shall be our bed,
Until at last our toil be passed,
Our journey done, our errand sped.
We must away! We must away!
We ride before the break of day!

'Very good!' said Frodo. 'But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed –
under a roof, for tonight at any rate.'
'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before the break of day?'
'I don't know,' answered Frodo. 'I fear those Black Riders, and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in
one place long, especially in a place to which it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not
to wait. But I should very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed
when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two things. How soon could
the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good deal of
preparation.'
'The answer to the second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get off in an hour. I have
prepared practically everything. There are six ponies in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle
are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.'
'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But what about the Black Riders?
Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'
'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,' answered
Merry. 'They _could_ have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the Northgate, where the Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards
would not let them through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they
would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the
Hall – for they would not like the look of the Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them.
But, of course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the
morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It is
pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow.'
Frodo sat for a while in thought. 'I have made up my mind,' he said finally. 'I am starting
tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that.
If I go through the North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of being
secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near
the borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don't know
how many there are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is to go off
in a quite unexpected direction.'
'But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!' said Fredegar horrified. 'You can't be
thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as Black Riders.'
'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo is right. It is the only way
of getting off without being followed at once. With luck we might gel a considerable start.'
'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No one ever has luck in
there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.'
'Oh yes they do!' said Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in – occasionally when the fit takes them.
We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in
daylight, of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.'
'Well, do as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I
know about: the stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on
the journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have
done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'
Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay
outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he
had never been over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the
conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible
the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old
clothes of Frodo's to help him in playing the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might
prove.

'Excellent!' said Frodo, when he understood the plan. 'We could not have left any message
behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don't know whether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I
should not have dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if
Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that
decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow.'
'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our job than Fatty's – waiting
here till Black Riders come.'
'You wait till you are well inside the Forest,' said Fredegar. 'You'll wish you were back here with
me before this time tomorrow.'
'It's no good arguing about it any more,' said Merry. 'We have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches to the packing, before we get to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.'
When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He. was
glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed
to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots
there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out
sooner or later.
Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the
leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound
he had never heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he
was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange
salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone on a high
ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up
the ridge towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of thunder.
_Chapter 6_
The Old Forest
Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing there with a candle in
one hand, and banging on the door with the other. 'All right! What is it?' said Frodo, still shaken
and bewildered.
'What is it!' cried Merry. 'It is time to get up. It is half past four and very foggy. Come on! Sam
is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch
the one that is to be the baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and see
us off.'
Soon after six o'clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty Bolger was still yawning. They
stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a
path that went through a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. The leaves of
trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey with cold dew. Everything
was still, and far-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a
door of a distant house.
In their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits, not speedy,
but good for a long day's work. They mounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which
seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for about
an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was tall and
netted over with silver cobwebs. 'How are you going to get through this?' asked Fredegar. 'Follow
me!' said Merry, 'and you will see.' He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they came to a
point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A cutting had been made, at some
distance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the

sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep
under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.
Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he said. 'I wish you were not going into the Forest.
I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out. But good luck to you – today and
every day!'
'If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky,' said Frodo. 'Tell
Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'
'Good-bye!' they cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the
tunnel.
It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars. Merry got
down and unlocked the gate, and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut
with a clang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.
'There!' said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and on the edge of the Old
Forest.'
'Are the stories about it true?' asked Pippin.
'I don't know what stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the old bogey-stories Fatty's
nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no. At any
rate I don't believe them. But the Forest _is_ queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more
aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire. And the trees do not like
strangers. They watch you. They are usually content merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts,
and don't do much. Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or
grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, or so I am told. I have
only once or twice been in here after dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were
whispering to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and the
branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees do actually move, and can
surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and
planted themselves right by it, and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of
trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the
Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly. There is still a wide
bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made.'
'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?' asked Pippin.
'There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the far side,' said Merry, 'or at
least I have heard so; but I have never seen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever
one comes inside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a
queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning of quite a
broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east and a little
north. That is the path I am going to try and find.'
The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. On the far side was a faint
path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it
vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of
the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. Looking ahead they could
see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or
slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and
slimy, shaggy growths.
Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. 'You had better lead on and find that path,' Frodo said to
him. 'Don't let us lose one another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!'
They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many
writhing and interlacing roots. There was no undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as
they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no sound,
except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no

whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they
were being watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily
grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders, as if
they expected a sudden blow.
There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way. Pippin
suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout. 'Oi! Oi!' he
cried. 'I am not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!'
The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain. There was no echo or
answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before.
'I should not shout, if I were you,' said Merry. It does more harm than good.'
Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been right to
make the others come into this abominable wood. Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed
already uncertain which way to go. Pippin noticed it. 'It has not taken you long to lose us,' he said.
But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead.
'Well, well!' he said. 'These trees _do_ shift. There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us (or I hope
so), but the path to it seems to have moved away!'
The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of the trees and found
themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above them, blue and clear to their surprise, for
down under the Forest-roof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the
mist. The sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing, though its light
was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade,
enclosing it with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants:
stalky and faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant
nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close
Forest.
The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky. At
the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They
could see it running on into the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were
still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed to them
that the Forest had relented, and was going to let them pass unhindered after all.
But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side,
and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the
wood pressing on them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies' hoofs, rustling on dead leaves
and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song
to encourage them, but his voice sank to a murmur.
O! Wanderers in the shadowed land
despair not! For though dark they stand,
all woods there be must end at last,
and see the open sun go past:
the setting sun, the rising sun,
the day's end, or the day begun.
For east or west all woods must fail ...
_Fail -_ even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air seemed heavy and the
making of words wearisome. Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree
with a crash into the path. The trees seemed to close in before them.

'They do not like all that about ending and failing,' said Merry. 'I should not sing any more at
present. Wait till we do get to the edge, and then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!'
He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show it. The others did not
answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo's heart, and he
regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the
trees. He was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still possible), when
things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. The dark
trees drew aside, and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but
some distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out of the encircling
wood. The path seemed to be making directly for it.
They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above
the roof of the Forest. The path dipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at last
to the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood all
round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown.
The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they reached the top. There they
stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to
any great distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in
hollows of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest, the
fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke.
'That,' said Merry, pointing with his hand, 'that is the line of the Withywindle. It comes down
out of the Downs and flows south-west through the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine
below Haysend. We don't want to go _that_ way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest
part of the whole wood – the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.'
The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they could see little but mists over
the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view.
The sun on the hill-lop was now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o'clock; but the
autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions. In the west they could not
make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where
they looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the great East Road,
for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizon was veiled.
On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the slopes of the hill were continued
far down under the trees, like island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep
waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, while they ate their
mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green
lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it
was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood's borders, though they did not mean to go that
way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the
Forest itself.
At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had brought them to the hill
reappeared on the northward side; but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it
was bending steadily to the right. Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must
actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley: not at all the direction they wished lo take.
After some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward; for although
they had not been able to see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be
many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed lo be drier and more
open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and
ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood.
At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got
a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But
after a time the trees began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be

thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly, like the ruts
of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles.
These lay usually right across their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down
and out again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they climbed down
they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth, which somehow would not
yield to the left, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance
along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they clambered out,
the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find
a way, and they were forced to the right and downwards.
After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though they knew well enough
that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They were being headed off, and were simply
following a course chosen for them – eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not
out of it.
The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider
and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible to
climb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage
behind. All they could do was to follow the fold – downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places
boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they found themselves following a brook that
trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook
growing strong and noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully
over-arched by trees high above them.
After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite suddenly out of the
gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them. Coming to the opening they found
that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet
was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as
steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between. In
the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows,
arched over with willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded
willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the branches; for there was a
warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willowboughs were creaking.
'Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!' said Merry. 'We have come almost in
the opposite direction to which we intended. This is the River Withywindle! I will go on and
explore.'
He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. After a while he
reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the river; in
some places firm turf went down to the water's edge. 'What's more,' he said, 'there seems to be
something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river. If we turn left and follow it, we
shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest eventually.'
'I dare say!' said Pippin. 'That is, if the track goes on so far, and does not simply lead us into a
bog and leave us there. Who made the track, do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our
benefit. I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe all
the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go?'
'No,' said Merry, 'I haven't. I don't know in the least how far down the Withywindle we are, or
who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along it. But there is no other way out
that I can see or think of.'
There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to the path that he had
discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall, in places far above their heads;
but once found, the path was easy to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder
ground among the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed over other rills, running down gullies

into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or
bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.
The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their
ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin
shade; great grey branches reached across the path. Each step forward became more reluctant than
the last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, and falling softly out
of the air upon their heads and eyes.
Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him Pippin fell forward on to his
knees. Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard Merry saying. 'Can't go another step without rest. Must
have nap. It's cool under the willows. Less flies!'
Frodo did not like the sound of this. 'Come on!' he cried. 'We can't have a nap yet. We must get
clear of the Forest first.' But the others were too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning
and blinking stupidly.
Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. There now seemed
hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing,
a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy
eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it looked, its
sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands, its knotted and
twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves
fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the
grass.
Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willowtrunk. Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked.
They looked up at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They
shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, saying something
about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the
great grey willow.
Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him; then with an effort he
struggled to his feel again. He felt a compelling desire for cool water. 'Wait for me, Sam,' he
stammered. 'Must bathe feet a minute.'
Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, where great winding
roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink. He straddled one of
these, and paddled his hot feel in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with
his back against the tree.
Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was worried. The afternoon
was getting late, and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny. 'There's more behind this than sun
and warm air,' he muttered to himself. 'I don't like this great big tree. I don't trust it. Hark at it
singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!'
He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies. He found
that two had wandered on a good way along the path; and he had just caught them and brought
them back towards the others, when he heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very
clear. One was the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise like the
snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast.
He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the edge, and a great tree-root
seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was not struggling. Sam gripped him by the
jacket, and dragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank.
Almost at once he woke, and coughed and spluttered.
'Do you know, Sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree _threw_ me in! I felt it. The big root just
twisted round and tipped me in!'

'You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit in such a place, if you feel
sleepy.'
'What about the others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder what sort of dreams they are having.'
They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood the click that he had
heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not
a chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay
outside, but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped like a pair of
pincers.
Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain. They then struggled
frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Merry. It was quite useless.
'What a foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo wildly. 'Why did we ever come into this dreadful
Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!' He kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless
of his own feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the
leaves rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter.
'I suppose we haven't got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked Sam.
'I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That wouldn't be much use.'
'Wait a minute!' cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. 'We might do something
with fire!'
'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside.'
'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said Sam fiercely. 'If it don't let them
go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw it.' He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two
tinder-boxes and a hatchet.
Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of broken twigs
and chopped sticks. These they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the
prisoners. As soon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of
flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored
rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed
to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and
from far inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.
'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you don't. He says so!'
'Who? What?' shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of the tree.
'Put it out! Put it out!' begged Merry. The branches of the willow began to sway violently. There
was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round
about, as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river-valley and set up
ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the
sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path
crying _help! help! help!_It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill
voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves, as
soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost and witless.
Suddenly he slopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind
him, away down the path further back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there
could be no doubt: someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and
happily, but it was singing nonsense:
Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!
Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!
Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!

Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both stood still. Suddenly
out of a long string of nonsense-words (or so they seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and
burst into this song:
Hey! Come merry dot! derry dol! My darling!
Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.
Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,
Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,
There my pretty lady is. River-woman's daughter,
Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.
Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing
Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?
Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o,
Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!
Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!
Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.
Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing.
Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?
Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again on
stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the
path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather
stuck in the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At
any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People,
though he made noise enough for one, slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs,
and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat and a
long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple, but creased
into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile
of white water-lilies.
'Help!' cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out.
'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!' cried the old man, holding up one hand, and they stopped short, as
if they had been struck stiff. 'Now, my little fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a
bellows? What's the matter here then? Do you know who I am? I'm Tom Bombadil. Tell me what's
your trouble! Tom's in a hurry now. Don't you crush my lilies!'
'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly.
'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam.
'What?' shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. 'Old Man Willow? Naught worse than
that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! I'll freeze his
marrow cold, if he don't behave himself. I'll sing his roots off. I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and
branch away. Old Man Willow!' Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the tree.
There he saw Merry's feet still sticking out – the rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom
put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the words,
but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang away, and breaking off a
hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it. 'You let them out again, Old Man Willow!' he
said. 'What be you a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go
to sleep! Bombadil is talking!' He then seized Merry's feet and drew him out of the suddenly
widening crack.

There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it Pippin sprang, as if he had
been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree
from root to tip, and complete silence fell.
'Thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other.
Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. 'Well, my little fellows!' said he, stooping so that he peered
into their faces. 'You shall come home with me! The table is all laden with yellow cream,
honeycomb, and white bread and butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around
the supper table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up his lilies,
and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward,
still singing loudly and nonsensically.
Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him as fast as they could. But
that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in front of them, and the noise of his singing got
fainter and further away. Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo!
Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!
Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle.
Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.
When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,
Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.
Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!
Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.
Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you!
After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees
behind them. They thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and
the windows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across
them; trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. White mists began to
rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders. Out
of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.
It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their legs seemed leaden.
Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either side of them; and if they looked up
to the pale sky, they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the
twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood. They began to
feel that all this country was unreal, and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that
led to no awakening.
Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed that the ground was gently
rising. The water began to murmur. In the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where
the river flowed over a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left
behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them.
The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily down to meet them, glinting here and there in
the light of the stars, which were already shining in the sky.
The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown or shaven. The eaves of
the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. The path was now plain before them, welltended and bordered with stone. It wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the
pale starry night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the twinkling lights
of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillside of turf, towards
the light. Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There
was Tom Bombadil's house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep shoulder of the

land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrow-downs stalked away into the
eastern night.
They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their weariness and all their fears had
fallen from them. _Hey! Come merry dol!_ rolled out the song to greet them.
Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!
Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.
Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!
Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the song of a glad water
flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills, came falling like silver to meet
them:
Now let the song begin! Let us sing together
Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,
Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,
Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,
Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:
Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!
And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden light was all about them.
_Chapter 7_
In the House of Tom Bombadil
The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood still, blinking. They were in a
long low room, filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table
of dark polished wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.
In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a woman. Her long yellow hair
rippled down her shoulders; her gown was green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads
of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of
forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware, white water-lilies
were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.
'Enter, good guests!' she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had
heard singing. They came a few timid steps further into the room, and began to bow low, feeling
strangely surprised and awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of
water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. But before they could
say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as
she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.
'Come dear folk!' she said, taking Frodo by the hand. 'Laugh and be merry! I am Goldberry,
daughter of the River.' Then lightly she passed them and closing the door she turned her back to it,
with her white arms spread out across it. 'Let us shut out the night!' she said. 'For you are still
afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. Fear nothing! For
tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.'
The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and smiled. 'Fair lady
Goldberry!' said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He
stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon
him was different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart;

marvellous and yet not strange. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' he said again. 'Now the joy that was hidden
in the songs we heard is made plain to me.
O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!
O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!
O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!
O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!'
Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things.
But Goldberry laughed.
'Welcome!' she said. 'I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweet-tongued. But I see you
are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting!
Sit now, and wait for the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired beasts.'
The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about the
table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet
delight. From somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they
caught, among many a _derry dol_ and a _merry dol_ and a _ring a ding dillo_ the repeated words:
Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;
Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.
'Fair lady!' said Frodo again after a while. 'Tell me, if my asking does not seem foolish, who is
Tom Bombadil?'
'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.
Frodo looked at her questioningly. 'He is, as you have seen him,' she said in answer to his look.
'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.'
'Then all this strange land belongs to him?'
'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a burden,' she added in a
low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land
belong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom walking
in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear.
Tom Bombadil is master.'
A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his thick brown hair was
crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, and going to Goldberry, took her hand.
'Here's my pretty lady!' he said, bowing to the hobbits. 'Here's my Goldberry clothed all in
silver-green with flowers in her girdle! Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and
white bread, and butter; milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for
us? Is the supper ready?'
'It is,' said Goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?'
Tom clapped his hands and cried: 'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and you had near forgotten!
Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash
your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!'
He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn. They
came to a low room with a sloping roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the
house). Its walls were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and
yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green rushes. There were four deep
mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite
wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled
with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside each
bed.

Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the table, two on each side, while
at either end sat Goldberry and the Master. It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate,
as only famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed to be
clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices. The guests became
suddenly aware that they were singing merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.
At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The guests were commanded to sit
quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide
hearth before them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of apple-wood. When
everything was set in order, all the lights in the room were put out, except one lamp and a pair of
candles at each end of the chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a
candle; and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.
'Have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! For nothing passes door
and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top. Good night!' She
passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream
falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night.
Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to muster the courage to ask
one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last
Frodo spoke:
'Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought you at that moment?'
Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'Eh, what?' said he. 'Did I hear you
calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call it.
It was no plan of mine, though I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you
were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths lead that way, down
to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he's a mighty singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape
his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' Tom nodded as if sleep
was taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice:
I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,
green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,
the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter,
to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted.
Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her,
in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;
there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.
By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,
fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.
Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!
He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:
And that proved well for you – for now I shall no longer
go down deep again along the forest-water,
not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing
Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time,
not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter
dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.
He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more question: the one he most desired
to have answered. 'Tell us, Master,' he said, 'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard
of him before.'

'No, don't!' said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. 'Not now! Not until the
morning!'
'That is right!' said the old man. 'Now is the time for resting. Some things are ill to hear when the
world's in shadow. Sleep till the morning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no
grey willow!' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a candle in either
hand he led them out of the room.
Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were of white wool. They had
hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were
asleep.
In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the young moon rising; under
its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate.
It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of
hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a
vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed
to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from
the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many wolves. Suddenly a
shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a
light flashed from the staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The
voices wailed and the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it
was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. 'Black Riders!' thought
Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he
would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still
listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some
other unremembered dream.
At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned
and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the
sound that had disturbed his dream: _tip-tap, squeak_: the noise was like branches fretting in the
wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window: _creak, creak, creak._ He wondered if there were
willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an
ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice
laughing at him again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down again
relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: 'Fear nothing! Have peace until the
morning! Heed no nightly noises!' Then he went to sleep again.
It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet sleep: water streaming down
gently, and then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It
gurgled under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. 'I shall be drowned!' he thought. It will
find its way in, and then I shall drown.' He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing
up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay
down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: 'Nothing passes doors or windows save
moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.' A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain.
He breathed deep and fell asleep again.
As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep content, if logs are contented.
They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving about the room whistling
like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped his hands, and cried: 'Hey! Come merry dol!
derry dol! My hearties!' He drew back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had
covered the windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking west.
They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking into a
kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked
with hoof-prints. Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far
beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a pale morning: in the

East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of
yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on
the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.
Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The Forest was hidden
under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or
channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows; the valley of the Withywindle.
The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand was a
flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dewdrops. There was no willow-tree to be seen.
'Good morning, merry friends!' cried Tom, opening the eastern window wide. A cool air flowed
in; it had a rainy smell. 'Sun won't show her face much today. I'm thinking. I have been walking
wide, leaping on the hilltops, since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass
underfoot, wet sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but nought wakes
hobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleep after
light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a
ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties! If you come soon you'll find breakfast on the table. If you
come late you'll get grass and rain-water!'
Needless to say – not that Tom's threat sounded very serious – the hobbits came soon, and left
the table late and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry
were there. Tom could be heard about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the
stairs, and singing here and there outside. The room looked westward over the mist-clouded valley,
and the window was open. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above. Before they had
finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly
and steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.
As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain
out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, but
it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the
tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The hobbits listened with
delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them
from departing. The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he
guessed now that they would not go further that day.
The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden
rain on the bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water.
Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk
and go bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the
house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain – and indeed when he sprang over the
threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots. These he took off and put in the chimneycorner. Then he sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.
'This is Goldberry's washing day,' he said, 'and her autumn-cleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk –
let them rest while they are able! It's a good day for long tales, for questions and for answers, so
Tom will start the talking.'
He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if speaking to himself, sometimes
looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn
to song, and he would get out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and flowers,
the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about the evil things and good things,
things friendly and things unfriendly, cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under
brambles.
As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, apart from themselves, indeed
to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home. Moving constantly in and
out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more

than enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom's words laid bare the hearts of trees and their
thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the
earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the
Old Forest without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods; and in it
there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering
times when they were lords. The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and
with malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was rotten, but his
strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran
through the woods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and
spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its
dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.
Suddenly Tom's talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream, over bubbling
waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies,
wandering at last up on to the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and
the stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks.
Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms
fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords.
There was victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the
sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and mounds covered them, and the
stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but
soon the hills were empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were
stirred in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold
fingers, and gold chains in the wind.' Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the
moonlight.
The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the Barrow-wights of the Barrow-downs
beyond the Forest had been heard. But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a
comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had
driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those
dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.
When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions
beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, into limes when the world was wider, and
the seas flowed straight to the western Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into
ancient starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and they saw that
he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it seemed as
if, under the spell of his words, the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had
been withdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was filled with the
light of white stars.
Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell.
He did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through the window
and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a
sudden fear of that silence:
'Who are you, Master?' he asked.
'Eh, what?' said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. 'Don't you know my name
yet? That's the only answer. Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are
young and I am old. Eldest, that's what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the
river and the trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the
Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here before the Kings and the graves and the
Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were
bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless – before the Dark Lord came from
Outside.'

A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes.
When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door behind, framed in light. She held a candle,
shielding its flame from the draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight
through a white shell.
'The rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running downhill, under the stars. Let us now
laugh and be glad!'
'And let us have food and drink!' cried Tom. 'Long tales are thirsty. And long listening's hungry
work, morning, noon, and evening!' With that he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a
candle from the chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced about the
table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared.
Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and Goldberry set the table; and
the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry
and odd the caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, neither
hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the table; and with great speed food
and vessels and lights were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom
bowed to his guests. 'Supper is ready,' said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was
clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes' mail. But Tom was all in
clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had green stockings.
It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of Tom's words may have
missed one meal or many, but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they
had eaten. They did not sing or even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business.
But after a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and
laughter.
After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily in the hills
and fell softly down into silence; and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider
than any they had known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like
jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the
fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions.
He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and indeed to know much
of all the history and doings of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits
themselves. It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge
largely to Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they
had imagined. 'There's earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in his bones, and
both his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it
seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.
Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself
telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf.
Tom wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.
'Show me the precious Ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own
astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to
Tom.
It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly
he put it to his eye and laughed. For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming,
of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the end of
his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange
about this. Then they gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!
Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air – and it vanished with a flash. Frodo
gave a cry – and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile.
Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler).
It was the same Ring, or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed

to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He was
perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so
perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and Tom was
telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways – then he slipped the Ring on.
Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an exclamation. Frodo
was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair,
and obviously could not see him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the
outer door.
'Hey there!' cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes. 'Hey!
Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil's not as blind as that yet. Take off
your golden ring! Your hand's more fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down
beside me! We must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the right
road, and keep your feet from wandering.'
Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came and sat down again.
Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad
morning, and setting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to start early; for weather in
that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. 'I am no weather-master,' he said; 'nor is aught
that goes on two legs.'
By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house, over the western and
lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way to strike the East Road in a day's journey,
and avoid the Barrows. He told them not to be afraid – but to mind their own business.
'Keep to the green grass. Don't you go a-meddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in
their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter!' He said this more than once;
and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he
taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next
day.
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,
By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!
Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!
When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on the shoulder with a
laugh, and taking candles led them back to their bedroom.
_Chapter 8_
Fog on the Barrow-Downs
That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of them, he could not tell which,
Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light
behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it
was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.
The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a tree-full of birds; and the sun
was already slanting down the hill and through the open window. Outside everything was green and
pale gold.
After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say farewell, as nearly heavy of
heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin
blue. The air came fresh from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and

moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep,
bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.
They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and went slanting up
towards the north end of the hill-brow under which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead
their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.
'Goldberry!' he cried. 'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have never said farewell to her,
nor seen her since the evening!' He was so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear
call came rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair was flying
loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A light like the glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced.
They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They bowed, but with a wave
of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the
morning. It was now as clear and far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the
knoll in the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West.
In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which
lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was
a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop in the lowlands and
flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land
ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth-colours, until it faded into a
featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge into the
morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a
remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and
old tales, of the high and distant mountains.
They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them
wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the
downs towards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of
the hills straight towards the Mountains.
Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. 'Speed now, fair guests!' she said.
'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps!
Make haste while the Sun shines!' And to Frodo she said: 'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry
meeting!'
But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, and followed by
his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the
valley, and the Forest were lost to view. The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside
and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they
reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender like a sunlit
flower against the sky: she was standing still watching them, and her hands were stretched out
towards them. As they looked she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished
behind the hill.
Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into
another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further hills, and down their long
limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There
was no tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy turf, silent except for
the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they
journeyed the sun mounted, and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to
have grown less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest seemed to
be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould. A shadow
now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot
and heavy.

About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, like a shallow saucer with
a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They
rode across and looked northwards. Then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come
further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and
deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end. A long valley lay
below them winding away northwards, until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders.
Beyond, there seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line. That is
a line of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark the Road. All along it for many leagues east of the
Bridge there are trees growing. Some say they were planted in the old days.'
'Splendid!' said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning,
we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place.'
But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were
higher and looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, and on
some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.
That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into the
hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at
this hour casting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding
finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless
noon; so they set their backs against the east side of the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no
power to warm it; but at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made
as good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came from 'down under
Hill'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day. Their ponies unburdened
strayed upon the grass.
Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the scent of turf, lying a little too
long, stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps,
enough to explain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably
from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone was cold, and it cast a long pale
shadow that stretched eastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming
through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east,
beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy and chill. Their ponies
were standing crowded together with their heads down.
The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. They found that they were
upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before
their eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up
to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof:
they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone.
They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart. They still
remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in
which direction it lay. In any case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the
stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as quickly as their
chilled fingers would work.
Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward
slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they went down the mist became colder and damper,
and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so
cold that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed with grey drops.
Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise and fall of the
ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far
northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were through the
gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to

strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away
beyond the Downs there might be no fog.
Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different
directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam was behind him, and after him came Pippin,
and then Merry. The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On
either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they
would be free.
'Come on! Follow me!' he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried forward. But his hope
soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and
suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the
pillars of a headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen any sign
of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning. He had passed between
them almost before he was aware: and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His
pony reared and snorted, and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the
others had not followed him. 'Sam!' he called. 'Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don't you keep
up?'
There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly: 'Sam!
Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into the mist and vanished. From some way off, or so it
seemed, he thought he heard a cry: 'Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood
under the great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the direction of the
call, and found himself going steeply uphill.
As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more frantically; but he heard
no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him. 'Frodo! Hoy!'
came the thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like _help, help!_ often repeated,
ending with a last _help!_ that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward
with all the speed he could towards the cries; but the light was now gone, and clinging night had
closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be
climbing up and up.
Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of
a ridge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet chilled. It was wholly dark.
'Where are you?' he cried out miserably.
There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold,
and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy wind. A change was coming in the weather.
The mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, and the darkness
was less near and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing
overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind began to hiss over the grass.
He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards it; and even as he
went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled. A glance
showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have
climbed from the north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there loomed
against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.
'Where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid.
'Here!' said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the ground. 'I am waiting for
you!'
'No!' said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell on the ground. Nothing
happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he looked up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a
shadow against the stars. It leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit
with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip stronger and colder
than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and he remembered no more.

When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread.
Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrowwight had taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights
about which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: flat on his
back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast.
But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round
him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along
together in the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage
hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, wailing for some
final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed,
though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He
thought he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought hardened him.
He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey.
As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all at once that the darkness
was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was growing round him. It did not at first show him
what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor
beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly
pale; and they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that
light they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their
waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by their sides, and shields were at their
feet. But across their three necks lay one long naked sword.
Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice seemed far away and
immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the
ground. Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and
again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing
against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it
hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while the song became clearer, and with dread
in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation:
Cold be hand and heart and bone,
and cold be sleep under stone:
never mare to wake on stony bed,
never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.
In the black wind the stars shall die,
and still on gold here let them lie,
till the dark lord lifts his hand
over dead sea and withered land.
He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself on one arm he looked,
and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a
corner. Round the corner a long arm was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was
lying nearest, and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him.
At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation. Then a wild
thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight
would miss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of himself running free over the
grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would admit
that there had been nothing else he could do.
But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his
friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he

did so the arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay
beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions. With what strength he
had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off; but at the same moment
the sword splintered up to the hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was
a snarling noise.
Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once back into his mind, from
which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog, came the memory of the house down
under the Hill, and of Tom singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a
small desperate voice he began: _Ho! Tom Bombadil!_ and with that name his voice seemed to
grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet.
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,
By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!
Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!
There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart beating. After a long slow
moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick
walls, an answering voice singing:
Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,
Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.
None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:
His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.
There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and suddenly light streamed
in, real light, the plain light of day. A low door-like opening appeared at the end of the chamber
beyond Frodo's feet; and there was Tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of the
sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the faces of the three hobbits
lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they
were only very deeply asleep.
Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:
Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!
Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,
Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!
Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!
Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,
Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.
At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash.
Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away into an unguessable distance; and after that
silence.
'Come, friend Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean grass! You must help me bear them.'
Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom
went back in again, and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he
was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many
beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in
the sunshine.

There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and looked down upon the
three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound.
Raising his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice:
Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling!
Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;
Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.
Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!
To Frodo's great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, and then
suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing
large as life on the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned
and belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.
'What in the name of wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one
eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his face, and he closed his eyes. 'Of course, I
remember!' he said. 'The men of Carn Dûm came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! the
spear in my heart!' He clutched at his breast. 'No! No!' he said, opening his eyes. 'What am I
saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?'
'I thought that I was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of it. Let us think of what we are
to do now! Let us go on!'
'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung his circlet, belt, and rings
on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches,
and other hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand.
'You won't find your clothes again,' said Tom, bounding down from the mound, and laughing as
he danced round them in the sunlight. One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful
had happened; and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the
merry glint in his eyes.
'What do you mean?' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half amused. 'Why not?'
But Tom shook his head, saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of the deep water. Clothes
are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm
sunlight heal now heart and limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes
a-hunting!'
He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him Frodo saw him
running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and
crying:
Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?
Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?
Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,
White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!
So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he was hidden by a fold of the
ground: but for some time his _hey now! hoy now!_came floating back down the wind, which had
shifted round towards the south.
The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass, as he told
them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly
from bitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake one
day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise.
By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first,
over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line _six_ ponies: their own five and

one more. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than
their own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such
names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives.
Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed
to the hobbits.
'Here are your ponies, now!' he said. 'They've more sense (in some ways) than you wandering
hobbits have – more sense in their noses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into;
and if they run to save themselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for
though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow-wights is not what they were made for. See,
here they come again, bringing all their burdens!'
Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they
soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they
had brought against the oncoming of winter.
'Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?' asked Frodo.
'He's mine,' said Tom. 'My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often
far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and
they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he'd look for them and with his
words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom's going to ride.
Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily
talk to hobbits that are riding, when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them.'
The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; but he laughed, and said
that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe
over the borders of his land. 'I've got things to do,' he said: 'my making and my singing, my talking
and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can't be always near to open doors and
willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting.'
It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, and the hobbits turned their
minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before. They
breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that
Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and the circumstances), but
they felt much better for it. While they were eating Tom went up to the mound, and looked through
the treasures. Most of these he made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. He bade
them lie there 'free to all finders, birds, beasts. Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures'; for so the
spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for
himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of
blue butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his head, and saying at
last:
'Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long ago wore this on her
shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not forget her!'
For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous
workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from
their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery
stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the
blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.
'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,' he said. 'Sharp blades are good to
have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or far away into dark and danger.' Then he told them
that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the
Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dûm in the Land of Angmar.
'Few now remember them,' Tom murmured, 'yet still some go wandering, sons of forgotten
kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things folk that are heedless.'

The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great
expanse of years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men,
tall and grim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision faded,
and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. They made ready, packing their
bags and lading their ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their
jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not
before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them.
At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then mounting they trotted quickly
along the valley. They looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the
sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it
was hidden from view.
Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a
gate, and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell
away before them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before
them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of
the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an
ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.
They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had
imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it
until after nightfall on the day before. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line
of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side. Tom said that it
had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long lime ago. He seemed to remember
something sad about it, and would not say much.
They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, and then Tom turned due
north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the west. The land was now open and fairly level, and
they quickened their pace, but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall
trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures.
They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the long shadows of the trees.
They were on the top of a sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away
below them. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on their right it fell
quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain; there
were pools and pot-holes full of water. They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There
was nothing to be seen. 'Well, here we are again at last!' said Frodo. 'I suppose we haven't lost more
than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But perhaps the delay will prove useful – it may
have put them off our trail.'
The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over them
again. Ever since they had entered the Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road;
only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was
more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They looked anxiously back
towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and empty.
'Do you think,' asked Pippin hesitatingly, 'do you think we may be pursued, tonight?'
'No, I hope not tonight,' answered Tom Bombadil; 'nor perhaps the next day. But do not trust my
guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from
the Black Land far beyond his country.'
All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that he would know how to
deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly
strange to them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the
gathering twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them. They
stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only slowly became aware that Tom was
wishing them farewell, and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting.

'Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your own luck must go with you
and guide you): four miles along the Road you'll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with
doors looking westward. There you'll find an old inn that is called _The Prancing Pony._ Barliman
Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards the morning will speed
you upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!'
They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them; but he
laughed and refused, saying:
Tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders.
Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!
Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin's back, and rode up over the bank and
away singing into the dusk.
The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight.
'I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,' said Sam. 'He's a caution and no mistake. I reckon
we may go a good deal further and see naught better, nor queerer. But I won't deny I'll be glad to
see this _Prancing Pony_he spoke of. I hope it'll be like _The Green Dragon_ away back home!
What sort of folk are they in Bree?'
'There are hobbits in Bree,' said Merry, 'as well as Big Folk. I daresay it will be homelike
enough. _The Pony_ is a good inn by all accounts. My people ride out there now and again.'
'It may be all we could wish,' said Frodo; 'but it is outside the Shire all the same. Don't make
yourselves too much at home! Please remember -all of you – that the name of Baggins must NOT
be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.'
They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening. Darkness came down
quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some
distance ahead.
Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty stars; and under its
western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a
door between them and the night.
_Chapter 9_
At the Sign of
The Prancing Pony_
Bree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region, like an island in the empty
lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a
deep valley a little further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round Breehill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad.
The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful and independent: they
belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits,
Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of the world about them than was (or is) usual with Big
People. According to their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of
the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few had survived the turmoils
of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned again over the Great Sea they had found the Breemen still there, and they were still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the
grass.
In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within a hundred leagues of the
Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called
them Rangers, and knew nothing of their origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree

and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the languages of
beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far as the Misty
Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. When they appeared they brought news from
afar, and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make
friends of them.
There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land and _they_claimed to be the oldest
settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was founded long before even the Brandywine was
crossed and the Shire colonized. They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree
itself, especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men. The Big Folk and the
Little Folk (as they called one another) were on friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their
own ways, but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere else
in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.
The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the affairs of the four
villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the
Eastfarthing; but though their link land was not much further than a day's riding east of the
Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it. An occasional Bucklander or
adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming less
and less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond the
borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them, considering them dull and uncouth.
There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of the World in those days
than the people of the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to dig a
hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the Bree-land, at any rate, the
hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It
was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between
the Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.
The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk, mostly above the Road,
nestling on the hillside with windows looking west. On that side, running in more than half a circle
from the hill and back to it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this the
Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate. There
was another gate in the southern comer where the Road ran out of the village. The gates were
closed at nightfall; but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.
Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill, there was a large
inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at
an old meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside (he dike at the
western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various sorts had travelled
much on it. _Strange as News from Bree_ was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descending from
those days, when news from North, South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shirehobbits used to go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, and the
North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the Bree-folk called it the Greenway.
The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an important person. His house
was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small,
of the four villages; and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly
dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains.
It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his companions came at last to the
Greenway-crossing and drew near the village. They came to the West-gate and found it shut, but at
the door of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and fetched a lantern and
looked over the gate at them in surprise.
'What do you want, and where do you come from?' he asked gruffly.

'We are making for the inn here,' answered Frodo. 'We are journeying east and cannot go further
tonight.'
'Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what's more, out of the Shire by their talk,' said the gatekeeper,
softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the
gate and let them ride through.
'We don't often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,' he went on, as they halted a moment
by his door. 'You'll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east of Bree! What may
your names be, might I ask?'
'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good place to discuss them,'
said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice.
'Your business is your own, no doubt,' said the man; 'but it's my business to ask questions after
nightfall.'
'We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here,' put in
Merry. 'I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to
travellers, or so I had heard.'
'All right, all right!' said the man. 'I meant no offence. But you'll find maybe that more folk than
old Harry at the gate will be asking you questions. There's queer folk about. If you go on to _The
Pony,_ you'll find you're oat the only guests.'
He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see in the lantern-light that
the man was still eyeing them curiously. He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they
rode forward. He wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether any one had been asking
for _news of_ a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf? He might have arrived, while they
were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was something in the look and the voice of the
gatekeeper that made him uneasy.
The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to his house. As soon as
his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of
the village street.
The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, and drew up outside the
inn. The houses looked large and strange to them. Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys
and many windows, and felt his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than
trees, and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course of his journey; but
at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses quite enough, indeed too
much for the dark end of a tiring day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.
'We surely aren't going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?' he exclaimed. 'If there are hobbitfolk in these pans, why don't we look for some that would be willing to take us in? It would be
more homelike.'
'What's wrong with the inn?' said Frodo. 'Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it's homelike
enough inside.'
Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. It had a front on the
Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at
the rear the second-floor windows were level with the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a
courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached
by a few broad steps. The door was open and light streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a
lamp, and beneath it swung a large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the
door was painted in white letters: THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN BUTTERBUR. Many
of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.
As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, and many
cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment
and then got off their ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping.

They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the
steps. Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face.
He had a white apron on, and was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray
laden with full mugs.
'Can we-' began Frodo.
'Half a minute, if you please!' shouted the man over his shoulder, and vanished into a babel of
voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out again, wiping his hands on his apron.
'Good evening, little master!' he said, bending down. 'What may you be wanting?'
'Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. Are you Mr. Butterbur?'
'That's right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! You're from the Shire,
eh?' he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his forehead, as if trying to remember
something. 'Hobbits!' he cried. 'Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?'
'Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,' said Frodo; 'and this is Sam Gamgee. My name is Underhill.'
'There now!' said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. 'It's gone again! But it'll come back, when
I have time to think. I'm run off my feet; but I'll see what I can do for you. We don't often get a
party out of the Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is such
a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn't been for long enough. It never rains but it
pours, we say in Bree.
'Hi! Nob!' he shouted. 'Where are you, you woolly-footed slow-coach? Nob!'
'Coming, sir! Coming!' A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, and seeing the travellers,
stopped short and stared at them with great interest.
'Where's Bob?' asked the landlord. 'You don't know? Well find him! Double sharp! I haven't got
six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find
room somehow.' Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink.
'Well, now, what was I going to say?' said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his forehead. 'One thing drives
out another, so to speak. I'm that busy tonight, my head is going round. There's a party that came up
the Greenway from down South last night – and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there's
a travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now there's you. If you
weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we've got a room or two in the north wing that
were made special for hobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually
prefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you'll be comfortable. You'll be wanting
supper, I don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!'
He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. 'Here is a nice little parlour!' he
said. 'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It's
hard work for two legs, but I don't get thinner. I'll look in again later. If you want anything, ring the
hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don't come, ring and shout!'
Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable of an endless
stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found themselves in a small and cosy room. There
was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable
chairs. There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a large hand-bell.
But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought of ringing. He brought
candles and a tray full of plates.
'Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?' he asked. 'And shall I show you the bedrooms,
while your supper is got ready?'
They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. Butterbur and Nob
came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart,
new loaves, slabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could
show, and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam's misgivings (already much relieved by the
excellence of the beer).

The landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them. 'I don't know whether
you would care to join the company, when you have supped,' he said, standing at the door. 'Perhaps
you would rather go to your beds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you_,_ if
you had a mind. We don't get Outsiders – travellers from the Shire, I should say, begging your
pardon – often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in mind. But
as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack anything!'
So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an
hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join
the company. Merry said it would be too stuffy. 'I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and
perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don't forget that you are
supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still _on_ the high-road and not very far from the Shire!'
'All right!' said Pippin. 'Mind yourself! Don't get lost, and don't forget that it is safer indoors!'
The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was large and mixed, as
Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for
the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur
was standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange-looking men. On
the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering
together), a few more dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows
and comers.
As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome from the Bree-landers. The
strangers, especially those that had come up the Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord
introduced the newcomers to the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they
were seldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical
(and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore,
Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention Butterbur). Some of the hobbits had similar names. The
Mugworts, for instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as Banks,
Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which were used in the Shire. There
were several Underhills from Saddle, and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being
related, they took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin.
The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo soon found that some
explanation of what he was doing would have to be given. He gave out that he was interested in
history and geography (at which there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words
were much used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at which there was
silent astonishment), _and_ that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hobbits
living outside the Shire, especially in the eastern lands.
At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to write a book, and had had
many ears, he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not
enough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning with 'Old Barliman here', to whom he could
go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any _sign_ of writing a book on
the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very
communicative, and he soon found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around.
The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling flews of a kind that was
becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away in the South, and it seemed that the Men who
had come up the Greenway were on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace.
The Bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into
their little land. One of the travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more
and more people would be coming north in the near future. 'If room isn't found for them, they'll find
it for themselves. They've a right to live, same as other folk,' he said loudly. The local inhabitants
did not look pleased at the prospect.

The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, and it did not at the moment seem to concern
hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam
and Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire.
Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole
in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been
buried in chalk, and came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that
made Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in the Shire several
times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who they were related to.
Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, sitting in the shadows near
the wall, was also listening intently to the hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was
smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, showing
high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much wear and were now caked with
mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of
the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be
seen as he watched the hobbits.
'Who is that?' Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. Butterbur. 'I don't think you
introduced him?'
'Him?' said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye without turning his head. 'I
don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but
what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he
pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven't seen him about lately. What
his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace
on his long shanks; though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there's no
accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the Shire-folk, begging
your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.' But at that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained.
Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or guessed all that had been
said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him.
As Frodo drew near be threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey,
and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes.
'I am called Strider,' he said in a low voice. 'I am very pleased to meet you. Master – Underhill,
if old Butterbur got your name right.'
'He did,' said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes.
'Well, Master Underhill,' said Strider, 'if I were you, I should stop your young friends from
talking too much. Drink_,_ fire, and chance-meeting are pleasant enough, but, well – this isn't the
Shire. There are queer folk about. Though I say it as shouldn't, you may think,' he added with a wry
smile, seeing Frodo's glance. 'And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree lately,' he
went on, watching Frodo's face.
Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further sign. His attention seemed
suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took,
encouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic
account of Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the Speech, and was
drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance.
Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits, no doubt: just a
funny story about those funny people away beyond the River; but some (old Butterbur, for
instance) knew a thing or two, and had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo's vanishing. It
would bring the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after
that name.

Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was
getting, and had become quite forgetful of their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present
mood he might even mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.
'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear.
Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention of Pippin's audience was
disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr.
Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him.
Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit when making a speech)
fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire
came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if
me suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something a the room. He resisted the
temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from
escaping or doing _any_ mischief. At any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke 'a few suitable
words', as they would have said in the Shire: _We are all very much gratified by the kindness of
your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of friendship
between the Shire and Bree;_and then he hesitated and coughed.
Everyone in the room was now looking at him. 'A song!' shouted one of the hobbits. 'A song! A
song!' shouted all the others. 'Come on now, master, sing us something that we haven't heard
before!'
For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo
had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud of, for he had made up the words himself). It was
about an inn; and that is probably why it came into Frodo's mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a
few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered.
There is an inn, a merry old inn
beneath an old grey hill,
And there they brew a beer so brown
That the Man in the Moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill.
The ostler has a tipsy cat
that plays a five-stringed fiddle;
And up and down he runs his bow,
Now squeaking high, now purring low,
now sawing in the middle.
The landlord keeps a little dog
that is mighty fond of jokes;
When there's good cheer among the guests,
He cocks an ear at all the jests
and laughs until he chokes.
They also keep a horned cow
as proud as any queen;
But music turns her head like ale,
And makes her wave her tufted tail
and dance upon the green.
And O! the rows of silver dishes
and the store of silver spoons!

For Sunday there's a special pair,
And these they polish up with care
on Saturday afternoons.
The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,
and the cat began to wail;
A dish and a spoon on the table danced,
The cow in the garden madly pranced,
and the little dog chased his tail.
The Man in the Moon took another mug,
and then rolled beneath his chair;
And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,
Till in the sky the stars were pale,
and dawn was in the air.
Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:
'The white horses of the Moon,
They neigh and champ their silver bits;
But their master's been and drowned his wits,
and the Sun'll be rising soon!'
So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,
a jig that would wake the dead:
He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,
While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:
'It's after three!' he said.
They rolled the Man slowly up the hill
and bundled him into the Moon,
While his horses galloped up in rear,
And the cow came capering like a deer,
and a dish ran up with the spoon.
Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;
the dog began to roar,
The cow and the horses stood on their heads;
The guests all bounded from their beds
and danced upon the floor.
With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!
the cow jumped over the Moon,
And the little dog laughed to see such fun,
And the Saturday dish went off at a run
with the silver Sunday spoon.
The round Moon rolled behind the hill
as the Sun raised up her head.
She hardly believed her fiery eyes;
For though it was day, to her surprise

they all went back to bed!
There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song tickled their fancy.
'Where's old Barley?' they cried. 'He ought to hear this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and
then we'd have a dance.' They called for more ale, and began to shout: 'Let's have it again, master!
Come on now! Once more!'
They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again, while many of them joined
in; for the tune was well known, and they were quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo's turn
to feel pleased with himself. He capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to
_the cow jumped over the Moon,_ he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for he came down,
bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off the table with a crash, clatter, and bump!
The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the
singer disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a
hole!
The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet and shouted for Barliman.
All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam, who found themselves left alone in a comer, and
eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as
the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But there was one
swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and half-mocking expression that
made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he slipped out of the door, followed by the squinteyed southerner: the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening. Harry the
gatekeeper also went out just behind them..
Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under the tables to the dark
comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the
wall and took off the Ring. How it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only
suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had slipped
on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a moment he wondered if the Ring
itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or
command that was felt in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.
'Well?' said Strider, when he reappeared. 'Why did you do that? Worse than anything your
friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or should I say your finger?'
'I don't know what you mean,' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.
'Oh yes, you do,' answered Strider; 'but we had better wait until the uproar has died down. Then,
if you please, Mr. _Baggins, I_ should like a quiet word with you.'
'What about?' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name.
'A matter of some importance – to us both,' answered Strider, looking Frodo in the eye. 'You
may hear something to your advantage.'
'Very well,' said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. 'I'll talk to you later.'
Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had come trotting in, and
he was now trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time.
'I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,' said a hobbit; 'or leastways I didn't see him, if you take my meaning.
He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of speaking.'
'You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled.
'Yes I do!' replied Mugwort. 'And I mean what I say, what's more.'
'There's some mistake somewhere,' said Butterbur, shaking his head. There was too much of that
Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or into thick air, as is more likely in this room.'
'Well, where is he now?' cried several voices.
'How should I know? He's welcome to go where he will, so long as he pays in the morning.
There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.'

'Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn't,' said Mugwort obstinately.
'And I say there's some mistake,' repeated Butterbur, picking up the tray and gathering up the
broken crockery.
'Of course there's a mistake!' said Frodo. 'I haven't vanished. Here I am! I've just been having a
few words with Strider in the comer.'
He came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed away,_,_ even more
perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled
away quickly under the tables after he had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went
off then and there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One or two
gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves and the two or
three strange Men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo
and his friends. Before long no one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.
Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably, that his house would be
full again on many future nights, until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed. 'Now
what have you been doing, Mr. Underhill?' he asked. 'Frightening my customers and breaking up
my crocks with your acrobatics!'
'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said Frodo. 'It was quite unintentional, I assure you.
A most unfortunate accident.'
'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going to do any more tumbling, or conjuring, or whatever
it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand – and warn _me._ We're a bit suspicious round here of
anything out of the way -uncanny, if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.'
'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise you. And now I think I'll
be getting to bed. We shall be making an early start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight
o'clock?'
'Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in private, Mr. Underhill.
Something has just come back to my mind that I ought to tell you. I hope that you'll not take it
amiss. When I've seen to a thing or two, I'll come along to your room, if you're willing.'
'Certainly!' said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many private talks he would have
before he got to bed, and what they would reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He
began to suspect even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs.
_Chapter 10_
Strider
Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. Merry was not
there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and
thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was
calmly sitting in a chair by the door!
'Hallo!' said Pippin. 'Who are you, and what do you want?'
'I am called Strider,' he answered: 'and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to
have a quiet talk with me.'
'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,' said Frodo. 'What have you to
say?'
'Several things,' answered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.'
'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply.
'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you some good advice
– but I shall want a reward.'

'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal,
and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him. All of it would
hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.
'No more than you can afford,' answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo's
thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you, until I wish to leave you.'
'Oh, indeed!' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'Even if I wanted another
companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your
business.'
'Excellent!' exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably. 'You seem to be
coming to your senses again, and that is all to the good. You have been much too careless so far.
Very well! I will tell you what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it,
when you have heard me.'
'Go on then!' said Frodo. 'What do you know?'
'Too much; too many dark things,' said Strider grimly. 'But as for your business -' He got up and
went to the door, opened it quickly and looked out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. 'I
have quick ears,' he went on, lowering his voice, 'and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted
many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind the
hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need
not repeat all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. _Please
remember,_ said one of them, _that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill,
if any name must be given._ That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over
the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind;
but if so, I should advise him and his friends to be more careful.'
'I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,' said Frodo angrily, 'and I have still
to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping;
but if so, I should advise him to explain it.'
'Well answered!' said Strider laughing. 'But the explanation is simple:
I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him quickly. I had learned
that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.
'Now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam jumped up with a scowl.
'I shall take more care of the secret than you do. And care is needed!' He leaned forward and looked
at them. 'Watch every shadow!' he said in a low voice. 'Black horsemen have passed through Bree.
On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming up the
Greenway from the south.'
There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: 'I ought to have guessed it from the
way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said. 'And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did
he press us to join the company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have
stayed quiet in here.'
'It would have been better,' said Strider. 'I would have stopped your going into the commonroom, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you, or take a message.'
'Do you think he–––' began Frodo.
'No, I don't think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious
vagabonds of my sort.' Frodo gave him a puzzled look. 'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I
not?' said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. 'But I hope we shall get to
know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your
song. For that little prank–––'
'It was sheer accident!' interrupted Frodo.
'I wonder,' said Strider. 'Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.'

'Hardly more than it was already,' said Frodo. 'I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; but
now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away.'
'You must not count on that!' said Strider sharply. 'They will return. And more are coming.
There are others. I know their number. I know these Riders.' He paused, and his eyes were cold and
hard. 'And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,' he went on. 'Bill Ferny, for
instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his house. You must have
noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with one of the
Southern strangers, and they slipped out together just after your "accident". Not all of those
Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for
amusement.'
'What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?' said Frodo, still determined
not to understand Strider's hints.
'News of you, of course,' answered Strider. 'An account of your performance would be very
interesting to certain people. After that they would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems
to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can do
as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands
between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for many years. I am
older than I look. I might prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the
horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go forward
while the Sun is up; but you won't go far. They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place
where there is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They are terrible!'
The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, and his
hands clenched the arms of his chair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to
have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening
to sounds in the Night far away.
'There!' he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. 'Perhaps I know more about
these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you
will have to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you
have him?'
There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused with doubt and fear.
Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:
'With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no! This Strider here, he warns and he says take care; and I
_say yes_ to that, and let's begin with him. He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of
such folk. He knows something, that's plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we should
let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it.'
Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned his keen eyes
on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. 'No,' he said slowly. 'I don't agree. I think, I
think you are not really as you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your
voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should warn us to take care,
and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you really know
about – about my business; and how do you know it?'
'The lesson in caution has been well learned,' said Strider with a grim smile. 'But caution is one
thing and wavering is another. You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is
your only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will
help you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still here it
is–––'
At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had arrived with candles, and
behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.

'I've come to bid you good night,' said the landlord, putting the candles on the table. 'Nob! Take
the water to the rooms!' He came in and shut the door.
'It's like this,' he began, hesitating and looking troubled. 'If I've done any harm, I'm sorry indeed.
But one thing drives out another, as you'll admit; and I'm a busy man. But first one thing and then
another this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I
was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular.'
'And what has that got to do with me?' asked Frodo.
'Ah! you know best,' said the landlord, knowingly. 'I won't give you away; but I was told that
this Baggins would be going by the name of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you
well enough, if I may say so.'
'Indeed! Let's have it then!' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.
_'A stout little fellow with red cheeks,'_ said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, but Sam
looked indignant. _'That won't help you much; it goes for most hobbits. Barley,_ he says to me,'
continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. _'But this one is taller than some and fairer than
most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye._ Begging your pardon, but he
said it, not me.'
_'He_ said it? And who was he?' asked Frodo eagerly.
'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, but he's a good friend
of mine, whether or no. But now I don't know what he'll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn
all my ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn't wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still what's done
can't be undone. '
'Well, what have you done?' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling of
Butterbur's thoughts.
'Where was I?' said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. 'Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three
months back he walked right into my room without a knock. _Barley,_ he says, _I'm off in the
morning. Will you do something for me? You've only to name it,_ I said. _I'm in a hurry,_ said he,
_and I've no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you anyone you can send,
and trust to go? I can find someone,_ I said, _tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it
tomorrow,_ he says, and then he gave me a letter.
'It's addressed plain enough,' said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter from his pocket, and reading
out the address slowly and proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):
_Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE._
'A letter for me from Gandalf!' cried Frodo.
'Ah!' said Mr. Butterbur. 'Then your right name is Baggins?'
'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain why you never sent
it. That's what you came to tell me, I suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the
point.'
Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. 'You're right, master,' he said, 'and I beg your pardon. And
I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it. But I didn't keep it back a-purpose.
I put it by safe. Then I couldn't find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day after,
and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind.
I'm a busy man. I'll do what I can to set matters right, and if there's any help I can give, you've only
to name it.
'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. _Barley,_ he says to me, _this friend of
mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him and another. He'll be calling
himself Underhill. Mind that! But you need ask no questions. And if I'm not with him, he may be in
trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I'll be grateful,_ he says. And
here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.'

'What do you mean?' asked Frodo.
'These black men,' said the landlord lowering his voice. 'They're looking for _Baggins,_ and if
they mean well, then I'm a hobbit. It was on Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the
geese screaming. Uncanny, I called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the
door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be
off, and slammed the door on them; but they've been asking the same question all the way to
Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he's been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see
you, before you'd had bite or sup, he did.'
'He did!' said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. 'And much trouble would have
been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.'
The landlord jumped with surprise. 'You!' he cried. 'You're always popping up. What do you
want now?'
'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo. 'He came to offer me his help.'
'Well, you know your own business, maybe,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider.
'But if I was in your plight, I wouldn't take up with a Ranger.'
'Then who would you take up with?' asked Strider. 'A fat innkeeper who only remembers his
own name because people shout it at him all day? They cannot stay in _The Pony_ for ever, and
they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them and keep the
black men off?'
'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared.
'But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings on?
What are these black men after, and where do they come from, I'd like to know?'
'I'm sorry I can't explain it all,' answered Frodo. 'I am tired and very worried, and it's a long tale.
But if you mean to help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your
house. These Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from–––'
'They come from Mordor,' said Strider in a low voice. 'From Mordor, Barliman, if that means
anything to you.'
'Save us!' cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was known to him. 'That is the
worst news that has come to Bree in my time.' 'It is,' said Frodo. 'Are you still willing to help me?' 'I
am,' said Mr. Butterbur. 'More than ever. Though I don't know what the likes of me can do against,
against–––' he faltered.
'Against the Shadow in the East,' said Strider quietly. 'Not much, Barliman, but every little
helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the name
of Baggins, till he is far away.'
'I'll do that,' said Butterbur. 'But they'll find out he's here without help from me, I'm afraid. It's a
pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr.
Bilbo's going off has been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some
guessing in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he is.'
'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo.
'I hope not, indeed,' said Butterbur. 'But spooks or no spooks, they won't get in _The Pony_so
easy. Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say no word. No black man shall pass my doors,
while I can stand on my legs. Me and my folk'll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some
sleep, if you can.'
'In any case we must be called at dawn,' said Frodo. 'We must get off as early as possible.
Breakfast at six-thirty, please.'
'Right! I'll see to the orders,' said the landlord. 'Good night, Mr. Baggins – Underhill, I should
say! Good night – now, bless me! Where's your Mr. Brandybuck?'
'I don't know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all about Merry, and it was
getting late. 'I am afraid he is out. He said something about going for a breath of air.'

'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on a holiday!' said
Butterbur. 'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll see your friend is let in when he comes. I'd
better send Nob to look for him. Good night to you all!' At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with
another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated down the passage.
'Well?' said Strider. 'When are you going to open that letter?' Frodo looked carefully at the seal
before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be Gandalf's. Inside, written in the wizard's strong but
graceful script, was the following message:
_THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418._
_Dear Frodo,_
_Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, and
get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow
you, if I find that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can
trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall,
by some called Strider. He knows our business and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope
we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you._
_Yours in haste_
_GANDALF_.
_PS. Do NOT use It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by night!_
_PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men on the roads. His true
name is Aragorn_.
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.
_PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a
lumber-room: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I shall roast him._
_Fare Well!_
Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. 'Really old Butterbur has
made a mess of things!' he said. 'He deserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have
been safe in Rivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he was
going into great danger.'
'He has been doing that for many years,' said Strider.
Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript.
'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at once?' he asked. 'It would have saved
time.'

'Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?' said Strider. 'I knew nothing of this
letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any
case, I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once. I had to study _you_ first, and make sure
of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was
ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,' he added with a queer laugh, 'that I hoped
you would take to me for my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for
friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.'
'They are – at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's
letter. 'But handsome is as handsome does, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look
much the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches.'
'It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild to make you
look like Strider,' he answered. 'And you would die first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than
you look to be.'
Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider dubiously. 'How do we
know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?' he demanded. 'You never mentioned Gandalf,
till this letter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with
you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have you to say to that?'
'That you are a stout fellow,' answered Strider; 'but I am afraid my only answer to you, Sam
Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you
already without so much talk. If I was after the Ring, I could have it – NOW!'
He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen and
commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung
concealed by his side. They did not dare to move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.
'But I _am_ the real Strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them with his face softened by
a sudden smile. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.'
There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. 'I believed that you were a friend
before the letter came,' he said, 'or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times
tonight, but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of his
spies would – well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.'
'I see,' laughed Strider. 'I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? _All that is gold does not glitter, not
all those who wander are lost.'_
'Did the verses apply to you then?' asked Frodo. 'I could not make out what they were about. But
how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen it?'
'I did not know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name.' He drew
out his sword, and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. 'Not much use is
it, Sam?' said Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.'
Sam said nothing.
'Well,' said Strider, 'with Sam's permission we will call that settled. Strider shall be your guide.
We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can
hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or
two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the pursuit, I shall make
for Weathertop.'
'Weathertop?' said Sam. 'What's that?'
'It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell. It commands a
wide view all round; and there we shall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that
point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have
to choose between various dangers.'
'When did you last see Gandalf?' asked Frodo. 'Do you know where he is, or what he is doing?'

Strider looked grave. 'I do not know,' he said. 'I came west with him in the spring. I have often
kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He
seldom left it unguarded. We last met on the first of May: at Sam Ford down the Brandywine. He
told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for Rivendell in
the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own.
And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.
'I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should have had messages, even if
he could not come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had
gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk
of Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but there was no
news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Road anxiously.'
'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – with Gandalf's absence, I mean?'
asked Frodo.
'I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy himself,' said
Strider. 'But do not give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can
only see his jokes and toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.'
Pippin yawned. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I am dead tired. In spite of all the danger and worry I
must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if
we had to go out in the dark to look for him.'
At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage. Merry came
in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of
breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen them, Frodo! I
have seen them! Black Riders!'
'Black Riders!' cried Frodo. 'Where?'
'Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, I went out for
a stroll. I had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the
stars. Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son of
deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight. It slid
away at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse.'
'Which way did it go?' asked Strider, suddenly and sharply. Merry started, noticing the stranger
for the first time. 'Go on!' said Frodo. 'This is a friend of Gandalf's. I will explain later.'
'It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,' continued Merry. 'I tried to follow. Of course, it
vanished almost at once; but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.'
Strider looked at Merry with wonder. 'You have a stout heart,' he said; 'but it was foolish.'
'I don't know,' said Merry. 'Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed
to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was
muttering; and the other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not
creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt terrified, and I turned back, and
was just going to bolt home, when something came behind me and I... I fell over.'
'I found him, sir,' put in Nob. 'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went down to Westgate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny's house I thought I could see
something in the Road. I couldn't swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over
something, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there was no signs of them, and
only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. "I thought I had fallen into
deep water," he says to me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him,
he got up and ran back here like a hare.'
'I am afraid that's true,' said Merry, 'though I don't know what I said. I had an ugly dream, which
I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't know what came over me.'

'I do,' said Strider. 'The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, and passed
back through the South-gate in secret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill
Ferny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before
we leave Bree.'
'What will happen?' said Merry. 'Will they attack the inn?' 'No, I think not,' said Strider. 'They
are not all here yet. And in any case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest;
they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they are
desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror,
and already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work:
Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at
West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when they left him.'
'We seem to have enemies all round,' said Frodo. 'What are we to do?'
'Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have found out which those are. The
hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground. We will all remain together and
bar this window and the door. But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.'
While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since
supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and Nob returned.
'Well Masters,' said Nob, 'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of
each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag –
Underhill, sir,' he added with a grin.
Pippin laughed. 'Very life-like!' he said. 'But what will happen when they have penetrated the
disguise?'
'We shall see,' said Strider. 'Let us hope to hold the fort till morning.'
'Good night to you,' said Nob, and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors.
Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against the door
and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging
bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and
drew the curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.
The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth; but Strider settled
himself in the chair against the door. They talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to
ask.
'Jumped over the Moon!' chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his blanket. 'Very ridiculous of
you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see. The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred
years hence.'
'I hope so,' said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep.
_Chapter 11_
A Knife in the Dark
As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on Buckland; a mist strayed in the
dells and along the river-bank. The house at Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door
cautiously and peered out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to
rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. As he stared out into the
gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close
again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in
the hall. Then he shut and locked the door.
The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane. Outside
the gate they stopped, and three black figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the
ground. One went to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they stood, as

still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to
be waiting breathlessly.
There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The cold hour before dawn was
passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed,
as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered.
'Open, in the name of Mordor!' said a voice thin and menacing.
At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The black
figures passed swiftly in.
At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the night like fire on a hill-top.
AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE!
Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden, he
knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did, out of the back door, through the garden,
and over the fields. When he reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the
doorstep. 'No, no, no!' he was crying. 'No, not me! I haven't got it!' It was some time before anyone
could make out what he was babbling about. At last they got the idea that enemies were in
Buckland, some strange invasion from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time.
FEAR! FIRE! FOES!
The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not been sounded for a
hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was
frozen over.
AWAKE! AWAKE!
Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black figures fled from
the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs
broke out, and gathering to a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about
Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the
Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow! Sauron would deal with
them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that the house was empty and the
Ring had gone. They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.
In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound or presence had
disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the
fire, which had been tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement.
Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and
of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he
heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard.
Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. The first grey light of day
was in the room, and a cold air was coming through the open window.
As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their bedrooms. When they saw them
they were glad that they had taken his advice: the windows had been forced open and were
swinging, and the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and
flung upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces.

Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy and
frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he said), but he had never heard a sound.
'Never has such a thing happened in my time!' he cried, raising his hands in horror. 'Guests
unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters ruined and all! What are we coming to?'
'Dark times,' said Strider. 'But for the present you may be left in peace, when you have got rid of
us. We will leave at once. Never mind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do.
We shall be packed in a few minutes.'
Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and to fetch them a 'bite'. But
very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened
in the night, and they were gone: not only Merry's ponies, but every other horse and beast in the
place.
Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell on foot, pursued by
mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at
the hobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength and courage.
'Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,' he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed
what Frodo had in mind. 'We should not go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to
take. I was going to walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count on
getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to
take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way.
How much are you prepared to carry on your backs?'
'As much as we must,' said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to show that he was tougher
than he looked (or felt).
'I can carry enough for two,' said Sam defiantly.
'Can't anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?' asked Frodo. 'Can't we get a couple of ponies in the
village, or even one just for the baggage? I don't suppose we could hire them, but we might be able
to buy them,' he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it.
'I doubt it,' said the landlord unhappily. 'The two or three riding-ponies that there were in Bree
were stabled in my yard, and they're gone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or
what not, there are very few of them in Bree, and they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I can. I'll
rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.'
'Yes,' said Strider reluctantly, 'you had better do that. I am afraid we shall have to try to get one
pony at least. But so ends all hope of starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well
have blown a horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.'
'There is one crumb of comfort,' said Merry, 'and more than a crumb, I hope: we can have
breakfast while we wait – and sit down to it. Let's get hold of Nob!'
In the end there was more than three hours' delay. Bob came back with the report that no horse
or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood – except one: Bill Ferny had one that
he might possibly sell. 'A poor old half-starved creature it is,' said Bob; 'but he won't part with it for
less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if I knows Bill Ferny.'
'Bill Ferny?' said Frodo. 'Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't the beast bolt back to him with all our
stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?'
'I wonder,' said Strider. 'But I cannot imagine any animal running home to him, once it got
away. I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind Master Ferny's: just a way of increasing his profits
from the affair. The chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death's door. But there does
not seem any choice. What does he want for it?'
Bill Ferny's price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at least three times the pony's
value in those pans. It proved to be a bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like
dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some
compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and well-off as things were reckoned in

Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it
harder to bear.
As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned out later that only one
horse had been actually stolen. The others had been driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were
found wandering in different corners of the Bree-land. Merry's ponies had escaped altogether, and
eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in search of Fatty
Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while, and were well-off. But when
news of the events at Bree came to Tom's ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five
good beasts at a very fair price. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so on
the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But they never came to
Rivendell.
However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone for good, or for bad.
And he had other troubles. For there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were
astir and heard news of the raid on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and
blamed the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had also
disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell on him
at once.
'If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,' said Butterbur angrily, 'you ought
to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your
handsome friend is!' But it appeared that he was nobody's friend, and nobody could recollect when
he had joined their party.
After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together further supplies for the longer
journey they were now expecting. It was close on ten o'clock before they at last got off. By that
time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; the appearance of the
black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that Strider the Ranger had
joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years. Most of
the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the
road to see the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the
windows.
Strider had changed his mind, and he decided to leave Bree by the main road. Any attempt to set
off across country at once would only make matters worse: half the inhabitants would follow them,
to see what they were up to, and to prevent them from trespassing.
They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with many thanks. 'I hope
we shall meet again some day, when things are merry once more,' said Frodo. 'I should like nothing
better than to stay in your house in peace for a while.'
They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. Not all the faces were
friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the
Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with
Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as
much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it
approved of the change in its fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket
full of them: a parting present from Nob and Bob. 'Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting,' he
said. 'But I reckon I'll miss them both before long.'
The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors, or popped over
walls and fences, as they passed. But as they drew near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept
house behind a thick hedge: the last house in the village. In one of the windows he caught a glimpse
of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once.
'So that's where that southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'He looks more than half like a goblin.'

Over the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black brows, and dark scornful
eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he
took it out of his mouth and spat.
'Morning, Longshanks!' he said. 'Off early? Found some friends at last?' Strider nodded, but did
not answer. 'Morning, my little friends!' he said to the others. 'I suppose you know who you've
taken up with? That's Stick-at-naught Strider, that is! Though I've heard other names not so pretty.
Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don't go ill-treating my poor old pony! Pah!' He spat again.
Sam turned quickly. 'And you. Ferny,' he said, 'put your ugly face out of sight, or it will get
hurt.' With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose.
He ducked too late, and curses came from behind the hedge. 'Waste of a good apple,' said Sam
regretfully, and strode on.
At last they left the village behind. The escort of children and stragglers that had followed them
got tired and turned back at the South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some
miles. It bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet of Bree-hill, and
then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country. To their left they could see some of
the houses and hobbit-holes of Staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a
deep hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe
lay;
Archet was hidden in the trees beyond.
After the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing tall and brown behind,
they came on a narrow track that led off towards the North. 'This is where we leave the open and
take to cover,' said Strider.
'Not a "short cut", I hope,' said Pippin. 'Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in
disaster.'
'Ah, but you had not got me with you then,' laughed Strider. 'My cuts, short or long, don't go
wrong.' He took a look up and down the Road. No one was in sight; and he led the way quickly
down towards the wooded valley.
His plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the country, was to go towards
Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to Weathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great loop of
the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater Marshes. But, of course, they
would have to pass through the marshes themselves, and Strider's description of them was not
encouraging.
However, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if it had not been for the
disturbing events of the night before, they would have enjoyed this pan of the journey better than
any up to that time. The sun was shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still
leafy and full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. Strider guided them confidently
among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss.
He was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit.
'Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,' he said; 'though I don't think
he will follow us himself. He knows the land round here well enough, but he knows he is not a
match for me in a wood. It is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don't suppose they are far
away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.'
Whether because of Strider's skill or for some other reason, they saw no sign and heard no sound
of any other living thing all that day: neither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one
fox and a few squirrels. The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and still all was
quiet and peaceful. On the third day out from Bree they came out of the Chetwood. The land had
been falling steadily, ever since they turned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide flat

expanse of country, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the borders of the Breeland, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the Midge-water Marshes.
The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools,
and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds. They had to
pick their way carefully to keep both dry-footed and on their proper course. At first they made fanprogress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more dangerous. The marshes were
bewildering and treacherous, and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers to find through
their shifting quagmires. The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny
midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair.
'I am being eaten alive!' cried Pippin. 'Midgewater! There are more midges than water!'
'What do they live on when they can't get hobbit?' asked Sam, scratching his neck.
They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their camping-place was
damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects would not let them sleep. There were also
abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil
relatives of the cricket. There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, _neek-breek,
breek-neek,_ unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were nearly frantic.
The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as comfortless. Though the
Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left behind, the midges still pursued them.
As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that far away there came a
light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some
hours off.
'What is the light?' he said to Strider, who had risen, and was standing, gazing ahead into the
night.
'I do not know,' Strider answered. 'It is too distant to make out. It is like lightning that leaps up
from the hill-tops.'
Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white flashes, and against them
the tall dark figure of Strider, standing silent and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep.
They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and reed-beds of
the marshes behind them. The land before them began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance
eastward they could now see a line of hills. The highest of them was at the right of the line and a
little separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly flattened at the summit.
'That is Weathertop,' said Strider. 'The Old Road, which we have left far away on our right, runs
to the south of it and passes not far from its foot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go
straight towards it. I suppose we had better do so.'
'What do you mean?' asked Frodo.
'I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It is close to the Road.'
'But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?'
'Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through Bree, and so he
may not know what we are doing. And anyway, unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall
miss one another; it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find us
in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves. It commands a wide view all
round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as we stand here,
from that hill-top. Not all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than they
are.'
The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into the pale sky, fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes. 'You do make me feel
uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!' he said.
'What do you advise us to do?' asked Frodo.

'I think,' answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, 'I think the best thing is to go as
straight eastward from here as we can, to make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we
can strike a path I know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north and less
openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.'
All that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came down. The land became
drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy
birds were piping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then
an empty silence fell. The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful
windows of Bag End far away.
At the day's end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshland, and they went up along its banks while the light lasted. It was already night
when at last they halted and made their camp under some stunted alder-trees by the shores of the
stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills.
That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and
in the early night-hours a cold grey light lay on the land.
Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost in the air, and the sky was
a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already
they were getting used to much walking on short commons – shorter at any rate than what in the
Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs. Pippin declared that Frodo
was looking twice the hobbit that he had been.
'Very odd,' said Frodo, tightening his belt, 'considering that there is actually a good deal less of
me. I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.'
'Do not speak of such things!' said Strider quickly, and with surprising earnestness.
The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising almost to a thousand feet,
and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond. Along
the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and
dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone. By night they had reached
the feet of the westward slopes, and there they camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, and
they were six days out from Bree.
In the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the Chetwood, a track plain to
see. They turned right and followed it southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed
chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of
the flats to the west. It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and where it passed over flatter
and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that
screened the travellers almost like a hedge.
'I wonder who made this path, and what for,' said Merry, as they walked along one of these
avenues, where the stones were unusually large and closely set. 'I am not sure that I like it: it has a
– well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?'
'No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,' answered Strider. 'The Men of
the West did not live here; though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the
evil that came out of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But long
before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower on Weathertop,
Amon Sûl they called it. It was burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled
ring, like a rough crown on the old hill's head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that Elendil
stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in the days of the Last Alliance.'
The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old lore, as well as in the ways of
the wild. 'Who was Gil-galad?' asked Merry; but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in
thought. Suddenly a low voice murmured:

Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing:
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.
His sword was long, his lance was keen,
his shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirrored in his silver shield.
But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.
The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam's.
'Don't stop!' said Merry.
'That's all I know,' stammered Sam, blushing. 'I learned it from Mr. Bilbo when I was a lad. He
used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr.
Bilbo as taught me my letters. He was mighty book-learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote
_poetry._ He wrote what I have just said.'
'He did not make it up,' said Strider. 'It is pan of the lay that is called _The Fall of Gil-galad,_
which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have translated it. I never knew that.'
'There was a lot more,' said Sam, 'all about Mordor. I didn't learn that part, it gave me the shivers
I never thought I should be going that way myself!'
'Going to Mordor!' cried Pippin. 'I hope it won't come to that!'
'Do not speak that name so loudly!' said Strider.
It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them,
in the pale clear light of the October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the
northward slope of the hill They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad
Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing
them. Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign
of him.
On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at the bottom of which there
was a bowl-shaped dell with grassy sides. There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their
packs and luggage. The other three went on. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the
crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last slope had been steep and
rocky.
On the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient stonework, now crumbling or
covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled. They were
blackened as if with fire. About them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the
grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but there was no sign of any
living thing.
Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide prospect, for
the most pan of lands empty and featureless, except for patches of woodland away to the south,
beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water. Beneath them on this southern
side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and winding up and down, until it

faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. Nothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward
with their eyes they saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre;
behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were high white peaks
glimmering among the clouds.
'Well, here we are!' said Merry. 'And very cheerless and uninviting it looks! There is no water
and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don't blame him for not waiting – if he ever came
here.'
'I wonder,' said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. 'Even if he was a day or two behind us at
Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride very swiftly when need presses.' Suddenly he
stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as
if it had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his fingers. "This has been
handled recently,' he said. 'What do you think of these marks?'
On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches: 'There seems to he a stroke, a dot, and three
more strokes,' he said.
'The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,' said Strider. 'It might be a sign left
by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But
the marks might mean something quite different, and have nothing to do with us. Rangers use
runes, and they come here sometimes.'
'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry
'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here
on October the third: that is three days ago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry and
danger was at hand, so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If
that is so, we must be wary.'
'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,' said Frodo 'It
would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us.'
'Perhaps,' said Strider. 'For myself, I believe that he was here, and was in danger. There have
been scorching flames here; and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind. I guess that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result I cannot
tell. He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to
Rivendell, as best we can '
'How far is Rivendell?' asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild and wide
from Weathertop.
'I don't know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the _Forsaken Inn,_ a day's
journey east of Bree,' answered Strider. 'Some say it is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a
strange road, and folk are glad to reach their journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I
know how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days
from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell.
We have at least a fortnight's journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.'
'A fortnight!' said Frodo. 'A lot may happen in that time.'
'It may,' said Strider.
They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge. In that lonely place Frodo
for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had
left him in the quiet and beloved Shire. He stared down at the hateful Road, leading back westward
– to his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it, going
westward; and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He
gave a cry and clutched Strider's arm.
'Look,' he said, pointing downwards.
At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside
him. Merry threw himself alongside.
'What is it?' he whispered.

'I do not know, but I fear the worst,' answered Strider.
Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered through a cleft between two
jagged stones. The light was no longer bright, for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping
out of the East had now overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black
specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told
them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.
'Yes,' said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. 'The enemy is here!'
Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions.
Sam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small dell and the surrounding
slopes. Not far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside, and near it footprints not
more than a day or two old. In the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a
hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill. Behind them
Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked.
'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin. 'Whoever it was put this stuff here
meant to come back it seems.'
Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. 'I wish I had waited and explored the ground
down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints.
'It is just as I feared,' he said, when he came back. 'Sam and Pippin have trampled the soft
ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers have been here lately. It is they who left the
firewood behind. But there are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers. At least
one set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. At least one. I cannot now be certain, but
I think there were many booted feet.' He paused and stood in anxious thought.
Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders. If the horsemen
had already found the dell, the sooner Strider led them somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the
hollow with great dislike, now that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road, only a few
miles away.
'Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?' he asked impatiently. 'It is getting late, and I don't
like this hole: it makes my heart sink somehow.'
'Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,' answered Strider, looking up and considering
the time and the weather. 'Well, Sam,' he said at last, 'I do not like this place either; but I cannot
think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out of sight for the
moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies. All we could do
would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills, where the land is all
much the same as it is here. The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to take
cover in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road beyond the hills the country
is bare and flat for miles.'
'Can the Riders _see?'_ asked Merry. 'I mean, they seem usually to have used their noses rather
than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the right word, at least in the daylight. But you made
us lie down flat when you saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.'
'I was too careless on the hill-top,' answered Strider. 'I was very anxious to find some sign of
Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long. For the black horses
can see, and the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They
themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast shadows in their minds,
which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are
hidden from us: then they are most to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living
things, desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. We can feel their
presence – it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, and before we saw them; they feel ours
more keenly. Also,' he added, and his voice sank to a whisper, 'the Ring draws them.'

'Is there no escape then?' said Frodo, looking round wildly. 'If I move I shall be seen and hunted!
If I stay, I shall draw them to me!'
Strider laid his hand on his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said. 'You are not alone. Let us take
this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall
serve for both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these Riders do not love
it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in the wilderness.'
'Maybe,' muttered Sam. 'It is also as good a way of saying "here we are" as I can think of, bar
shouting.'
Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire, and prepared a meal. The
shades of evening began to fall, and it grew cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for
they had not eaten anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper.
The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places deserted by all the races
of the world. Rangers passed at times beyond the hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other
wanderers were rare, and of evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of
the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often dwarves, hurrying
along on business of their own, and with no help and few words to spare for strangers.
'I don't see how our food can be made to last,' said Frodo. 'We have been careful enough in the
last few days, and this supper is no feast; but we have used more than we ought, if we have two
weeks still to go, and perhaps more.'
'There is food in the wild,' said Strider; 'berry, root, and herb; and I have some skill as a hunter
at need. You need not be afraid of starving before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is
long and weary work, and we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables of
Elrond's house!'
The cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the edge of the dell they could see
nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow. The sky above had cleared again and
was slowly filled with twinkling stars. Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped
in every garment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single cloak, and sat a
little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.
As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales to
keep their minds from fear. He knew many histories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men and
the good and evil deeds of the Elder Days. They wondered how old he was, and where he had
learned all this lore.
'Tell us of Gil-galad,' said Merry suddenly, when he paused at the end of a story of the ElfKingdoms. 'Do you know any more of that old lay that you spoke of?'
'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo, for it concerns us closely.' Merry and Pippin
looked at Frodo, who was staring into the fire.
'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,' said Frodo slowly. 'Gil-galad was the last of the
great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is _Starlight_ in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elffriend, he went to the land of–––'
'No!' said Strider interrupting, 'I do not think that tale should be told now with the servants of the
Enemy at hand. If we win through to the house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.'
'Then tell us some other tale of the old days,' begged Sam; 'a tale about the Elves before the
fading time. I would dearly like to hear more about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.'
'I will tell you the tale of Tinúviel,' said Strider, 'in brief – for it is a long tale of which the end is
not known; and there are none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It
is a fair tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may lift up your hearts.'
He was silent for some time, and then he began not to speak but to chant softly:
The leaves were long, the grass was green,
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,

And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tinúviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.
There Beren came from mountains cold,
And lost he wandered under leaves,
And where the Elven-river rolled
He walked alone and sorrowing.
He peered between the hemlock-leaves
And saw in wander flowers of gold
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,
And her hair like shadow following.
Enchantment healed his weary feet
That over hills were doomed to roam;
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
Through woven woods in Elvenhome
She tightly fled on dancing feet,
And left him lonely still to roam
In the silent forest listening.
He heard there oft the flying sound
Of feet as light as linden-leaves,
Or music welling underground,
In hidden hollows quavering.
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,
And one by one with sighing sound
Whispering fell the beechen leaves
In the wintry woodland wavering.
He sought her ever, wandering far
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,
By light of moon and ray of star
In frosty heavens shivering.
Her mantle glinted in the moon,
As on a hill-top high and far
She danced, and at her feet was strewn
A mist of silver quivering.
When winter passed, she came again,
And her song released the sudden spring,
Like rising lark, and falling rain,
And melting water bubbling.
He saw the elven-flowers spring
About her feet, and healed again
He longed by her to dance and sing

Upon the grass untroubling.
Again she fled, but swift he came.
Tinúviel! Tinúviel!
He called her by her elvish name;
And there she halted listening.
One moment stood she, and a spell
His voice laid on her: Beren came,
And doom fell on Tinúviel
That in his arms lay glistening.
As Beren looked into her eyes
Within the shadows of her hair,
The trembling starlight of the skies
He saw there mirrored shimmering.
Tinúviel the elven-fair,
Immortal maiden elven-wise,
About him cast her shadowy hair
And arms like silver glimmering.
Long was the way that fate them bore,
O'er stony mountains cold and grey,
Through halls of iron and darkling door,
And woods of nightshade morrowless.
The Sundering Seas between them lay,
And yet at last they met once more,
And long ago they passed away
In the forest singing sorrowless.
Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again. 'That is a song,' he said, 'in the mode that is
called _ann-thennath_ among the Elves, but is hard to render in our Common Speech, and this is
but a rough echo of it. It tells of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and Lúthien Tinúviel. Beren
was a mortal man, but Lúthien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves upon Middle-earth
when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the
children of this world. As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in
her face was a shining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a
servant, dwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West coming back to Middle-earth
made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which he had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the
Elves. But the Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great peril
came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the forest of Neldoreth.
There he beheld Lúthien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and
he named her Tinúviel, that is Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them
afterwards, and they were parted long. Tinúviel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron, and
together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great Enemy from his throne,
and took from his iron crown one of the three Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price
of Lúthien to Thingol her father. Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the
gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tinúviel. But she chose mortality, and to die from the
world, so that she might follow him; and it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas,
and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, long ago,
beyond the confines of this world. So it is that Lúthien Tinúviel alone of the Elf-kindred has died

indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage
of the Elf-lords of old descended among Men. There live still those of whom Lúthien was the
foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin. For of
Beren and Lúthien was born Dior Thingol's heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Eärendil
wedded, he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the
Silmaril upon his brow. And of Eärendil came the Kings of Númenor, that is Westernesse.'
As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit in the red glow of the
wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and deep. Above him was a black starry sky.
Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was
climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top faded.
The story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. 'Look!' said Merry. 'The Moon is rising: it
must be getting late.'
The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the hill something small and
dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown
up by the pale light.
Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin remained seated in
silence. Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently. All seemed quiet and still, but
Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking. He
huddled closer to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell.
'I don't know what it is,' he said, 'but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn't go outside this dell for any
money; I felt that something was creeping up the slope.'
'Did you _see_ anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet.
'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.'
'I saw something,' said Merry; 'or I thought I did – away westwards where the moonlight was
falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hill-tops, I _thought_ there were two or three black
shapes. They seemed to be moving this way.'
'Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!' cried Strider. 'Get some of the longer sticks
ready in your hands!'
For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their backs turned to the wood-fire,
each gazing into the shadows that encircled them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or
movement in the night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out
aloud.
'Hush!' whispered Strider. 'What's that?' gasped Pippin at the same moment.
Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow
rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow.
Soon there could be no doubt:
three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black
were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he
heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly
advanced.
Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the ground. Sam shrank to
Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was
bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to
do this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget the Barrow, nor the
message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he
longed to yield. Not with the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply
felt that he must take the Ring and put it on his finger. He could not speak. He felt Sam looking at
him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble, but he could not turn towards him. He
shut his eyes and struggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly
drew out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.

Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became
terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two
standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes;
under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms of silver; in their
haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards
him. Desperate, he drew his own sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
firebrand. Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others: his hair was long and
gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a long sword, and in the other a knife;
both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down
on Frodo.
At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard himself crying aloud:
O _Elbereth! Gilthoniel!_ At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out
in the night; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he
swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped
the Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it.
_Chapter 12_
Flight to the Ford
When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately. He was lying by the
fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly. His three companions were bending over him.
'What has happened? Where is the pale king?' he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to hear
him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from
Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly to
his horror Sam found that his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past
him, and he fell. He heard Frodo's voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from
under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they stumbled over the
body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him. Strider
ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a
good while ago.
Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while they were talking he
returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood
over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.
'I am not a Black Rider, Sam,' he said gently, 'nor in league with them. I have been trying to
discover something of their movements; but I have found nothing. I cannot think why they have
gone and do not attack again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.'
When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and shook his head and
sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small
kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. 'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!' he said.
Then he got up and walked away, and called Sam to him. 'I think I understand things better now,'
he said in a low voice. 'There seem only to have been five of the enemy. Why they were not all
here, I don't know; but I don't think they expected to be resisted. They have drawn off for the time
being. But not far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They are only
waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly
much further. I fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to
their will. We shall see!' Sam choked with tears. 'Don't despair!' said Strider. 'You must trust me
now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might
prove so. He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his

enemies expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am away!' He
hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness.
Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was
spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His friends watched over him, warming him, and
bathing his wound. The night passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky, and the
dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.
'Look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden
by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there was a slash. 'This was the stroke of Frodo's
sword,' he said. 'The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades
perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth.'
'And more deadly to Frodo was this!' He stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife. There
was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the
point was broken off. But even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for
the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider's
hand. 'Alas!' he cried. 'It was this accursed knife that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in
healing to match such evil weapons. But I will do what I can.'
He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a
slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke
words the others could not catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.
'These leaves,' he said, 'I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills;
but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.' He
crushed a leaf in his fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. 'It is fortunate that I
could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middle-earth. _Athelas_
they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old;
and it is not known in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great
virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.'
He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder. The fragrance of the steam
was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also
some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his
side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his hand. He bitterly
regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in
putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He
wondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue their
journey. He fell too weak to stand.
The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to leave Weathertop as
soon as possible. 'I think now,' said Strider, 'that the enemy has been watching this place for some
days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not
return. In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, and we can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.'
As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed. It was impossible for
Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put
Frodo on the pony. In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed
fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill
Ferny's treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than
its former life.
They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the Road, but. it was the
quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be
kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his
plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east beyond
Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.

They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill, and came
in a little while to the edge of the Road. There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were
hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering.
Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The land before them
sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spaces in between. The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves
in the thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow and
gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart was grieved as he watched them
walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider
seemed tired and heavy-hearted.
Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of
it for a long time. Four days passed, without the ground or the scene changing much, except that
behind them Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer.
Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or
followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night, expecting at any
time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw
nothing, and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they feel the
sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell. It seemed too much to hope
that the Riders had already lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush
in a narrow place?
At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow
valley into which they had descended. Strider now turned their course again north-eastwards, and
on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of
wooded hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and
to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet
another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist.
"I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,' said Strider. 'We have now come to
the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the trollfells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater away in the South. Some call it the Greyflood
after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is no way over it below its sources in the
Ettenmoors, except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses.'
'What is that other river we can see far away there?' asked Merry.
'That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,' answered Strider. 'The Road runs along the edge
of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how
we shall cross that water. One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the
Last Bridge held against us.'
Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of the Road. Sam and
Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of
the hills there had been some rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed
away all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.
They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile or two they saw the Last
Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope. They dreaded to see black figures waiting there,
but they saw none. Strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went
forward to explore.
Before long he came hurrying back. 'I can see no sign of the enemy,' he said, 'and I wonder very
much what that means. But I have found something very strange.'
He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. 'I found it in the mud in the middle
of the Bridge,' he said. 'It is a beryl, an elf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I
cannot say; but it brings hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we may pass the Bridge; but beyond
that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer token.'

At once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing no sound but the water
swirling against its three great arches. A mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away
northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon they
were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills.
The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them; but this
new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As they went forward the hills about them steadily
rose. Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the
ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead
and to think. He recalled Bilbo's account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north
of the Road, in the country near the Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had happened.
Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass
near the spot.
'Who lives in this land?' he asked. 'And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?'
'No!' said Strider. 'Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land. Men once dwelt here, ages ago;
but none remain now. They became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of
Angmar. But all were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end. But that is
now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies on the land.'
'Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forgetful?' asked Peregrin. 'The birds
and beasts do not tell tales of that son.'
'The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,' said Strider; 'and many more things than I can
tell are remembered in Rivendell.' 'Have you often been to Rivendell?' said Frodo. 'I have,' said
Strider. 'I dwelt there once, and still I return when I may.
There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the fair house of Elrond.'
The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen, but
both were now hidden from view. The travellers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven,
dark and silent. Trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into
mounting slopes of pine-wood.
The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way through a
pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks. As long as they could they
avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the
narrow dales. They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind
began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of
the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for
they could not get any fire to burn. The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them,
and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course. Strider seemed to be getting
anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was
beginning to run low. It went on raining.
That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a
shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. Frodo was restless. The cold and wet had made his wound
more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing
and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock, water
dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes were
advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting
hunched up, smoking his pipe, and watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream,
in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear
than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge.
In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds were still thick, but they
were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared between them. The wind was shifting again. They
did not start early. Immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone,

telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he came back. He was going to climb
up, if he could, and get a look at the lie of the land.
When he returned he was not reassuring. 'We have come too far to the north,' he said, 'and we
must find some way to turn back southwards again. If we keep on as we are going we shall get up
into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell. That is troll-country, and little known to me. We could
perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but it would take too
long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not last. So somehow or other we must find
the Ford of Bruinen.'
The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They found a passage between
two hills that led them into a valley running south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but
towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge
against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw. They had a choice
between going back or climbing over it.
They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before long Frodo was obliged
to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or
indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they
were all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a narrow saddle
between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo
threw himself down, and lay on the ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and
shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy
and dim.
'We cannot go any further,' said Merry to Strider. 'I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo.
I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him
in Rivendell, if we ever get there?'
'We shall see,' answered Strider. 'There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness; and it is
chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further
tonight.'
'What is the matter with my master?' asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider.
'His wound was small, and it is already closed. There's nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on
his shoulder.'
'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,' said Strider, 'and there is some poison or
evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out. But do not give up hope, Sam!'
Night was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old
pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as if stone had once been quarried there. They sat
huddled together. The wind blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down
moaning and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping
by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills.
The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light pale and clear in a rainwashed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but (hey longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff
limbs. As soon as it was light, Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the
height to the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with
more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the right direction. If they went on,
down the further side of the ridge, they would have the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead
Strider had caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from
view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to them.
'We must make for the Road again,' he said. 'We cannot hope to find a path through these hills.
Whatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only way to the Ford.'
As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down the southern side of the
ridge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this
side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an

unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The
spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again
a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.
Pippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and called to them. 'There is a
path here!' he cried.
When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake:
there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many windings out of the woods
below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked
with fallen stones and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. It was a path made
by strong arms and heavy feet. Here and there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large
rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way.
They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest way down, but they went
cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer
and broader. Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned
sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill. When they came to the comer
they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff
overhung with trees. In the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great
hinge.
Outside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber behind, but in the gloom
inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam, and Merry pushing with all their strength managed to
open the door a little wider, and then Strider and Merry went in. They did not go far, for on the
floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great
empty jars and broken pots.
'Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!' said Pippin. 'Come out, you two, and let us get
away. Now we know who made the path -and we had better get off it quick.'
'There is no need, I think,' said Strider, coining out. 'It is certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to
have been long forsaken. I don't think we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we
shall see.'
The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again across the level space
plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went
on ahead with Merry. Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo's pony, for the path
was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone very far
before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both looked terrified.
'There _are_ trolls!' Pippin panted. 'Down in a clearing in the woods not far below. We got a
sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very large!'
'We will come and look at them,' said Strider, picking up a stick. Frodo said nothing, but Sam
looked scared.
The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped branches of the trees, and lit
the clearing with bright patches of light. They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the
tree-trunks, holding their breath. There stood the trolls: three large trolls. One was stooping, and the
other two stood staring at him.
Strider walked forward unconcernedly. 'Get up, old stone!' he said, and broke his stick upon the
stooping troll.
Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even Frodo
laughed. 'Well!' he said. 'We are forgetting our family history! These must be the very three that
were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.'
'I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!' said Pippin. He knew the story well. Bilbo and
Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it. Even now he
looked at the stone trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them
to life again.

'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls,' said Strider.
'It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live
trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old
bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!'
They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of Bilbo's first successful
adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was warm and comforting, and the mist before his eyes
seemed to be lifting a little. They rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal
right under the shadow of the trolls' large legs.
'Won't somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?' said Merry, when they had
finished. 'We haven't had a song or a tale for days.'
'Not since Weathertop,' said Frodo. The others looked at him. 'Don't worry about me!' he added.
'I feel much better, but I don't think I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his
memory.'
'Come on, Sam!' said Merry. 'There's more stored in your head than you let on about.'
'I don't know about that,' said Sam. 'But how would this suit? It ain't what I call proper poetry, if
you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But these old images here brought it to my mind.'
Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune.
Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,
And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;
For many a year he had gnawed it near,
For meat was hard to come by.
Done by! Gum by!
In a case in the hills he dwelt alone,
And meat was hard to come by.
Up came Tom with his big boots on.
Said he to Troll: 'Pray, what is yon?
For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim,
As should be a-lyin' in graveyard.
Caveyard! Paveyard!
This many a year has Tim been gone,
And I thought he were lyin' in graveyard.'
'My lad,' said Troll, 'this bone I stole.
But what be bones that lie in a hole?
Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead,
Afore I found his shinbone.
Tinbone! Thinbone!
He can spare a share for a poor old troll,
For he don't need his shinbone.'
Said Tom: 'I don't see why the likes o' thee
Without axin' leave should go makin' free
With the shank or the shin o' my father's kin;
So hand the old bone over!
Rover! Trover!
Though dead he be, it belongs to he;
So hand the old bone over!'

'For a couple o' pins,' says Troll, and grins,
'I'll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.
A bit o' fresh meal will go down sweet!
I'll try my teeth on thee now.
Hee now! See now!
I'm tired o' gnawing old bones and skins;
I've a mind to dine on thee now.'
But just as he thought his dinner was caught,
He found his hands had hold of naught.
Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind
And gave him the boot to larn him.
Warn him! Darn him!
A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thought,
Would be the way to larn him.
But harder than stone is the flesh and bone
Of a troll that sits in the hills alone.
As well set your boot to the mountain's root,
For the seat of a troll don't feel it.
Peel it! Heal it!
Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,
And he knew his toes could feel it.
Tom's leg is game, since home he came,
And his bootless foot is lasting lame;
But Troll don't care, and he's still there
With the bone he boned from its owner.
Doner! Boner!
Troll's old seat is still the same,
And the bone he boned from its owner!
'Well, that's a warning to us all!' laughed Merry. 'It is as well you used a stick, and not your
hand, Strider!'
'Where did you come by that, Sam?' asked Pippin. 'I've never heard those words before.'
Sam muttered something inaudible. 'It's out of his own head, of course,' said Frodo. 'I am
learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. First he was a conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll
end up by becoming a wizard – or a warrior!'
'I hope not,' said Sam. 'I don't want to be neither!'
In the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were probably following the very track
that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before. After a few miles they came out
on the top of a high bank above the Road. At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in
its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather-covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains. Not far down the bank
Strider pointed out a stone in the grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be
seen dwarf-runes and secret marks.
'There!' said Merry. 'That must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls' gold was
hidden. How much is left of Bilbo's share, I wonder, Frodo?'

Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous,
nor less easy to pan with. 'None at all,' he said. 'Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it
was really his, as it came from robbers.'
The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was no sign of any other
travellers to be seen. As there was now no other possible course for them to take, they climbed
down the bank, and turning left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off
the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains
ahead.
They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they could camp for the night,
when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind
them. They looked back, but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of
the Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather
and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing
hazels. As they peered out from among the bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the
failing light, some thirty feel below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going fast,
with a light _clippety-clippely-clip._ Then faintly, as if it was blown away from them by the
breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of small bells tinkling.
'That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!' said Frodo, listening intently. The other hobbits
agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of
pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was
now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a look of joy on his face.
The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer and nearer now the bells
jingled, and _clippety-clip_ came the quick trotting feet. Suddenly into view below came a white
horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if
it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood
was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared
that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.
Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping with a cry through the
heather; but even before he had moved or called, the rider had reined in his horse and halted,
looking up towards the thicket where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to
meet him calling out: _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ His speech and clear ringing voice
left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No others that dwelt in the wide world
had voices so fair to hear. But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw
that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider.
Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the Road.
'This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of Elrond,' said Strider.
'Hail, and well met at last!' said the Elf-lord to Frodo. 'I was sent from Rivendell to look for you.
We feared that you were in danger upon the road.'
'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?' cried Frodo joyfully.
'No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,' answered Glorfindel. 'Elrond
received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the
Baranduin, learned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said
that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for
Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine;
but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn
far aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.
'It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel, and left a token there,
nigh on seven days ago. Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew
and I pursued them westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward. Since

then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and followed it over the Bridge; and
today I marked where you descended from the hills again. But come! There is no time for further
news. Since you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and
when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind. And they are not all.
Where the other four may be, I do not know. I fear that we may find the Ford is already held
against us.'
While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened. Frodo felt a great weariness
come over him. Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt
that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he
felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm.
'My master is sick and wounded,' said Sam angrily. 'He can't go on riding after nightfall. He
needs rest.'
Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms he looked in
his face with grave anxiety.
Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and of the deadly knife. He
drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it,
but he looked intently at it.
'There are evil things written on this hilt,' he said; 'though maybe your eyes cannot see them.
Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may!
Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can – but all the more
do I urge you now to go on without rest.'
He searched the wound on Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver, as if what
he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept
down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed to grow
lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his friends' faces more clearly again,
and a measure of new hope and strength returned.
'You shall ride my horse,' said Glorfindel. 'I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle-skins, and
you must sit as tight as you can. But you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I
command him to bear. His pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he will bear
you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival.'
'No, he will not!' said Frodo. 'I shall not ride him, if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or
anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in danger.'
Glorfindel smiled. 'I doubt very much,' he said, 'if your friends would be in danger if you were
not with them! The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and
that which you bear that brings us all in peril.'
To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel's white horse. The
pony was laden instead with a great part of the others' burdens, so that they now marched lighter,
and for a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift
tireless feet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on under the deep
clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to
halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even
Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream.
They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road-side, and fell asleep
immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself
to watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the morning, and
the clouds and mists of the night were gone.
'Drink this!' said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silverstudded flask of leather. It was clear as spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool
or warm in the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it.

Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit (which was now all that they had left)
seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.
They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road again. Glorfindel still
urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts during the day's march. In this way they covered
almost twenty miles before nightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down
towards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So far there had been no
sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and
listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he
spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.
But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that
night. They were stumbling along dizzy with weariness, and unable to think of anything but their
feet and legs. Frodo's pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of
ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world seemed less pale and
empty.
The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning. There were many
miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could
manage.
'Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,' said Glorfindel; 'for my heart warns me
that the pursuit is now swift behind us, and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.'
The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in places much grass at either
side, in which the hobbits walked when they could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they
came to a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and then
plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes ran along as they hurried
forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own. All at once, as if
through a gate of light, the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at the
bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and beyond that the Ford of
Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that
the tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.
There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a
wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and
listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.
'Fly!' he called. 'Fly! The enemy is upon us!'
The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. Glorfindel and Strider
followed as rear-guard. They were only half way across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise
of horses galloping. Out of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined
his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and then another; then again
two more.
'Ride forward! Ride!' cried Glorfindel to Frodo.
He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking the horse to a walk, he
turned and looked back. The Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues
upon a hill, dark and solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist.
Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait. Then at once fear
and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red
flash he drew it.
'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elftongue: _noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!_
At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road. At
the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a
terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away. It
was answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the

left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo: two galloped madly towards the Ford
to cut off his escape. They seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and
darker, as their courses converged with his.
Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer see his friends. The
Riders behind were falling back: even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elfhorse of Glorfindel. He looked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed no chance of reaching
the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could see them clearly
now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in white
and grey. Swords were naked in their pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes
glittered, and they called to him with fell voices.
Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No cry came from him. He
shut his eyes and clung to the horse's mane. The wind whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the
harness rang wild and shrill. A breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt,
like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right before the face of the
foremost Rider.
Frodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the quick heave and surge as
the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was
across the Ford.
But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about
neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at the water's edge below, and Frodo's spirit quailed
before the threat of their uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path
from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was
commanded urgently to halt. Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to
refuse.
Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at the water and reared up.
With a great effort Frodo sat upright and brandished his sword.
'Go back!' he cried. 'Go back to the Land of Mordor, and follow me no more! ' His voice
sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The Riders halted, but Frodo had not the power of
Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter. 'Come back! Come
back!' they called. 'To Mordor we will take you!'
'Go back!' he whispered.
'The Ring! The Ring!' they cried with deadly voices; and immediately their leader urged his
horse forward into the water, followed closely by two others.
'By Elbereth and Lúthien the Fair,' said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, 'you shall
have neither the Ring nor me!'
Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in his stirrups, and raised
up his hand. Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart
labouring. His sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The
foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore.
At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud waters rolling many stones.
Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry
of waves. White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw
amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three Riders that were still
in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam.
Those that were behind drew back in dismay.
With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him that he saw, beyond the
Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy
forms waving flames, that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world.

The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders
into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried
them away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and
engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more.

_Chapter 1_
Many Meetings
Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long
unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the
ceiling looked strange; it was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer
looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a waterfall.
`Where am I, and what is the time?' he said aloud to the ceiling. 'In the House of Elrond, and it is
ten o'clock in the morning.' said a voice. `It is the morning of October the twenty-fourth, if you
want to know.'
`Gandalf!' cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting in a chair by the open
window.
`Yes,' he said, `I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after all the absurd things you have
done since you left home.' Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue,
and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now,
and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous `short cut' through the Old Forest the
`accident' at _The Prancing Pony_; and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under
Weathertop. While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down
to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's
pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.
'Where's Sam?' Frodo asked at length. 'And are the others all right?'
'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf. `Sam was here until I sent him off to get
some rest, about half an hour ago.'
`What happened at the Ford?' said Frodo. `It all seemed so dim somehow; and it still does.'
'Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,' answered Gandalf. 'The wound was overcoming
you at last. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some
strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you showed in the Barrow. That was touch and go: perhaps the
most dangerous moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.'
'You seem to know a great deal already,' said Frodo. `I have not spoken to the others about the
Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards there were other things to think about. How do
you know about it?'
'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and it has not been hard for me
to read your mind and memory. Do not worry! Though I said "absurd" just now, I did not mean it. I
think well of you-and of the others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such
dangers, still bearing the Ring.'
'We should never have done it without Strider,' said Frodo. `But we needed you. I did not know
what to do without you.'
'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, `and that nearly proved our ruin. And yet I am not sure; it may
have been better so.'
'I wish you would tell me what happened!'
'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today, by Elrond's
orders.'

`But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as tiring,' said Frodo. 'I am
wide awake now, and I remember so many things that want explaining. Why were you delayed?
You ought to tell me that at least.'
'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf. 'We shall have a Council, as soon as
you are well enough. At the moment I will only say that I was held captive.'
'You?' cried Frodo.
'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,' said the wizard solemnly. 'There are many powers in the world, for
good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. Against some I have not yet been measured. But my
time is coming. The Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!'
`Then you knew of the Riders already-before I met them?'
'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black Riders are the
Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. But I did not know that they had arisen
again or I should have fled with you at once. I heard news of them only after I left you in June; but
that story must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.'
'Yes,' said Frodo, `it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of him at first. Sam never quite
trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we met Glorfindel.'
Gandalf smiled. `I have heard all about Sam,' he said. 'He has no more doubts now.'
'I am glad,' said Frodo. 'For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, _fond_ is not the right
word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often
of you. I didn't know that any of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just
big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked like Bill Ferny. But then
we don't know much about Men in the Shire, except perhaps the Breelanders.'
`You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,' said Gandalf. 'He
is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through
a brick wall in time (as they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son of
Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It may be that this War of the
Ring will be their last adventure.'
'Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old Kings?' said Frodo in wonder. `I
thought they had all vanished long ago. I thought he was only a Ranger.'
'Only a Ranger!' cried Gandalf. `My dear Frodo, that is just what the Rangers are: the last
remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of the West. They have helped me before; and I
shall need their help in the days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at
rest.'
'I suppose not,' said Frodo. 'But so far my only thought has been to get here; and I hope I shan't
have to go any further. It is very pleasant just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure,
and I find that has been as much as I want.'
He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. 'I have been reckoning,' he said,
`and I can't bring the total up to October the twenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must
have reached the Ford by the twentieth.'
'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf. `How do the side and
shoulder feel now?'
'I don't know.' Frodo answered. 'They don't feel at all: which is an improvement, but'-he made an
effort-'I can move my arm again a little. Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,' he added,
touching his left hand with his right.
`Good!' said Gandalf. `It is mending fast. You will soon be sound again. Elrond has cured you:
he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in.'
'Days?' said Frodo.
`Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you from this where you lost
count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has hardly left your side, day or night, except to run
messages. Elrond is a master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the

truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the
closed wound. But it could not be found until last night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was
deeply buried. and it was working inwards.'
Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider's
hands. `Don't be alarmed!' said Gandalf. `It is gone now. It has been melted. And it seems that
Hobbits fade very reluctantly. I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would quickly
have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen days.'
`What would they have done to me?' asked Frodo. `What were the Riders trying to do?'
'They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in the wound. If they had
succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker and under their command. You
would have became a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord; and he would have tormented
you for trying to keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and
seeing it on his hand.'
'Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!' said Frodo faintly. I was mortally afraid,
of course; but if I had known more, I should not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I
escaped!'
'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, `not to mention courage. For your heart was
not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; and that was because you resisted to the last. But
it was a terribly narrow shave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for
then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized you. You could see
them, and they could see you.'
`I know,' said Frodo. `They were terrible to behold! But why could we all see their horses?'
`Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape
to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living.'
`Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals are terrified when they
draw near, even the elf-horse of Glorfindel. The dogs howl and the geese scream at them.'
`Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor. Not all his
servants and chattels are wraiths! There are orcs and trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and
there have been and still are many Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet
are under his sway. And their number is growing daily.'
`What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?'
`Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the Dark Lord, and they may fly
before him, but never again will they listen to him or serve him. And here in Rivendell there live
still some of his chief foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They
do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both
worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power.'
'I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others. Was that
Glorfindel then?'
'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the mighty of the Firstborn.
He is an Elf-lord of a house of princes. Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might
of Mordor, for a while: and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind
in the Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if things go on as they are
going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength.
`Still,' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin. while his beard went stiff and
straight like bristling wire, `we must keep up our courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk
you to death. You are in Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.'
'I haven't any courage to keep up,' said Frodo, `but I am not worried at the moment. Just give me
news of my friends, and tell me the end of the affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be
content for the present. After that I shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan't be able to close my
eyes until you have finished the story for me.'

Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo. The colour had come
back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully awake and aware. He was smiling, and there
seemed to be little wrong with him. But to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as it
were of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the
coverlet.
`Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. `He is not half through yet, and to what he
will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass
filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can.'
`You look splendid,' he said aloud. `I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond. But quite
brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again. This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The
Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses
any longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of their world. And also
the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have been ridden down.
They knew that nothing could save you, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to
overtake, and too many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not with
stand all the Nine at once.
`When the Ringwraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to the Ford there is a small
hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for
Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have
to deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood appeared, he rushed
out, followed by Aragorn and the. others with flaming brands. Caught between fire and water, and
seeing an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with
madness. Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were now hurled into
the water by their horses and overwhelmed.'
'And is that the end of the Black Riders?' asked Frodo.
'No,' said Gandalf. 'Their horses must have perished, and without them they are crippled. But the
Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from
them at present. Your friends crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your
face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was standing guard beside
you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you were dead, or worse. Elrond's folk met them,
carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.'
`Who made the flood?' asked Frodo.
'Elrond commanded it,' answered Gandalf. `The river of this valley is under his power, and it
will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the Ford. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths
rode into the water the flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you
may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining
white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we
had let loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There
is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains.'
`Yes, it all comes back to me now,' said Frodo: 'the tremendous roaring. I thought I was
drowning, with my friends and enemies and all. But now we are safe!'
Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. 'Yes, you are all safe for the present.
Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and
you will all be there in places of honour.'
'Splendid!' said Frodo. `It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel and such great lords, not to
mention Strider, should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness.'
`Well, there are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling. `I am one good reason.
The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer. And you are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.'

`Dear Bilbo!' said Frodo sleepily. `I wonder where he is. I wish he was here and could hear all
about it. It would have made him laugh, The cow jumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!'
With that he fell fast asleep.
Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house was, as Bilbo had
long ago reported, `a perfect house, whether you like food or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or
just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all'. Merely to be there was a cure for
weariness, fear, and sadness.
As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest
or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards.
He got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had
been. He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently. Looking in a
mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked
remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire;
but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.
`Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking-glass,' he said to his
reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!'
He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.
At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran to Frodo and took his
left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away.
`Hullo, Sam!' said Frodo.
`It's warm!' said Sam. `Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through the long
nights. But glory and trumpets!' he cried, turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the
floor. 'It's fine to see you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.'
'I am ready,' said Frodo. 'Let's go and look for the rest of the party!'
`I can take you to them, sir,' said Sam. `It's a big house this, and very peculiar. Always a bit
more to discover, and no knowing what you'll find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and
Elves there! Some like kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children. And the music
and the singing-not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here. But
I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.'
'I know what you have been doing, Sam,' said Frodo, taking his arm. 'But you shall be merry
tonight, and listen to your heart's content. Come on, guide me round the corners!'
Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the
steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east.
Shadows had fallen in the valley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far
above. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling water was loud, and the evening was
filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.
`Hurray!' cried Pippin, springing up. `Here is our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord of the
Ring!'
'Hush!' said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. `Evil things do not come into
this valley; but all the same we should not name them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the
master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world! We are
sitting in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.'
`Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin. `He thinks I need keeping
in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could
sing, if I knew the right song for the occasion.'
`I feel like singing myself,' laughed Frodo. `Though at the moment I feel more like eating and
drinking!'

`That will soon be cured,' said Pippin. `You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in
time for a meal.'
`More than meal! A feast!' said Merry. `As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered,
the preparations began.' He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by
the ringing of many bells.
The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few
guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon
the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.
Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales
spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he
thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in
stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad
shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great
snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire.
Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless
and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom,
and in his hand was strength.
The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of
many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was
set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of
stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in
the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.
In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a
canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond
that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids
of her dark hair were touched by no frost, her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth,
and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and
thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years
bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems,
glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver.
So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in
whom it was said that the likeness of Lúthien had come on earth again; and she was called
Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's
kin, in Lórien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father's house.
But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry: for they rode often far afield with the
Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.
Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; and he
was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at Elrond's table among all these folk so
high and fair. Though he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very
small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. The feast was merry and the food all
that his hunger could desire. It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to
his neighbours.
He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master, but had
been told that for this time he was a guest of honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin
and Merry at the upper end of one of the side-tables close to the dais. He could see no sign of
Strider.
Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, very
long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a

silver belt, and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at
him.
'Welcome and well met!' said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he actually rose from his
seat and bowed. `Glóin at your service,' he said, and bowed still lower.
'Frodo Baggins at your service and your family's,' said Frodo correctly, rising in surprise and
scattering his cushions. 'Am I right in guessing that you are _the_ Glóin, one of the twelve
companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield?'
`Quite right,' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo
back into his seat. 'And I do not ask, for I have already been told that you are the kinsman and
adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.'
`Thank you very much,' said Frodo.
'You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,' said Glóin. 'I wonder greatly what brings
_four_ hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But
perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of
this?'
'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said Frodo politely.
He guessed that even in Elrond's house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk; and in
any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time. 'But I am equally curious,' he added, `to learn
what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.'
Glóin looked at him. 'If you have not heard, I think we will not speak yet of that either. Master
Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, and then we shall all hear many things. But there is
much else that may be told.'
Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo listened more than he spoke; for
the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while
Glóin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland. Frodo learned that
Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their land between
the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.
'lndeed,' said Glóin, `if it were not for the Beornings, the passage from Dale to Rivendell would
long ago have become impossible. They are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford
of Carrock. But their tolls are high,' he added with a shake of his head; `and like Beorn of old they
are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much in these days. Nowhere are
there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson
of Bard the Bowman rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his realm
now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.'
'And what of your own people?' asked Frodo.
`There is much to tell, good and bad,' said Glóin; 'yet it is mostly good: we have so far been
fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of these times. If you really wish to hear of us, I
will tell you tidings gladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves' tongues run on when
speaking of their handiwork, they say.'
And with that Glóin embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarf-kingdom. He was
delighted to have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no
attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of
people and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to hear that Dáin
was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having passed his two hundred and fiftieth
year), venerable, and fabulously rich. Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five
Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Glóin, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur
was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table, and it took six
young dwarves to lift him.
'And what has become of Balin and Ori and Óin?' asked Frodo.

A shadow passed over Glóin's face. `We do not know,' he answered. 'It is largely on account of
Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of
merrier things!'
Glóin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo about their great labours in
Dale and under the Mountain. 'We have done well,' he said. `But in metalwork we cannot rival our
fathers, many of whose. secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot
again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came. Only in mining
and building have we surpassed the old days. You should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the
fountains, and the pools! You should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and
cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the terraces and towers upon the
Mountain's sides! Then you would see that we have not been idle.'
'I will come and see them, if ever I can,' said Frodo. 'How surprised Bilbo would have been to
see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!'
Glóin looked at Frodo and smiled. 'You were very fond of Bilbo were you not?' he asked.
`Yes,' answered Frodo. 'I would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world.'
At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall, and the
company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown open, and they went across a wide
passage and through other doors, and came into a further hall. In it were no tables, but a bright fire
was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side.
Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. `This is the Hall of Fire' said the wizard. `Here you
will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep awake. But except on high days it usually stands
empty and quiet, and people come here who wish for peace, and thought. There is always a fire
here, all the year round, but there is little other light.'
As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish minstrels began to make
sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that
were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair.
Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure seated on a stool
with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the ground was a drinking-cup and some
bread. Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been
unable to come to the feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark
cloak was drawn over his face.
Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. 'Awake little master. he said, with a
smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him. 'Now at last the hour has come that you have
wished for, Frodo,' he said. `Here is a friend that you have long missed.'
The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face.
`Bilbo!' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.
`Hullo, Frodo my lad!' said Bilbo. `So you have got here at last. I hoped you would manage it.
Well, well! So all this feasting is in your honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?'
'Why weren't you there?' cried Frodo. `And why haven't I been allowed to see you before?'
`Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by your side with Sam each
day. But as for the feast` I don't go in for such things much now. And I had something else to do.'
`What were you doing?'
`Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is the best place to do it in, as a
rule. Wake up, indeed!' he said, cocking an eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no
sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see. `Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want to
know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you have disturbed me-in the middle of
making up a song. I was stuck over a line or two, and was thinking about them; but now I don't
suppose I shall ever get them right. There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven
clean out of my head. I shall have to get my friend the Dúnadan to help me. Where is he?'

Elrond laughed. `He shall be found,' he said. `Then you two shall go into a corner and finish
your task, and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent
to find Bilbo's friend, though none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast.
In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself
near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about
them. Bilbo had not much to say of himself. When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off
aimlessly, along the Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the time
towards Rivendell. `I got here without much adventure,' he said, `and after a rest I went on with the
dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan't travel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back
here, and here I have been. I have done this and that. I have written some more of my book. And, of
course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to please me, I think; for, of
course, they aren't really good enough for Rivendell. And I listen and I think. Time doesn't seem to
pass here: it just is. A remarkable place altogether.
`I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the South, but hardly anything
from the Shire. I heard about the Ring, of course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told
me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these last few years. The Dúnadan has told me
more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out
more sooner. I could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble. I have
thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let
me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low
for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught me tottering about in the Wild.
'And Gandalf said: "The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good to you or to others, if
you tried to meddle with it again." Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was
looking after you, so I let things be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.' He paused and
looked at Frodo doubtfully.
`Have you got it here?' he asked in a whisper. `I can't help feeling curious, you know, after all
I've heard. I should very much like just to peep at it again.'
`Yes, I've got it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. `It looks just the same as ever it
did.'
`Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo.
When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on
a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew
back the Ring. To his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a
shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little
wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him.
The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at
Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. `I understand now,' he said. `Put it away! I am
sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden: sorry about everything. Don't adventures ever have
an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't be helped. I
wonder if it's any good trying to finish my book? But don't let's worry about it now-let's have some
real News! Tell me all about the Shire!'
Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory. The light
and music of Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo smiled and laughed happily. Every item of
news from the Shire that Frodo could tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the
greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in
Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that they did not notice the arrival
of a man clad in dark green cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.
Suddenly Bilbo looked up. 'Ah, there you are at last, Dúnadan!' he cried.
`Strider!' said Frodo. `You seem to have a lot of names.'

`Well, _Strider_ is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,' said Bilbo. `What do you call him
that for?'
`They call me that in Bree,' said Strider laughing, 'and that is how I was introduced to him.'
`And why do you call him Dúnadan?' asked Frodo.
`_The_ Dúnadan,' said Bilbo. `He is often called that here. But I thought you knew enough
Elvish at least to know _dún-udan_: Man of the West, Númenorean. But this is not the time for
lessons!' He turned to Strider.
`Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at the feast? The Lady Arwen was there.'
Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. `I know,' he said. 'But often I must put mirth aside.
Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished
to hear at once.'
`Well, my dear fellow,' said Bilbo, `now you've heard the news, can't you spare me a moment? I
want your help in something urgent. Elrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end
of the evening, and I am stuck. Let's go off into a corner and polish it up!'
Strider smiled. `Come then!' he said. `Let me hear it!'
Frodo was left to himself for a while. for Sam had fallen asleep. He was alone and felt rather
forlorn` although all about him the folk of Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent,
intent upon the music of the voices and the instruments. and they gave no heed to anything else.
Frodo began to listen.
At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though
he understood them little` held him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it
seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet
imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam
that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and more
dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too
multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and
it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep.
There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly
into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran
the words.
Eärendil was a mariner
that tarried in Arvernien;
he built a boat of timber felled
in Nimbrethil to journey in;
her sails he wove of silver fair,
of silver were her lanterns made,
her prow was fashioned like a swan,
and light upon her banners laid.
In panoply of ancient kings,
in chainéd rings he armoured him;
his shining shield was scored with runes
to ward all wounds and harm from him;
his bow was made of dragon-horn,
his arrows shorn of ebony,
of silver was his habergeon,
his scabbard of chalcedony;
his sword of steel was valiant,

of adamant his helmet tall,
an eagle-plume upon his crest,
upon his breast an emerald.
Beneath the Moon and under star
he wandered far from northern strands,
bewildered on enchanted ways
beyond the days of mortal lands.
From gnashing of the Narrow Ice
where shadow lies on frozen hills,
from nether heats and burning waste
he turned in haste, and roving still
on starless waters far astray
at last he came to Night of Naught,
and passed, and never sight he saw
of shining shore nor light he sought.
The winds of wrath came driving him,
and blindly in the foam he fled
from west to east and errandless,
unheralded he homeward sped.
There flying Elwing came to him,
and flame was in the darkness lit;
more bright than light of diamond
the fire upon her carcanet.
The Silmaril she bound on him
and crowned him with the living light
and dauntless then with burning brow
he turned his prow; and in the night
from Otherworld beyond the Sea
there strong and free a storm arose,
a wind of power in Tarmenel;
by paths that seldom mortal goes
his boat it bore with biting breath
as might of death across the grey
and long-forsaken seas distressed:
from east to west he passed away.
Through Evernight he back was borne
on black and roaring waves that ran
o'er leagues unlit and foundered shores
that drowned before the Days began,
until he heard on strands of pearl
when ends the world the music long,
where ever foaming billows roll
the yellow gold and jewels wan.
He saw the Mountain silent rise
where twilight lies upon the knees
of Valinor, and Eldamar

beheld afar beyond the seas.
A wanderer escaped from night
to haven white he came at last,
to Elvenhome the green and fair
where keen the air, where pale as glass
beneath the Hill of Ilmarin
a-glimmer in a valley sheer
the lamplit towers of Tirion
are mirrored on the Shadowmere.
He tarried there from errantry,
and melodies they taught to him,
and sages old him marvels told,
and harps of gold they brought to him.
They clothed him then in elven-white,
and seven lights before him sent,
as through the Calacirian
to hidden land forlorn he went.
He came unto the timeless halls
where shining fall the countless years,
and endless reigns theElder King
in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer;
and words unheard were spoken then
of folk of Men and Elven-kin,
beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those that dwell therein.
A ship then new they built for him
of mithril and of elven-glass
with shining prow; no shaven oar
nor sail she bore on silver mast:
the Silmaril as lantern light
and banner bright with living flame
to gleam thereon by Elbereth
herself was set, who thither came
and wings immortal made for him,
and laid on him undying doom,
to sail the shoreless skies and come
behind the Sun and light of Moon.
From Evereven's lofty hills
where softly silver fountains fall
his wings him bore, a wandering light,
beyond the mighty Mountain Wall.
From World's End then he turned away
and yearned again to find afar
his home through shadows journeying,
and burning as an island star
on high above the mists he came,
a distant flame before the Sun,

a wonder ere the waking dawn
where grey the Norland waters run.
And over Middle-earth he passed
and heard at last the weeping sore
of women and of elven-maids
in Elder Days, in years of yore.
gut on him mighty doom was laid,
till Moon should fade, an orbéd star
to pass, and tarry never more
on Hither Shores where mortals are;
for ever still a herald on
an errand that should never rest
to bear his shining lamp afar,
the Flammifer of Westernesse.
The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was seated on his stool in a
circle of listeners, who were smiling and applauding.
`Now we had better have it again,' said an Elf.
Bilbo got up and bowed. `I am flattered, Lindir,' he said. 'But it would be too tiring to repeat it
all.'
'Not too tiring for you,' the Elves answered laughing. 'You know you are never tired of reciting
your own verses. But really we cannot answer your question at one hearing!'
`What!' cried Bilbo. 'You can't tell which parts were mine, and which were the Dúnadan's?'
'It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals' said the Elf.
'Nonsense, Lindir,' snorted Bilbo. 'If you can't distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit, your
judgement is poorer than I imagined. They're as different as peas and apples.'
'Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,' laughed Lindir. `Or to shepherds. But
Mortals have not been our study. We have other business.'
'I won't argue with you,' said Bilbo. 'I am sleepy after so much music and singing. I'll leave you
to guess, if you want to.'
He got up and came towards Frodo. 'Well, that's over,' he said in a low voice. `It went off better
than I expected. I don't often get asked for a second hearing. What did you think of it?'
`I am not going to try and guess,' said Frodo smiling.
`You needn't,' said Bilbo. `As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except that Aragorn insisted on
my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it important. I don't know why. Otherwise he
obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make
verses about Eärendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was right.'
'I don't know,' said Frodo. `It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half
asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about. I
didn't understand that it was really you speaking until near the end.'
`It _is_ difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;' said Bilbo. 'Not that hobbits would
ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as
much as food, or more. They will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off
for some more quiet talk?'
`Can we?' said Frodo.
`Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like, as long as you don't
make a noise.'

They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. Sam they left
behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In spite of his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo
felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a
single clear voice rose in song.
A Elbereth Gilthoniel,
silivren penna míriel
o menel aglar elenath!
Na-chaered palan-díriel
o galadhremmin ennorath,
Fanuilos, le linnathon
nef aear, sí nef aearon!
Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and the fire was on his face
like summer-light upon the trees. Near him sat the Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that
Aragorn stood beside her; his dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail,
and a star shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo that
Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart.
He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of
blended word and melody. `It is a song to Elbereth,' said Bilbo. `They will sing that, and other
songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come on!'
He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens and looked south across
the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some while, looking through the window at the bright
stars above the steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small news of
the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them, but of the fair things
they had seen in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the
bright year in the woods.
At last there came a knock on the door. `Begging your pardon,' said Sam, putting in his head,
`but I was just wondering if you would be wanting anything.'
`And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,' replied Bilbo. `I guess you mean that it is time your master
went to bed.'
`Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear and he only got up today for the first time.'
`Quite right, Sam,' laughed Bilbo. `You can trot off and tell Gandalf that he has gone to bed.
Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good to see you again! There are no folk like hobbits
after all for a real good talk. I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to see
your chapters of our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I think, and look at the stars of Elbereth in
the garden. Sleep well!'
_Chapter 2_
The Council of Elrond
Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along the terraces above the
loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun rise above the far mountains, and shine down.
Slanting through the thin silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the
woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing. but
sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the
East. The snow was white upon their peaks.

On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in
talk. `Hullo! Good morning!' said Bilbo. `Feel ready for the great council?'
`I feel ready for anything,' answered Frodo. `But most of all I should like to go walking today
and explore the valley. I should like to get into those pine-woods up there.' He pointed away far up
the side of Rivendell to the north.
'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf. `But we cannot make any plans yet. There is much
to hear and decide today.'
Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. `That is the warning bell for the
Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf. `Come along now! Both you and Bilbo are wanted.'
Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house; behind
them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted Sam.
Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before. The light
of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up
from the foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo
his dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed
only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered
were grave.
Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. Frodo saw Glorfindel and
Glóin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond
drew Frodo to a seat by his side, and presented him to the company, saying:
'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come hither through greater
peril or on an errand more urgent.'
He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before. There was a younger
dwarf at Glóin's side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of
Elrond's household, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey
Havens who had come on an errand from Círdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad
in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, the King of the Elves of
Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired
and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.
He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed though his garments
were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar of
silver in which a single white stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric
he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo and
Bilbo with sudden wonder.
`Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man from the South. He arrived in the
grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be
answered.'
Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told. Much was said of events
in the world outside, especially in the South, and in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these
things Frodo had already heard many rumours; but the tale of Glóin was new to him, and when the
dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the
hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled.
`It is now many years ago,' said Glóin, `that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people. Whence
it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to be whispered in secret: it was said that we were
hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world.
Some spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazaddûm; and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return.'
Glóin sighed. `Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we delved there, and
woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled.
But now we spoke of it again with longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the

doors of Khazad-dûm for many lives of kings, save Thrór only, and he perished. At last, however,
Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though Dáin did not give leave willingly, he
took with him Ori and Óin and many of our folk, and they went away south.
"That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it seemed good: messages
reported that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there. Then there was silence, and no
word has ever come from Moria since.
"Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dáin, but not from Moria – from Mordor: a
horseman in the night, who called Dáin to his gate. The Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished
for our friendship. Rings he would give for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently
concerning _hobbits_, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. "For Sauron knows," said he,
"that one of these was known to you on a time."
'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his fell voice was lowered,
and he would have sweetened it if he could. "As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks
this," he said: "that you should find this thief," such was his word, "and get from him, willing or no,
a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest
of your good will. Find it, and three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to
you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still
lives and where, and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and
things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?"
'At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by shuddered, but Dáin said:
"I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak."
' "Consider well, but not too long," said he.
' "The time of my thought is my own to spend," answered Dáin.
' "For the present," said he, and rode into the darkness.
'Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We needed not the fell voice of
the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the
power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the
messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so he says, is soon to
come, before the ending of the year.
'And so I have been sent at last by Dáin to warn Bilbo that he is sought by the Enemy, and to
learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond.
For the Shadow grows and draws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also to King
Brand in Dale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is gathering on his
eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move Men of his rule to assail King Brand,
and Dáin also.'
`You have done well to come,' said Elrond. `You will hear today all that you need in order to
understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other than to resist, with
hope or without it. But you do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part of the
trouble of all the western world. The Ring! What shall we do with the Ring, the least of rings, the
trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we must deem.
`That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say. though I have not called you
to me, strangers from distant lands. You have come and are here met, in this very nick of time, by
chance as it may seem. Yet it is not so. Believe rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit here, and
none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world.
`Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until
this day. And first, so that all may understand what is the peril, the Tale of the Ring shall be told
from the beginning even to this present. And I will begin that tale, though others shall end it.'
Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power, and
their forging in the Second Age of the world long ago. A part of his tale was known to some there,
but the full tale to none, and many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the

Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness for knowledge, by
which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and they received his
aid and grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged
secretly in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was aware of
him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and the land was laid waste, and the
gate of Moria was shut.
Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since that history is elsewhere
recounted, even as Elrond himself set it down in his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a
long tale, full of deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up the sky,
and the morning was passing ere he ceased.
Of Númenor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the Kings of Men to Middle-earth
out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty
sons, Isildur and Anárion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the
South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor assailed them, and they
made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in
Arnor.
Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. `I remember well the splendour of their banners,'
he said. `It recalled to me the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great
princes and captains were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was
broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.'
`You remember?' said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment. `But I thought,' he
stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.'
'So it was indeed,' answered Elrond gravely. `But my memory reaches back even to the Elder
Days. Eärendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin before its fall; and my mother was Elwing,
daughter of Dior, son of Lúthien of Doriath. I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and
many defeats, and many fruitless victories.
`I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the Battle of Dagorlad before
the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of
Elendil, Aiglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of
Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself
was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword,
and took it for his own.'
At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. `So that is what became of the Ring!' he cried. `If ever
such a tale was told in the South, it has long been forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him
that we do not name; but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm.
Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.'
`Alas! yes,' said Elrond. `Isildur took it, as should not have been. It should have been cast then
into Orodruin's fire nigh at hand where it was made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone
stood by his father in that last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only Círdan stood, and I. But Isildur
would not listen to our counsel.
' "This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother," he said; and therefore whether we
would or no, he took it to treasure it. But soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named
in the North Isildur's Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him.
'Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small wonder it is that you have
not heard them, Boromir. From the ruin of the Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men
only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering. One of these was Ohtar, the esquire
of Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to Valandil, the heir of
Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in Rivendell. But Narsil was broken and its light
extinguished, and it has not yet been forged again.

`Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet it did not achieve its end.
Sauron was diminished, but not destroyed. His Ring was lost but not unmade. The Dark Tower was
broken, but its foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring, and
while it remains they will endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men, and many of their friends.
had perished in the war. Anárion was slain, and Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were
no more. Never again shall there be any such league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the
Firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that day the race of
Númenor has decayed, and the span of their years has lessened.
'In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were
diminished, and their city of Annúminas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of
Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs, and that now too is desolate.
Men call it Deadmen's Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor dwindled, and their
foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills.
'In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its splendour grew, recalling
somewhat of the might of Númenor, ere it fell. High towers that people built, and strong places. and
havens of many ships; and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many
tongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars. through the midst of which the River
flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the
Mountains of Shadow; and westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made,
Tower of the Setting Sun. There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the seed of that
tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed of that tree before came from Eressëa,
and before that out of the Uttermost West in the Day before days when the world was young.
`But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of Meneldil son of Anárion failed,
and the Tree withered, and the blood of the Númenoreans became mingled with that of lesser men.
Then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept, and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth. And on a
time evil things came forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and they made it into a place
of dread; and it is called Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew
Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard; and these two cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay
between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked.
'So it has been for many lives of men. But the Lords of Minas Tirith still fight on, defying our
enemies, keeping the passage of the River from Argonath to the Sea. And now that part of the tale
that I shall tell is drawn to its close. For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of all
knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion. But now in this latter day they are in
peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has been found. Others shall speak of its finding, for in
that I played small part.'
He ceased, but at once Boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. Give me leave, Master
Elrond, said he, first to say more of Gondor; for verily from the land of Gondor I am come. And it
would be well for all to know what passes there. For few, I deem, know of our deeds, and therefore
guess little of their peril, if we should fail at last.
`Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of Númenor is spent, nor all its pride and
dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the East are still restrained, and the terror of
Morgul kept at bay; and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us,
bulwark of the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then?
`Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has arisen again. Smoke rises
once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom. The power of the Black Land grows and we
are hard beset. When the Enemy returned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east of
the River, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. But this very year, in the days of
June, sudden war came upon us out of Mordor, and we were swept away. We were outnumbered,
for Mordor has allied itself with the Easterlings and the cruel Haradrim; but it was not by numbers
that we were defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before.

`Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark shadow under the moon.
Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear fell on our boldest, so that horse and man
gave way and fled. Only a remnant of our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that
still stood amid the ruins of Osgiliath.
'I was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down behind us. Four only were
saved by swimming: my brother and myself and two others. But still we fight on, holding all the
west shores of Anduin; and those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name:
much praise but little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we call.
`In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to Elrond: a hundred
and ten days I have journeyed all alone. But I do not seek allies in war. The might of Elrond is in
wisdom not in weapons, it is said. I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For
on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep; and afterwards a
like dream came oft to him again, and once to me.
'In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder, but in the
West a pale light lingered, and out of it I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:
Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In Imladris it dwells;
There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than Morgul-spells.
There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand,
For Isildur's Bane shall waken,
And the Halfling forth shall stand.
Of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, Denethor, Lord of Minas
Tirith, wise in the lore of Gondor. This only would he say, that Imladris was of old the name among
the Elves of a far northern dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters.
Therefore my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream and seek
for Imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, I took the journey upon myself. Loth
was my father to give me leave, and long have I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of
Elrond, of which many had heard, but few knew where it lay.'
'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you' said Aragorn, standing up. He
cast his sword upon the table that stood before Elrond, and the blade was in two pieces. `Here is the
Sword that was Broken!' he said.
`And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?' asked Boromir, looking in
wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his weather-stained cloak.
`He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,' said Elrond; `and he is descended through many fathers from
Isildur Elendil's son of Minas Ithil. He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now
left of that folk.'
`Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as
if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once.
'It does not belong to either of us,' said Aragorn; `but it has been ordained that you should hold it
for a while.'
'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. `The time has come. Hold it up, and then
Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.'
There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken by a sudden shame and
fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring, and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was
far away. The Ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand.
'Behold Isildur's Bane!' said Elrond.

Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. `The Halfling!' he muttered. `Is then the
doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then should we seek a broken sword?'
'The words were not _the doom of Minas Tirith_,' said Aragorn. `But doom and great deeds are
indeed at hand. For the Sword that was Broken is the Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him
when he fell. It has been treasured by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was
spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the Ring, Isildur's Bane, was found.
Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for the
House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?'
`I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a riddle,' answered Boromir
proudly. `Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if
such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past.' He looked again at Aragorn, and
doubt was in his eyes.
Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed on his friend's behalf.
Standing suddenly up he burst out:
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken:
The crownless again shall be king._
`Not very good perhaps, but to the point – if you need more beyond the word of Elrond. If that
was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear, you had best listen to it.' He sat down with a
snort.
`I made that up myself,' he whispered to Frodo, `for the Dúnadan, a long time ago when he first
told me about himself. I almost wish that my adventures were not over, and that I could go with
him when his day comes.'
Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. `For my part I forgive your doubt,' he
said. 'Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in
the halls of Denethor. I am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life and a
long; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small part in the count of my journeys.
I have crossed many mountains and many rivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far
countries of Rhûn and Harad where the stars are strange.
'But my home, such as I have, is in the North. For here the heirs of Valandil have ever dwelt in
long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations. Our days have darkened, and we
have dwindled; but ever the Sword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir,
ere I end. Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters – but hunters ever of the servants of the
Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor only.
`If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another part. Many evil things
there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay. You know little of the lands beyond
your bounds. Peace and freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us.
Fear would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the houseless hills, or creep
from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any dare to tread, what safety would there
be in quiet lands, or in the homes of simple men at night, if the Dúnedain were asleep, or were all
gone into the grave?

`And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and countrymen give us scornful
names. "Strider" I am to one fat man who lives within a day's march of foes that would freeze his
heart or lay his little town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have it
otherwise. If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, and we must be secret to
keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred, while the years have lengthened and the grass
has grown.
`But now the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur's Bane is found. Battle is
at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. I will come to Minas Tirith.'
`Isildur's Bane is found, you say,' said Boromir. `I have seen a bright ring in the Halfling's hand;
but Isildur perished ere this age of the world began, they say. How do the Wise know that this ring
is his? And how has it passed down the years, until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger?'
`That shall be told,' said Elrond.
`But not yet, I beg, Master!' said Bilbo. `Already the Sun is climbing to noon, and I feel the need
of something to strengthen me.'
`I had not named you,' said Elrond smiling. `But I do so now. Come! Tell us your tale. And if
you have not yet cast your story into verse, you may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner
shall you be refreshed.'
`Very well,' said Bilbo. `I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the true story, and if some here
have heard me tell it otherwise' – he looked sidelong at Glóin – `I ask them to forget it and forgive
me. I only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the name of
thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little better now. Anyway, this is what
happened.'
To some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new, and they listened with amazement while the old
hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did
not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from
the Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.
'Well told, my friend,' he said, `but that is enough at this time. For the moment it suffices to
know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let him now speak!'
Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with the Ring from the day that it
passed into his keeping. Every step of his journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was
questioned and considered, and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was
examined. At last he sat down again.
`Not bad,' Bilbo said to him. `You would have made a good story of it, if they hadn't kept on
interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we shall have to go over it all again together some
time, if I am to write it up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!'
`Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But the story still does not seem complete to
me. I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.'
Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. `You speak for me also,' he cried, and
turning to Elrond he said: `The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling's trove is
indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But
may we not hear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned in the lore
of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he knows the things that we have
heard?'
`The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond. `I had not overlooked
them, and they shall be answered. But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call
upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'
`Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof
enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then?
The Nine the Nazgûl keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.' At this Glóin stirred, but did not
speak. `The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much?

'There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the Mountain, between the loss and
the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of the Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For the
Enemy has been close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this year, this
very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth.
'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the doors of the
Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and found thus that our fears were
true: he was none other than Sauron, our Enemy of old, at length taking shape and power again.
Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and for
long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, and the Council put
forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood and that was in the very year of the finding of
this Ring: a strange chance, if chance it was.
`But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us, and had long prepared
against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants
dwelt, until all was ready. Then he gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after
came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council met; for
now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One. We feared then that he had
some news of it that we knew nothing of. But Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to
us before: that the One would never again be found in Middle-earth.
` "At the worst," said he, "our Enemy knows that we have it not and that it still is lost. But what
was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly
studied this matter? Into Anduin the Great it fell; and long ago, while Sauron slept, it was rolled
down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End."'
Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains, at
whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden. He sighed.
`There I was at fault,' he said. `I was lulled by the words of Saruman the Wise; but I should have
sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would now be less.'
`We were all at fault,' said Elrond, `and but for your vigilance the Darkness, maybe, would
already be upon us. But say on!'
`From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,' said Gandalf, `and I desired
to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it. So I set a watch for
him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He
came, but he escaped and was not found. And then alas! I let the matter rest, watching and waiting
only, as we have too often done.
`Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear. Whence
came the hobbit's ring? What, if my fear was true, should be done with it? Those things I must
decide. But I spoke yet of my dread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went
astray. In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe.
'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts, even beasts and
birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear grew. I called for the help of the Dúnedain, and
their watch was doubled; and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.'
`And I,' said Aragorn, `counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too late though it may seem.
And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf
on the long and hopeless search.'
Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, down even to the
Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. `There we had rumour of him, and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but we never found him, and at last I despaired. And then in
my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The ring
itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the Council came back to me: words of
Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard them now clearly in my heart.

` "The Nine, the Seven, and the Three," he said, "had each their proper gem. Not so the One. It
was round and unadorned, as it were one of the lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the
skilled, maybe, could still see and read."
`What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The maker. And Saruman?
But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What hand save Sauron's ever held this
thing, ere it was lost? The hand of Isildur alone.
`With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. In former days the
members of my order had been well received there, but Saruman most of all. Often he had been for
long the guest of the Lords of the City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of
old, and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.
' "If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, and the beginnings of the
City, read on! " he said. "For to me what was is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care.
But unless you have more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find naught
that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this City."
`So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can read, even of
the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there
lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed, a
scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor, as
some have told the tale.'
'Some in the North, maybe,' Boromir broke in. 'All know in Gondor that he went first to Minas
Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil, instructing him, before he committed to him the
rule of the South Kingdom. In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in
memory of his brother.'
`But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; `and that is not remembered in Gondor,
it would seem. For this scroll concerns the Ring, and thus wrote Isildur therein:
_The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but records of it shall be
left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these
great matters shall grow dim._
`And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it.
_It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was scorched, so that I doubt if ever
again I shall be free of the pain of it. Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink,
though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at first was as
clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. It is fashioned in an elven-script of
Eregion, for they have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to
me. I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it saith I do
not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat
of Sauron's hand, which was black and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and
maybe were the gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed. But for my part I will risk no
hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is precious to me, though I buy it with
great pain._
'When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing was indeed as Isildur
guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of the Tower. And what was said therein was
already known. For in the day that Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three,

was aware of him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes were
revealed.
`At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwards, messages came to me out
of Lórien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that he had found the creature called Gollum.
Therefore I went first to meet him and hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I
dared not guess.'
`There is little need to tell of them,' said Aragorn. `If a man must needs walk in sight of the
Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at
last, and I began my homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought:
the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and swift, and it led not to
Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking
by a stagnant mere, peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was covered
with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle. Nothing more
did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my
journey, the road back, watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on
his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever towards
Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should
be done; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look
upon him again; but Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.'
`Yes, long and weary,' said Gandalf, `but not without profit. For one thing, the tale he told of his
loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for the first time; but that mattered little,
since I had already guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum's ring came out of the Great
River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had possessed it long. Many lives of
his small kind. The power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power
only the Great Rings wield.
`And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that I spoke of. Upon this very
ring which you have here seen held aloft, round and unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may
still be read, if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I have
done, and this I have read:
_Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi
krimpatul.'_
The change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became menacing, powerful,
harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark.
All trembled, and the Elves stopped their ears.
`Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf the
Grey,' said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more.
`And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered Gandalf. `Nonetheless I do
not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the
West, then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared: the treasure
of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great part of his strength of old. Out of the
Black Years come the words that the Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been
betrayed:
_One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the
Darkness bind them._

`Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was loth to speak and his tale
was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was
forced from him. Thus the Enemy knows now that the One is found, that it was long in the Shire;
and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon will know, already he may know,
even as I speak, that we have it here.'
All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. `He is a small thing, you say, this
Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became of him? To what doom did you put him?'
'He is in prison, but no worse,' said Aragorn. `He had suffered much. There is no doubt that he
was tormented, and the fear of Sauron lies black on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is
safely kept by the watchful Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and withered. He could work much mischief still, if he were free. And
I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand.'
`Alas! alas!' cried Legolas, and in his fair elvish face there was great distress. `The tidings that I
was sent to bring must now be told. They are not good, but only here have I learned how evil they
may seem to this company. Sméagol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.'
'Escaped?' cried Aragorn. 'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it bitterly, I fear. How came
the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?'
`Not through lack of watchfulness,' said Legolas; `but perhaps through over-kindliness. And we
fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that more is known of our doings than we could
wish. We guarded this creature day and night, at Gandalf's bidding, much though we wearied of the
task. But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep him ever in
dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old black thoughts.'
'You were less tender to me,' said Glóin with a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred of
his imprisonment in the deep places of the Elven-king's halls.
'Now come!' said Gandalf. `Pray do not interrupt, my good Glóin. That was a regrettable
misunderstanding, long set right. If all the grievances that stand between Elves and Dwarves are to
be brought up here, we may as well abandon this Council.'
Glóin rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. 'In the days of fair weather we led Gollum
through the woods; and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others which he liked to
climb. Often we let him mount up to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a
guard at the tree's foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind to climb
after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands; so
they sat by the tree far into the night.
'It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that Orcs came on us at unawares.
We drove them off after some time; they were many and fierce, but they came from over the
mountains, and were unused to the woods. When the battle was over, we found that Gollum was
gone, and his guards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made
for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was contrived we cannot guess; but
Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy are many. The dark things that were driven out in
the year of the Dragon's fall have returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place,
save where our realm is maintained.
`We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among those of many Orcs, and it
plunged deep into the Forest, going south. But ere long it escaped our skill, and we dared not
continue the hunt; for we were drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do
not go that way.'
`Well, well, he is gone,' said Gandalf. 'We have no time to seek for him again. He must do what
he will. But he may play a part yet that neither he nor Sauron have foreseen.

'And now I will answer Galdor's other questions. What of Saruman? What are his counsels to us
in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will
bear on all that we must resolve. It is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it has yet
gone.
'At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind, and I rode to the
southern borders of the little land; for I had a foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but
drawing near. There messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I
heard of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives from
the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak. I turned then
east and north and journeyed along the Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller
sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast the Brown,
who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. He is one of my order, but I
had not seen him for many a year.
` "Gandalf! " he cried. "I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in these parts. All I knew was
that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of Shire."
' "Your information was correct," I said. "But do not put it that way, if you meet any of the
inhabitants. You are near the borders of the Shire now. And what do you want with me? It must be
pressing. You were never a traveller, unless driven by great need."
' "I have an urgent errand," he said. "My news is evil." Then he looked about him, as if the
hedges might have ears. "Nazgûl," he whispered. "The Nine are abroad again. They have crossed
the River secretly and are moving westward. They have taken the guise of riders in black."
'I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it.
` "The enemy must have some great need or purpose," said Radagast; "but what it is that makes
him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot guess."
` "What do you mean? " said I.
` "I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a land called Shire."
' "_The_ Shire," I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might fear to withstand the Nine,
when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain. A great king and sorcerer he was of old,
and now he wields a deadly fear. "Who told you, and who sent you? " I asked.
' "Saruman the White," answered Radagast. "And he told me to say that if you feel the need, he
will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it will be too late."
'And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the greatest of my order.
Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much
lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied the arts
of the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was by the devices of
Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he had found some weapons that
would drive back the Nine.
' "I will go to Saruman," I said.
' "Then you must go _now_," said Radagast; "for I have wasted time in looking for you, and the
days are running short. I was told to find you before Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you
set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. I
myself shall turn back at once." And with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off.
` "Stay a moment! " I said. "We shall need your help, and the help of all things that will give it.
Send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends. Tell them to bring news of
anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc."
` "I will do that," he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after him.

`I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far already that day, and I was as weary
as my horse; and I needed to consider matters. I stayed the night in Bree, and decided that I had no
time to return to the Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake!
`However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him. I
rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in
Isengard, in the end of the Misty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell
you that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills
of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that
enclose a valley as with a wall, and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It
was not made by Saruman, but by the Men of Númenor long ago; and it is very tall and has many
secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
Isengard; and in that circle there is only one gate.
'Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it was strongly
guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited
me. I rode under the arch, and the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though
I knew no reason for it.
'But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman and there he met me and led
me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his finger.
` "So you have come, Gandalf," he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white
light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.
` "Yes, I have come," I said. "I have come for your aid, Saruman the White." And that title
seemed to anger him.
' "Have you indeed, Gandalf the _Grey_! " he scoffed. "For aid? It has seldom been heard of that
Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and
concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not."
'I looked at him and wondered. "But if I am not deceived," said I, "things are now moving which
will require the union of all our strength."
' "That may be so," he said, "but the thought is late in coming to you. How long. I wonder, have
you concealed from me, the head of the Council, a matter of greatest import? What brings you now
from your lurking-place in the Shire? "
' "The Nine have come forth again," I answered. "They have crossed the River. So Radagast said
to me."
` "Radagast the Brown! " laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed his scorn. "Radagast the
Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I
set him. For you have come, and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay,
Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker,
Saruman of Many Colours! "
'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of
all colours. and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.
' "I liked white better," I said.
' "White! " he sneered. "It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can
be overwritten; and the white light can be broken."
' "In which case it is no longer white," said I. "And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is
has left the path of wisdom."
' "You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for friends," said he. "I have not
brought you hither to be instructed by you, but to give you a choice."
'He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a speech long rehearsed.
"The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The
time of the Elves is over, but our time is at hand: the world of Men, which we must rule. But we
must have power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the Wise can see.

' "And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! " he said, coming near and speaking now in a
softer voice. "I said we, for we it may be, if you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against
it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying
Númenor. This then is one choice before you. before us. We may join with that Power. It would be
wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those
that aided it. As the Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you and
I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we can
keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and
ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to
accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. There need not be, there
would not be, any real change in our designs, only in our means."
' "Saruman," I said, "I have heard speeches of this kind before, but only in the mouths of
emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I cannot think that you brought me so far only
to weary my ears."
'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. "Well, I see that this wise course
does not commend itself to you," he said. "Not yet? Not if some better way can be contrived? "
`He came and laid his long hand on my arm. "And why not, Gandalf? " he whispered. "Why
not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then the Power would pass to us. That is in truth
why I brought you here. For I have many eyes in my service, and I believe that you know where
this precious thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what is your
business there? " As he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone suddenly in his eyes.
' "Saruman," I said, standing away from him, "only one hand at a time can wield the One, and
you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! But I would not give it, nay, I would not give even
news of it to you, now that I learn your mind. You were head of the Council, but you have
unmasked yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or to yourself. I will
take neither. Have you others to offer? "
'He was cold now and perilous. "Yes," he said. "I did not expect you to show wisdom, even in
your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. and so saving yourself much
trouble and pain. The third choice is to stay here, until the end."
' "Until what end? "
' "Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find means to persuade you. Or
until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a
fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey."
' "That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters," said I. He laughed at me, for my words
were empty, and he knew it.
`They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc, in the place where Saruman
was accustomed to watch the stars. There is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand
steps, and the valley below seems far away. I looked on it and saw that, whereas it had once been
green and fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in Isengard, for
Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in rivalry of Sauron and not in his service
yet. Over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood
alone on an island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were bitter. I was
pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace to and fro, brooding on the coming of
the Riders to the North.
`That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words of Saruman which might be
lies. Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear
was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had
set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly
pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope was founded on a
fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have

many calls to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in the circle of
Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or
fallen would falter in the Shire far away.'
`I saw you!' cried Frodo. `You were walking backwards and forwards. The moon shone in your
hair.'
Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'It was only a dream' said Frodo, `but it suddenly
came back to me. I had quite forgotten it. It came some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.'
`Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see. I was in an evil plight. And those
who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need, and do not bear such misfortune
well. Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle
spiders may leave a weak thread.
`At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had also fallen. Yet I had caught
no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have
gone to Isengard, or I should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed
his mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to try and win over
the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me.
`That was the undoing of Saruman's plot. For Radagast knew no reason why he should not do as
I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where he had many friends of old. And the Eagles of
the Mountains went far and wide, and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the
mustering of Orcs; and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard news
of the escape of Gollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me.
`So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and Gwaihir the Windlord,
swiftest of the Great Eagles, came unlooked-for to Orthanc; and he found me standing on the
pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and he bore me away, before Saruman was aware. I was far from
Isengard, ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me.
` "How far can you bear me? " I said to Gwaihir.
` "Many leagues," said he, "but not to the ends of the earth. I was sent to bear tidings not
burdens."
` "Then I must have a steed on land," I said, "and a steed surpassingly swift, for I have never had
such need of haste before."
` "Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his halls," he said; "for that is
not very far off." And I was glad, for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords,
dwell, and there are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty
Mountains and the White.
` "Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think? " I said to Gwaihir, for the treason of
Saruman had shaken my faith.
` "They pay a tribute of horses," he answered, "and send many yearly to Mordor, or so it is said;
but they are not yet under the yoke. But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom
cannot be long delayed."
`He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have lengthened my tale over long.
The rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the
king of the land would not listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose
one much to my liking. but little to his. I took the best horse in his land, and I have never seen the
like of him.'
'Then he must be a noble beast indeed,' said Aragorn; 'and it grieves me more than many tidings
that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that
land.'

`Nor is it now, I will swear,' said Boromir. `It is a lie that comes from the Enemy. I know the
Men of Rohan; true and valiant, our allies, dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.'
`The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,' answered Aragorn. 'Saruman has fallen under it.
Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find there, if ever you return?'
`Not this at least.' said Boromir, 'that they will buy their lives with horses. They love their horses
next to their kin. And not without reason, for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of
the North, far from the Shadow. and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the free
days of old.'
'True indeed!' said Gandalf. `And there is one among them that might have been foaled in the
morning of the world. The horses of the Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing
wind. Shadowfax they called him. By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a
shade, and he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man mounted him, but I
took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on
the Barrow-downs, though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.
'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the Riders, and though I
gained on them day by day, they were ever before me. They had divided their forces, I learned:
some remained on the eastern borders, not far from the Greenway. and some invaded the Shire
from the south. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old Gamgee. Many
words and few to the point. He had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag
End.
` "I can't abide changes," said he, "not at my time of life, and least of all changes for the worst."
"Changes for the worst," he repeated many times.
' "Worst is a bad word," I said to him, "and I hope you do not live to see it." But amidst his talk I
gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman had
come to the Hill the same evening. Then I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in
uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came to the house at
Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had
been Frodo's. Then for a while hope left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been
comforted; but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went many ways, and I
was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for
I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper.
' "Butterbur they call him," thought I. "If this delay was his fault, I will melt all the butter in him.
I will roast the old fool over a slow fire." He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell
down flat and began to melt on the spot.'
`What did you do to him?' cried Frodo in alarm. 'He was really very kind to us and did all that he
could.'
Gandalf laughed. 'Don't be afraid!' he said. `I did not bite, and I barked very little. So overjoyed
was I by the news that I got out of him, when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow.
How it happened I could not then guess, but I learned that you had been in Bree the night before,
and had gone off that morning with Strider.
` "Strider! " I cried, shouting for joy.
` "Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir," said Butterbur, mistaking me. "He got at them, in spite of all that
I could do, and they took up with him. They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful,
you might say."
` "Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman! " said I. "It's the best news I have had since
midsummer: it's worth a gold piece at the least. May your beer be laid under an enchantment of
surpassing excellence for seven years! " said I. "Now I can take a night's rest, the first since I have
forgotten when."

`So I stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the Riders; for only of two
had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed. But in the night we heard more. Five at least came
from the west, and they threw down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the
Bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. I got up before dawn and went after
them.
'I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. Their Captain remained in
secret away south of Bree, while two rode ahead through the village, and four more invaded the
Shire. But when these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to their Captain with
tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. The Captain then sent
some eastward straight across country, and he himself with the rest rode along the Road in great
wrath.
'I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my second day from
Bree-and they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my
anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I
was besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Sûl. I was hard put to it indeed: such light and
flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old.
`At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to do more. It was impossible
to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my
heels. So I had to trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach Rivendell
ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, but they turned back after a
while and made for the Ford, it seems. That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when
your camp was attacked.
'I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Hoarwell and through the Ettenmoors, and
down from the north. It took me nearly fourteen days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among
the rocks of the troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I sent him back to his master; but a great
friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my call. But so it was that I
came to Rivendell only three days before the Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought
here-which proved well indeed.
`And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the others forgive the length of it.
But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he
promised. An account to the Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think.
'Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last. Here we all are, and here is the Ring. But we have
not yet come any nearer to our purpose. What shall we do with it?'
There was silence. At last Elrond spoke again.
`This is grievous news concerning Saruman,' he said; `for we trusted him and he is deep in all
our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such
falls and betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of
Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; and it seems to me that
he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I
last was on the westward roads.
`The Barrow-wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest many tales have been told:
all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern march. Time was when a squirrel could go
from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I
journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed
this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old.
That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many
another name he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men,

and other names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned him to our
Council.'
`He would not have come,' said Gandalf.
`Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?' asked Erestor. `It seems that he
has a power even over the Ring.'
`No, I should not put it so,' said Gandalf. `Say rather that the Ring has no power over him. He is
his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is
withdrawn into a little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, waiting
perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.'
`But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,' said Erestor. `Would he not take the
Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?'
`No,' said Gandalf, `not willingly. He might do so, if all the free folk of the world begged him,
but he would not understand the need. And if he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or
most likely throw it away. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe
guardian; and that alone is answer enough.'
`But in any case,' said Glorfindel, `to send the Ring to him would only postpone the day of evil.
He is far away. We could not now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even
if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all
his power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the
end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First; and then Night will come.'
`I know little of Iarwain save the name,' said Galdor; `but Glorfindel, I think, is right. Power to
defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron
can torture and destroy the very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or
with Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lórien. But have they the strength, have we here the strength to
withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, when all else is overthrown?'
`I have not the strength,' said Elrond; `neither have they.'
`Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength' said Glorfindel, `two things only
remain for us to attempt: to send it over the Sea, or to destroy it.'
`But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,' said
Elrond. `And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to
Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.'
'Then, said Glorfindel, 'let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the lies of Saruman come true.
For it is clear now that even at the Council his feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that
the Ring was not lost for ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. Yet
oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.'
`Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf. `There are many things in the deep waters; and seas and lands
may change. And it is not our part here to take thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men,
or for a passing age of the world. We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not hope
to make one.'
'And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,' said Galdor. 'If the return to Iarwain be
thought too dangerous, then flight to the Séa is now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me
that Sauron will expect us to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will.
The Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new steeds and swifter.
Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the coasts
into the North; and if he comes, assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves
may have no escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.'
'Long yet will that march be delayed,' said Boromir. 'Gondor wanes, you say. But Gondor
stands, and even the end of its strength is still very strong.'
'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,' said Galdor. 'And other roads he may
find that Gondor does not guard.'

'Then,' said Erestor, `there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already has declared: to hide the
Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But both are beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?'
'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely. `At least none can foretell what will come to pass, if
we take this road or that. But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take. The
westward road seems easiest. Therefore it must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often the Elves
have fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our
hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril-to Mordor. We must send the Ring to the Fire.'
Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the
noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him.
He was fingering his great horn and frowning. At length he spoke.
'I do not understand all this,' he said. `Saruman is a traitor, but did he not have a glimpse of
wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying? Why should we not think that the Great
Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of
the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem.
'The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they may be beaten down.
Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the Ring be your weapon, if it has such power
as you say. Take it and go forth to victory!'
'Alas, no,' said Elrond. 'We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs
to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for
anyone to wield at will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for them
it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of
the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then
set himself on Sauron's throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason
why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise.
For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will
not take the Ring to wield it.'
`Nor I,' said Gandalf.
Boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. `So be it,' he said. `Then in Gondor
we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring,
we will fight on. Mayhap the Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide – if the hand that
wields it has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.'
`Who can tell?' said Aragorn. `But we will put it to the test one day.'
`May the day not be too long delayed,' said Boromir. 'For though I do not ask for aid, we need it.
It would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that they have.'
`Then be comforted,' said Elrond. `For there are other powers and realms that you know not, and
they are hidden from you. Anduin the Great flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and
the Gates of Gondor.'
'Still it might be well for all,' said Glóin the Dwarf, 'if all these strengths were joined, and the
powers of each were used in league. Other rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used
in our need. The Seven are lost to us – if Balin has not found the ring of Thrór which was the last;
naught has been heard of it since Thrór perished in Moria. Indeed I may now reveal that it was
partly in hope to find that ring that Balin went away.'
`Balin will find no ring in Moria,' said Gandalf. `Thrór gave it to Thráin his son, but not Thráin
to Thorin. It was taken with torment from Thráin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.'
'Ah, alas!' cried Glóin. 'When will the day come of our revenge? But still there are the Three.
What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep
them? Yet they too were made by the Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will
they not say?'

The Elves returned no answer. `Did you not hear me, Glóin?' said Elrond. `The Three were not
made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only
in this hour of doubt I may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons of war
or conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or
hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and healing, to preserve all things unstained. These
things the Elves of Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that has
been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing, and their minds and hearts
will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the One. It would be better if the Three had never
been. That is his purpose.'
`But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you counsel?' asked Glóin.
'We know not for certain,' answered Elrond sadly. `Some hope that the Three Rings, which
Sauron has never touched, would then become free, and their rulers might heal the hurts of the
world that he has wrought. But maybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair
things will fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.'
`Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,' said Glorfindel 'if by it the power of Sauron
may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever.'
'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,' said Erestor, `and yet we come no
nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the Fire in which it was made? That is the path of
despair. Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.'
'Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf. `It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end
beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been
weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our
cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in
the scales of his malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he
judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having the
Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of reckoning.'
'At least for a while,' said Elrond. `The road must be trod, but it will be very hard. And neither
strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world:
small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.'
'Very well, very well, Master Elrond!' said Bilbo suddenly. 'Say no more! It is plain enough
what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or
himself. I was very comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am just
writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: _and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end
of his days_. It is a good ending, and none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have
to alter that: it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to be several
more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful nuisance. When ought I to start?
' Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the
others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect. Only Glóin smiled, but his smile came from old
memories.
`Of course, my dear Bilbo,' said Gandalf. `If you had really started this affair, you might be
expected to finish it. But you know well enough now that _starting_ is too great a claim for any,
and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the
word was meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one
beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need my
advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and
leave the ending unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when they
come back.'

Bilbo laughed. `I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.' he said. `As all your
unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this advice is not bad. Still, I don't suppose I have the
strength or luck left to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do you
mean by _they_?'
`The messengers who are sent with the Ring.'
`Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council has to decide, and all
that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I
am only an old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon. Can't you think of some names now? Or put it
off till after dinner?'
No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced at all the faces, but
they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great
dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen
and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at
peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered
to hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.
`I will take the Ring,' he said, `though I do not know the way.'
Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden
keenness of the glance. `If I understand aright all that I have heard,' he said, `I think that this task is
appointed for you, Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is the hour of the
Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great.
Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect to know
it, until the hour has struck?
`But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. I do not lay it on you. But
if you take it freely, I will say that your choice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old,
Hador, and Húrin, and Túrin, and Beren himself were assembled together your seat should be
among them.'
`But you won't send him off alone surely, Master?' cried Sam, unable to contain himself any
longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor.
`No indeed!' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. `You at least shall go with him. It is
hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you
are not.'
Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. `A nice pickle we have landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!'
he said, shaking his head.
_Chapter 3_
The Ring Goes South
Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo's room. Merry and Pippin were
indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's
companion.
`It's most unfair,' said Pippin. `Instead of throwing him out, and clapping him in chains, Elrond
goes and rewards him for his cheek!'
`Rewards!' said Frodo. 'I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You are not thinking what
you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my
task was done, and I could rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.'

'I don't wonder,' said Merry, 'and I wish you could. But we are envying Sam, not you. If you
have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have
come a long way with you and been through some stiff times. We want to go on.'
`That's what I meant,' said Pippin. `We hobbits ought to stick together, and we will. I shall go,
unless they chain me up. There must be someone with intelligence in the party.'
'Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!' said Gandalf, looking in through the
window, which was near the ground. `But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing
is decided yet.'
`Nothing decided!' cried Pippin. 'Then what were you all doing? You were shut up for hours.'
"Talking,' said Bilbo. `There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an eye-opener. Even old
Gandalf. I think Legolas's bit of news about Gollum caught even him on the hop, though he passed
it off.'
`You were wrong,' said Gandalf. 'You were inattentive. I had already heard of it from Gwaihir.
If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the
only one that was not surprised.'
`Well, anyway,' said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam. I was
afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out
a fair number, when the reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?'
'Yes,' said the wizard. `Some of the scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow.
Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil's
folk in Mirkwood. And Aragorn has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have to scour the lands all
round for many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will probably
make quite a long stay here.'
'Ah!' said Sam gloomily. 'We'll just wait long enough for winter to come.'
'That can't be helped,' said Bilbo. 'It's your fault partly, Frodo my lad: insisting on waiting for
my birthday. A funny way of honouring it, I can't help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen
for letting the S.-B.s into Bag End. But there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't go
till the reports come back.
When winter first begins to bite
and stones crack in the frosty night,
when pools are black and trees are bare,
'tis evil in the Wild to fare.
But that I am afraid will be just your luck.'
'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf. 'We can't start until we have found out about the Riders.'
`I thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said Merry.
'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf. `The power of their master is in them,
and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for
a while less dangerous; but we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget
your troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will whisper this in your
ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party. He was right. I think I shall
come with you.'
So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he
had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. 'I only said _I think I shall come_. Do not count
on anything yet. In this matter Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which
reminds me, I want to see Elrond. I must be off.'
`How long do you think I shall have here?' said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone.

`Oh, I don't know. I can't count days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo. 'But quite long, I should think.
We can have many a good talk. What about helping me with my book, and making a start on the
next? Have you thought of an ending?'
'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo.
'Oh, that won't do!' said Bilbo. `Books ought to have good endings. How would this do: _and
they all settled down and lived together happily ever after_?'
`It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo.
'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.'
For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay
ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted
from their minds. The future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over the
present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with each good day as it
came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word and song.
So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and each evening followed
cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale silver, and the
lingering leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to
the east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But
low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and
brighter. Frodo could see it from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that
glared above the trees on the brink of the valley.
The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and November had gone by
with the last shreds of autumn, and December was passing, when the scouts began to return. Some
had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west,
and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood, as far
as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town. Many had gone east and
south; and some of these had crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over
the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel. Radagast
was not there; and they had returned over the high pass that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons
of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down
the Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak to any save to
Elrond.
In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the Riders or other servants
of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news.
Nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were
hunting again far up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in
the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more,
and also a long black cloak, slashed and tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen,
and nowhere was their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North.
'Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf. 'It is rash to be too sure, yet I
think that we may hope now that the Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as
best they could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless.
`If that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again. Of course the Enemy has
other servants, but they will have to journey all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can
pick up our trail. And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no longer.'
Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. 'The time has come,' he said.
`If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But those who go with it must not count on their errand
being aided by war or force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you
still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?'
'I do,' said Frodo. `I will go with Sam.'

`Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond. `I can foresee very little of
your road; and how your task is to be achieved I do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the
feet of the Mountains, and draws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood; and under the Shadow all
is dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and you may find friends
upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out messages, such as I can contrive, to those
whom I know in the wide world; but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well
miscarry, or come no quicker than you yourself.
`And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will or fortune allows. The
number must be few, since your hope is in speed and secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of
the Elder Days, it would avail little, save to arouse the power of Mordor.
`The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine
Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great
task, and maybe the end of his labours.
`For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the World: Elves, Dwarves, and
Men. Legolas shall be for the Elves; and Gimli son of Glóin for the Dwarves. They are willing to
go at least to the passes of the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son
of Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.'
`Strider!' said Frodo.
'Yes,' he said with a smile. `I ask leave once again to be your companion, Frodo.'
`I would have begged you to come,' said Frodo, 'only I thought you were going to Minas Tirith
with Boromir.'
`I am,' said Aragorn. `And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged ere I set out to war. But
your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in
the Company. He is a valiant man.'
'There remain two more to be found,' said Elrond. "These I will consider. Of my household I
may find some that it seems good to me to send.'
`But that will leave no place for us!' cried Pippin in dismay. `We don't want to be left behind.
We want to go with Frodo.'
`That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead,' said Elrond.
`Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. 'Nor do any of us see
clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood the danger, they would not dare to go. But they
would still wish to go, or wish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in
this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom. Even if you
chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road
to the Fire by the power that is in him.'
`You speak gravely,' said Elrond, `but I am in doubt. The Shire, I forebode, is not free now from
peril; and these two I had thought to send back there as messengers, to do what they could,
according to the fashion of their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge
that the younger of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against his going.'
`Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me home tied in a sack,' said
Pippin. `For otherwise I shall follow the Company.'
`Let it be so then. You shall go,' said Elrond, and he sighed. 'Now the tale of Nine is filled. In
seven days the Company must depart.'
The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade was traced a device of
seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was written many
runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was
that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the
moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it
Andúril, Flame of the West.

Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would
meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of
Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he
spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.
In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among
many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel;
but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with
Bilbo in his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which still seemed
very incomplete). or scraps of his verses, or would take notes of Frodo's adventures.
On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, and the old hobbit pulled out from
under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and fumbled inside.
'Here is your sword,' he said. 'But it was broken, you know. I took it to keep it safe but I've
forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. No time now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to
have this, don't you know?'
He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew it, and its
polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold and bright. 'This is Sting,' he said, and
thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden beam. `Take it, if you like. I shan't want it again, I
expect.'
Frodo accepted it gratefully.
'Also there is this!' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for its size.
He unwound several folds of old cloth, and held up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of
many rings, as supple almost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit silver,
and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and crystal.
'It's a pretty thing, isn't it?' said Bilbo, moving it in the light. `And useful. It is my dwarf-mail
that Thorin gave me. I got it back from Michel Delving before I started, and packed it with my
luggage: I brought all the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not
expect to use this, and I don't need it now, except to look at sometimes. You hardly feel any weight
when you put it on.'
`I should look – well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said Frodo.
`Just what I said myself,' said Bilbo. 'But never mind about looks. You can wear it under your
outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should
feel happier if I knew you were wearing it. I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black
Riders,' he ended in a low voice.
`Very well, I will take it,' said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and fastened Sting upon the glittering
belt; and then Frodo put over the top his old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket.
'Just a plain hobbit you look,' said Bilbo. 'But there is more about you now than appears on the
surface. Good luck to you!' He turned away and looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune.
'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all our past kindnesses,' said Frodo.
'Don't try!' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the back. `Ow!' he cried. `You
are too hard now to slap! But there you are: Hobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses.
All I ask in return is: take as much care of yourself as you can. and bring back all the news you can,
and any old songs and tales you can come by. I'll do my best to finish my book before you return. I
should like to write the second book, if I am spared.' He broke off and turned to the window again,
singing softly.
I sit beside the fire and think
of all that I have seen,
of meadow-flowers and butterflies
in summers that have been;

Of yellow leaves and gossamer
in autumns that there were,
with morning mist and silver sun
and wind upon my hair.
I sit beside the fire and think
of how the world will be
when winter comes without a spring
that I shall ever see.
For still there are so many things
that I have never seen:
in every wood in every spring
there is a different green.
I sit beside the fire and think
of people long ago,
and people who will see a world
that I shall never know.
But all the while I sit and think
of times there were before,
I listen for returning feet
and voices at the door.
It was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was streaming through the bare
branches of the trees, and seething in the dark pines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying
overhead, dark and low. As the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company
made ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to journey under
cover of night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.
`You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,' he said. 'I do not doubt that news of
the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached him, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now
his spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must
beware as you go on your way.'
The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not in battle. Aragorn had
Andúril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad only in rusty green and brown. as a Ranger of
the wilderness. Boromir had a long sword, in fashion like Andúril but of less lineage and he bore
also a shield and his war-horn.
'Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,' he said, `and then let all the foes of Gondor
flee!' Putting it to his lips he blew a blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard
that voice in Rivendell sprang to their feet.
Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond. 'until you stand once more on
the borders of your land, and dire need is on you.'
`Maybe,' said Boromir. 'But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth, and though thereafter
we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth as a thief in the night.'
Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for dwarves make light of
burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a
long white knife. The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but
Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff,

but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast
of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain.
All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had jackets and cloaks
lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony, none
other than the poor beast that they had brought from Bree.
?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he was glossy and seemed
to have the vigour of youth. It was Sam who had insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as
he called him) would pine, if he did not come.
`That animal can nearly talk,' he said, `and would talk, if he stayed here much longer. He gave
me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: if you don't let me go with you, Sam, I'll follow on
my own.' So Bill was going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company
that did not seem depressed.
Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for
Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A gleam of firelight came from the open doors,
and soft lights were glowing in many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the
doorstep beside Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully what
this hour meant to him. The others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness.
Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily into the gloom where the
river roared stonily below; his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb.
`Bill, my lad,' he said, `you oughtn't to have took up with us. You could have stayed here and et
the best hay till the new grass comes.' Bill swished his tail and said nothing.
Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he
had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and
the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed
(but not near enough, I'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen hose: linen; various small belongings of
his master's that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they
were called for. He went through them all.
'Rope!' he muttered. `No rope! And only last night you said to yourself: "Sam, what about a bit
of rope? You'll want it, if you haven't got it:" Well, I'll want it. I can't get it now.'
At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him. 'This is my
last word,' he said in a low voice. 'The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On
him alone is any charge laid: neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the
Enemy nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the Council, and only
then in gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, to help him on his way. You may
tarry, or come back, or turn aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less
easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will. For you
do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the
road.'
`Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said Gimli.
'Maybe,' said Elrond, `but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall.'
'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said Gimli.
`Or break it,' said Elrond. `Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, and
may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your
faces!'
'Good . . . good luck!' cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. 'I don't suppose you will be able to
keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back. And don't be too
long! Farewell!'

Many others of Elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them go, bidding them
farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no song or music. At last they turned away
and faded silently into the dusk.
They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale
of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather.
Then with one glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far into
the night.
At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths
among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many
miles and days. The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great
River in Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; but they hoped
in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been
seen in this empty country, and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell.
Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark. The
others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard. The first part of
their journey was hard and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many
sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed able to keep
out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either
moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or
hidden under the tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late afternoon
they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and cheerless as a rule, for they
could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In the evening they went on again, always as nearly
southward as they could find a way.
At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary,
they were creeping forward like snails, and getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the
same as it had the day before. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell
they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled
an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and
winding, and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.
They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind suddenly fell and
then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted and melted away, and the sun came
out, pale and bright. There came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The
travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly-trees whose grey-green trunks seemed to
have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed
red in the light of the rising sun.
Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand
across the path that the Company was taking. At the left of this high range rose three peaks; the
tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was
still largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed red.
Gandalf stood at Frodo's side and looked out under his hand. `We have done well,' he said. `We
have reached the borders of the country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier
days, when Eregion was its name. Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though
many long miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be milder now, but
perhaps all the more dangerous.'
`Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,' said Frodo, throwing back his hood and
letting the morning light fall on his face.
'But the mountains are ahead of us,' said Pippin. `We must have turned eastwards in the night.'

'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you see further ahead in the clear light. Beyond those peaks the range
bends round south-west. There are many maps in Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought
to look at them?'
`Yes I did, sometimes,' said Pippin, `but I don't remember them. Frodo has a better head for that
sort of thing.'
`I need no map,' said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was gazing out before him with
a strange light in his deep eyes. `There is the land where our fathers worked of old, and we have
wrought the image of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs
and tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathûr.
`Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know them and their names,
for under them lies Khazad-dûm, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the
Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are
Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirak-zigil
and Bundushathûr.
`There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies the deep-shadowed valley
which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.'
`It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf. `If we climb the pass that is called
the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the
deep vale of the Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in its icy
springs.'
`Dark is the water of Kheled-zâram,' said Gimli, `and cold are the springs of Kibil-nâla. My
heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon.'
`May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf l' said Gandalf. 'But whatever you may do, we at
least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to
the Great River, and then -'
He paused.
'Yes, and where then?' asked Merry.
'To the end of the journey – in the end,' said Gandalf. 'We cannot look too far ahead. Let us be
glad that the first stage is safely over. I think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well.
There is a wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the
Elves, if once they dwelt there.'
'That is true,' said Legolas. `But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan
folk, and the trees and the grass do not now remember them: Only I hear the stones lament them:
_deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone_. They are
gone. They sought the Havens long ago.'
That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly, and their
supper-breakfast was merrier than it had been since they set out. They did not hurry to bed
afterwards, for they expected to have all the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again
until the evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while he left the
Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out
southwards and westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink
of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking.
`What is the matter, Strider?' Merry called up. 'What are you looking for? Do you miss the East
Wind?'
'No indeed,' he answered. `But I miss something. I have been in the country of Hollin in many
seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other creatures live here at all times, especially birds.
Yet now all things but you are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for miles about us, and your
voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.'

Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. `But what do you guess is the reason?' he asked. `Is
there more in it than surprise at seeing four hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are
so seldom seen or heard?'
`I hope that is it,' answered Aragorn. `But I have a sense of watchfulness, and of fear, that I have
never had here before.'
"Then we must be more careful,' said Gandalf. 'If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay
attention to him, especially if the Ranger is Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and
set the watch.'
It was Sam's turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep.
Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it. The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard.
The swish of the pony's tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam
could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around him, and over all hung a
clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East. Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and
grew, and drove north like flying smoke in the wind.
`What's that, Strider? It don't look like a cloud,' said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn. He made no
answer, he was gazing intently at the sky; but before long Sam could see for himself what was
approaching. Flocks of birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all
the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily drawing nearer.
`Lie flat and still!' hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade of a holly-bush; for a whole
regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host, and came, flying low, straight
towards the ridge. Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in
so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one harsh croak
was heard.
Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the sky was again clear would
Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf.
`Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the Mountains and the
Greyflood,' he said, `and they have passed over Hollin. They are not natives here; they are
_crebain_ out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do not know what they are about: possibly there is some
trouble away south from which they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have also
glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move again this evening.
Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being watched.'
`And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,' said Gandalf; `and how we can get over that without
being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of that when we must. As for moving as soon as it
is dark, I am afraid that you are right.'
`Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the _crebain_ came,' said
Aragorn. `It must be put out and not lit again.'
`Well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no fire, and a move again by
night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke in the late afternoon. 'All because of a pack of
crows! I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight: something hot.'
`Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. `There may be many unexpected feasts
ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet. However, we
are certain of one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south.'
'Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,' muttered Sam to Frodo. 'But I'm beginning to think it's time we
got a sight of that Fiery Mountain and saw the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that
this here Redhorn, or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair jawcracker dwarf-language must be!' Maps conveyed nothing to Sam's mind, and all distances in these
strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning.

All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over now and again; but as
the westering Sun grew red they disappeared southwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning
now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly red
in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded.
Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient
road, that had once been broad and well planned, from Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon,
now at the full, rose over the mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were
black. Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay tumbled and
ruinous in a bleak, barren land.
It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon was low. Frodo looked up at
the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded
and then flashed out again. He shivered.
`Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just ahead.
`No, but I felt it, whatever it was,' he answered. `It may be nothing, only a wisp of thin cloud.'
`It was moving fast then,' muttered Aragorn, `and not with the wind.'
Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even brighter than before. But
the air was chill again; already the wind was turning back towards the east. For two more nights
they marched on, climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and
the mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose before them, a
mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with
blood.
There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had gone now round to the
north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back.
`Winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to Aragorn. 'The heights away north are whiter than
they were; snow is lying far down their shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards
the Redhorn Gate. We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some
evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you think of your course
now, Aragorn?'
Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some
debate that had begun long before. He listened anxiously.
'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,' answered
Aragorn. `And perils known and unknown will grow as we go on. But we must go on; and it is no
good our delaying the passage of the mountains. Further south there are no passes, till one comes to
the Gap of Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows which side now
the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?'
'Who knows indeed!' said Gandalf. `But there is another way, and not by the pass of Caradhras:
the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.'
'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I beg, not until it is plain that
there is no other way.'
'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf.
'Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and sleep,' said Aragorn.
In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went
aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was
in grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they
returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face the
weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was the other dark and secret
way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it
had been abandoned.

`From signs that we have seen lately,' said Gandalf, 'I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be
watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind. Snow may come. We
must go with all the speed that we can. Even so it will take us more than two marches before we
reach the top of the pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can get
ready.'
'I will add a word of advice, if I may,' said Boromir. 'I was born under the shadow of the White
Mountains and know something of journeys in the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no
worse, before we come down on the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret that we are
frozen to death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, each of us should
carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.'
'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?' said Sam. The pony looked at him
mournfully.
'Very well,' said Gandalf. `But we must not use the wood – not unless it is a choice between fire
and death.'
The Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their way became steep and
difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared, and was blocked
with many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled
among the rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The narrow
path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which the grim flanks of Caradhras
towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly
into a deep ravine.
Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top. Frodo felt a soft
touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve.
They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all the air, and swirling into
Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly
be seen.
'I don't like this at all,' panted Sam just behind. 'Snow's all right on a fine morning, but I like to
be in bed while it's falling. I wish this lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.'
Except on the high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was regarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember the Fell
Winter of 1311, when the white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine.
Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was already ankle-deep about his
boots.
"This is what I feared,' he said. `What do you say now, Aragorn?'
'That I feared it too,' Aragorn answered, `but less than other things. I knew the risk of snow,
though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet;
we are still far down, where the paths are usually open all the winter.'
'I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,' said Boromir. "They say in my land that he can
govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has
strange powers and many allies.'
'His arm has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, `if he can draw snow down from the North to
trouble us here three hundred leagues away.'
'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf.
While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened until it almost ceased.
They tramped on again. But they had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with
fresh fury. The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found
it hard to keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller folk, but it was

plain that they could not go much further, if the snow continued. Frodo's feet felt like lead. Pippin
was dragging behind. Even Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.
The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement without any words being
spoken. They heard eerie noises in the darkness round them. It may have been only a trick of the
wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and wild
howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side, whistling over their heads, or
crashing on the path beside them. Every now and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder
rolled down from hidden heights above.
`We cannot go further tonight,' said Boromir. `Let those call it the wind who will; there are fell
voices on the air; and these stones are aimed at us.'
`I do call it the wind,' said Aragorn. `But that does not make what you say untrue. There are
many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs, and
yet are not in league with Sauron, but have purposes of their own. Some have been in this world
longer than he.'
'Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, `long years ago, when rumour
of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.'
`It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; said Gandalf.
'But what can we do?' cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry and Frodo, and he was
shivering.
`Either stop where we are, or go back,' said Gandalf. 'It is no good going on. Only a little higher,
if I remember rightly, this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of
a long hard slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones – or anything else.'
`And it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said Aragorn. `We have passed no place
on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall we are under now.'
`Shelter!' muttered Sam. `If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof make a house.'
The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. It faced southwards, and
near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that they hoped it would give them some protection from
the northerly wind and from the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every
side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.
They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly
in front of the hobbits, and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow was above his
hocks, and it went on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have
been entirely buried.
A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream.
He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he
heard Bilbo's voice speaking_. I don't think much of your diary_, he said. _Snowstorms on January
the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!_
_But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo_, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself
shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a
nest of snow.
`This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir. `It is useless to sit here until the
snow goes over our heads. We must do something to save ourselves.'
`Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask. `Just a
mouthful each – for all of us. It is very precious. It is _miruvor_, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond
gave it to me at our parting. Pass it round!'
As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of
heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived and found fresh hope and
vigour. But the snow did not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew
louder.

'What do you say to fire?' asked Boromir suddenly. 'The choice seems near now between fire
and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has
covered us, but that will not help us.'
'You may make a fire, if you can,' answered Gandalf. 'If there are any watchers that can endure
this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.' But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the
advice of Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid
the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand. Picking
up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command_, naur an edraith
ammen!_ he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue
flame sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered.
`If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,' he said. 'I have written _Gandalf is
here_ in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.'
But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced to
see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed, and
pools of slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood,
stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red light was on their tired and
anxious faces; behind them the night was like a black wall.
But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.
The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on.
The night is getting old,' said Aragorn. "The dawn is not far off.'
`If any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said Gimli.
Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. 'The snow is growing less,' he
said, `and the wind is quieter.'
Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then
suddenly, as sleep was beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed
fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim light began to grow. At
last the snow stopped altogether.
As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below their refuge were white
humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether
lost; but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow.
Gimli looked up and shook his head. `Caradhras has not forgiven us.' he said. `He has more
snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The sooner we go back and down the better.'
To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only a few
paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits;
in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff.
`If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,' said Legolas.
The storm had troubled him little, and he alone of the Company remained still light of heart.
`If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us,' answered Gandalf. `But
I must have something to work on. I cannot burn snow.'
`Well,' said Boromir, `when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say in my country. The
strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up,
turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us.
If we could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more than a furlong off, I
guess.'
`Then let us force a path thither, you and I!' said Aragorn.
Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in height, was broader and
heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon

toiling heavily. In places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to bc swimming or
burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.
Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then he turned to the others.
`The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for
swimming, and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.'
With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had
long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet
made little imprint in the snow.
'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. `I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a runner over firm sand he
shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, with a wave of his hand he passed them, and
sped into the distance, and vanished round the rocky turn.
The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black
specks in the whiteness. At length they too passed from sight. The time dragged on. The clouds
lowered, and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again.
An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last they saw Legolas coming
back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came
labouring up the slope.
`Well,' cried Legolas as he ran up, `I have not brought the Sun. She is walking in the blue fields
of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have
brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest
wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost buried. They
despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall. And on the other
side the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a
hobbit's toes.'
`Ah, it is as I said,' growled Gimli. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is the ill will of Caradhras. He
does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that drift was laid to cut off our escape.'
'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,' said Boromir, who
came up at that moment. `And doughty Men too, if I may say it; though lesser men with spades
might have served you better. Still, we have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may
be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves.'
`But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the drift?' said Pippin, voicing
the thought of all the hobbits.
'Have hope!' said Boromir. 'I am weary, but I still have some strength left, and Aragorn too. We
will bear the little folk. The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come,
Master Peregrin! I will begin with you.'
He lifted up the hobbit. 'Cling to my back! I shall need my arms' he said and strode forward.
Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at his strength, seeing the passage that he had
already forced with no other tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was
widening the track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went.
They came at length to the great drift. It was flung across the mountain-path like a sheer and
sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of
Boromir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a bridge. On the
far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the
Company to arrive.
After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track
came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying
Frodo. They passed through the lane; but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep
rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the

Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again they saw that the path
was blocked behind them.
`Enough, enough!' cried Gimli. 'We are departing as quickly as we may!' And indeed with that
last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the
invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds
began to break and the light grew broader.
As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went
down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf
at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before.
The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back westwards over the
lower lands. Far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell
from which they had started to climb the pass.
Frodo's legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head was dizzy as he thought
of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but
the black specks remained. In the distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark
dots were circling in the air.
`The birds again!' said Aragorn, pointing down.
'That cannot be helped now,' said Gandalf. `Whether they are good or evil, or have nothing to do
with us at all, we must go down at once. Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for
another night-fall!'
A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the Redhorn Gate, and
stumbled wearily down the slope. Caradhras had defeated them.
_Chapter 4_
A Journey in the Dark
It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they halted for the night. They
were very weary. The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf
spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food
he called a council.
'We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,' he said. `The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired
us out, and we must rest here for a while.'
`And then where are we to go? ' asked Frodo.
'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf. `We have no choice but
to go on, or to return to Rivendell.'
Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell; Merry and Sam
looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign. Frodo looked troubled.
`I wish I was back there,' he said. `But how can I return without shame – unless there is indeed
no other way, and we are already defeated? '
`You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: `to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to
come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain there: we shall not be able to set out again.
Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be
destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the power and
terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master's hand again.'
'Then we must go on, if there is a way,' said Frodo with a sigh. Sam sank back into gloom.
`There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf. `I thought from the beginning, when first I
considered this journey, that we should try it. But it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of
it to the Company before. Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least
been tried.'

`If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil indeed,' said Merry. `But you
had better tell us about it, and let us know the worst at once.'
'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his
head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name.
Even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear:
`The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead through Moria? ' said
Aragorn darkly.
`It is a name of ill omen,' said Boromir. `Nor do I see the need to go there. If we cannot cross the
mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly
to my people, taking the road that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the
Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the sea.'
'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf. 'Did you not hear
what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business of my own ere all is over. But the Ring
must not come near Isengard, if that can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to
us while we go with the Bearer.
'As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a year in such a journey, and
we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe.
The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north,
Boromir, you were in the Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of
small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But you return now as a
member of the Ring's Company, and you are in peril as long as you remain with us. The danger will
increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky.
`Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, I fear. I
see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I
advise that we should go neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a
road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.'
`We do not know what he expects,' said Boromir. `He may watch all roads, likely and unlikely.
In that case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of
the Dark Tower itself. The name of Moria is black.'
`You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,'
answered Gandalf. `I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his
older and lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dûr do not return. But I
would not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there are Orcs there, it
may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or
destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar;
but there is a hope that Moria is still free.
`There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and that in some deep hall of his fathers, Balin
son of Fundin may be found. However it may prove, one must tread the path that need chooses!'
'I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! ' said Gimli. 'I will go and look on the halls of Durin,
whatever may wait there-if you can find the doors that are shut.'
'Good, Gimli! ' said Gandalf. `You encourage me. We will seek the hidden doors together. And
we will come through. In the ruins of the Dwarves, a dwarf's head will be less easy to bewilder than
Elves or Men or Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria. I sought there
long for Thráin son of Thrór after he was lost. I passed through, and I came out again alive! '
`I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,' said Aragorn quietly; 'but though I also came out again, the
memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria a second time.'
'And I don't wish to enter it even once,' said Pippin.
'Nor me,' muttered Sam.
`Of course not! ' said Gandalf. 'Who would? But the question is: who will follow me, if I lead
you there? '

'I will,' said Gimli eagerly.
'I will,' said Aragorn heavily. `You followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow, and have
said no word of blame. I will follow your lead now – if this last warning does not move you. It is
not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to you: if
you pass the doors of Moria, beware! '
`I will _not_ go,' said Boromir; 'not unless the vote of the whole company is against me. What
do Legolas and the little folk say? The Ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard? '
'I do not wish to go to Moria,' said Legolas.
The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. `I do not wish to go,' he
said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until
we have slept on it. Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom.
How the wind howls! '
At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind hissing among the rocks and
trees, and there was a howling and wailing round them in the empty spaces of the night.
Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. 'How the wind howls! ' he cried. 'It is howling with wolfvoices. The Wargs have come west of the Mountains! '
'Need we wait until morning then? ' said Gandalf. `It is as I said. The hunt is up! Even if we live
to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? '
'How far is Moria? ' asked Boromir.
`There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe
twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly.
'Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,' said Boromir. 'The wolf that one
hears is worse than the orc that one fears.'
`True!' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. `But where the warg howls, there also
the orc prowls.'
`I wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam. `I am no good after all. There is
not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don't
ever remember feeling so wretched.'
'My heart's right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But we aren't etten yet, and there are
some stout folk here with us. Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's
belly.'
For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they
had been sheltering. it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken
circle of boulder stones. In the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness and
silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs.
Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill the pony
trembled and sweated where he stood. The howling of the wolves was now all round them,
sometimes nearer and sometimes further off. In the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen
peering over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a gap in the circle
a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from him,
as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault.
Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen, Hound of Sauron! ' he
cried. `Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you
come within this ring.'
The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that moment there was a sharp
twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the
ground; the elvish arrow had pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished.
Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled. All
about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on the sighing wind.

The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting. gleaming fitfully through the
breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep. Without warning a storm of howls broke out
fierce and wild all about the camp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now
attacking them from every side at once.
`Fling fuel on the fire!' cried Gandalf to the hobbits. `Draw your blades, and stand back to back!'
In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the
ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his
sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli
stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was singing.
In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape
like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a
burning branch and strode to meet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed
the blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and his voice rolled like
thunder.
`_Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!_' he cried.
There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding
flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree-top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The
swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air
as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others fled.
Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; a bitter smoke curled above
the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the
sky. Their enemies were routed and did not return.
`What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin? ' said Sam, she/thing his sword. `Wolves won't get him. That
was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed the hair off my head!'
When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be found, and they
looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and
the arrows of Legolas lying on the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point
was left.
`It is as I feared,' said Gandalf. `These were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the
wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!'
That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command of some power that had
no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated from the pass, a power that wished now to
have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind
had been turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The clouds
vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they stood upon the hill-side,
ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain-tops.
`We must reach the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf, 'or I fear we shall not reach them at all. It
is not far, but our path may be winding, for here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in
this country, and only once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago.
`There it lies,' he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the mountains' sides fell sheer
into the shadows at their feet. In the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their
midst, taller than the rest, one great grey wall. `When we left the pass I led you southwards, and not
back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is well that I did so, for now we
have several miles less to cross, and haste is needed. Let us go! '
`I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or
that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught
between wolves and the wall the likeliest chance. Lead on!'
Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard's side, so eager was he to come to Moria. Together they
led the Company back towards the mountains. The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain
along the course of a stream, the Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the

doors had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he
did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start.
The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company wandered and scrambled in a
barren country of red stones. Nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it.
All was bleak and dry. Their hearts sank. They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky;
but what the night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared to think.
Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was standing on a knoll and
pointing to the right. Hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel. It was empty
and silent, and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed;
but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound its way among the
ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad.
'Ah! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. `This is where the stream ran: Sirannon, the Gate-stream,
they used to call it. But what has happened to the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and
noisy. Come! We must hurry on. We are late.'
The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding
track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and began to go west. After a brief halt and a
hasty meal they went on again. Before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep
trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks.
At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been veering southwards
between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and went due east
again. Rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken
and jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that seemed to have been
carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full.
`Indeed things have changed! ' said Gandalf. `But there is no mistaking the place. There is all
that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their
side, but the main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level ground at
the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the Walls of Moria, and the
Sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now! '
They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by
Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way, and
the reason for the drying up of the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled
the cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor
sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the
valley. Beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light:
final and impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the
frowning stone.
`There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the water. `And there the Gate
stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end of the road from Hollin by which we have come.
But this way is blocked. None of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the
end of the day. It has an unwholesome look.'
`We must find a way round the northern edge,' said Gimli. `The first thing for the Company to
do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we
could not get our baggage-pony up this stair.'
`But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,' said Gandalf. `The road under
the mountains is a dark road, and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if
we can.'
`Poor old Bill! ' said Frodo. `I had not thought of that. And poor Sam! I wonder what he will
say? '

`I am sorry,' said Gandalf. `Poor Bill has been a useful companion and it goes to my heart to turn
him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam
is fond of, if I had had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.'
The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset,
when the Company, with all the speed they could, climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the
lake. In breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it
stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its northern end was no more
than half a mile from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and
the water's edge there was a rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or
two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then
he had still to find the doors.
When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred
their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli
strode forward undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at the
edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for under the weedy pools
were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the
touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.
As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side, there came a
soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water.
Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were
widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bubbling noise, and then silence.
The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.
Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could. They
reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen
yards across, and encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the cliff,
and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile southwards along the shore they came
upon holly trees. Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of
old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But close under
the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo
had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming
cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but now they
towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet, standing
like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.
`Well, here we are at last! ' said Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from Hollin ended. Holly was the
token of the people of that land, and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the
West-door was made chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were
happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race, even
between Dwarves and Elves.'
'It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,' said Gimli.
'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,' said Legolas.
'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now. But I beg you two,
Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help me. I need you both. The doors are shut and
hidden, and the sooner we find them the better. Night is at hand! '
Turning to the others he said: 'While I am searching, will you each make ready to enter the
Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell to our good beast of burden. You must lay aside much
of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we
come through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must take a share of what the
pony carried, especially the food and the water-skins.'
'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! ' cried Sam, angry
and distressed. `I won't have it, and that's flat. After he has come so far and all! '

'I am sorry, Sam,' said the wizard. `But when the Door opens I do not think you will be able to
drag your Bill inside, into the long dark of Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your
master.'
'He'd follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon's den, if I led him,' protested Sam. `It'd be nothing short of
murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about.'
'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on the pony's head, and spoke
in a low voice. `Go with words of guard and guiding on you,' he said. `You are a wise beast, and
have learned much in Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come
in time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go.
`There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we
have.'
Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to understand well what
was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to Sam's ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled
with the straps, unlading all the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted
out the goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the rest.
When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have done nothing. He was
standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into
it with his eyes. Gimli was wandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas
was pressed against the rock, as if listening.
'Well, here we are and all ready,' said Merry; `but where are the Doors? I can't see any sign of
them.'
'Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,' said Gimli. `They are invisible, and their own
masters cannot find them or open them, if their secret is forgotten.'
'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said Gandalf, coming
suddenly to life and turning round. `Unless things are altogether changed, eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs.'
He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space,
and over this he passed his hands to and fro, muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped
back.
'Look!' he said. `Can you see anything now?'
The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see nothing else for a while.
Then slowly on the surface, where the wizard's hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender
veins of silver running in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine
that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but steadily they grew broader and
clearer, until their design could be guessed.
At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish
character. Below, though the threads were in places blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of
an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two
trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the
door a single star with many rays.
`There are the emblems of Durin!' cried Gimli.
`And there is the Tree of the High Elves!' said Legolas.
`And the Star of the House of Fëanor,' said Gandalf. `They are wrought of _ithildin_ that mirrors
only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks words now long
forgotten in Middle-earth. It is long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall
them to my mind.'
'What does the writing say?' asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch.
'I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot read these.'

`The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,' answered
Gandalf. 'But they do not say anything of importance to us. They say only: _The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter_. And underneath small and faint is written: _I, Narvi,
made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs._'
`What does it mean by _speak, friend, and enter_?' asked Merry.
'That is plain enough,' said Gimli. `If you are a friend, speak the password, and the doors will
open, and you can enter.'
'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words. Some dwarf-gates will open
only at special times, or for particular persons; and some have locks and keys that are still needed
when all necessary times and words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they
were not secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who
knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so it is recorded, is it not, Gimli? '
'It is,' said the dwarf. `But what the word was is not remembered. Narvi and his craft and all his
kindred have vanished from the earth.'
'But do not _you_ know the word, Gandalf? ' asked Boromir in surprise.
`No! ' said the wizard.
The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent and
unmoved.
'Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?' cried Boromir, glancing back with
a shudder at the dark water. `You told us that you had once passed through the Mines. How could
that be, if you did not know how to enter? '
`The answer to your first question, Boromir,' said the wizard, `is that I do not know the wordyet. But we shall soon see. And,' he added, with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you
may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do
you doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came from the East.
`If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. From the inside you may
thrust them open with your hands. From the outside nothing will move them save the spell of
command. They cannot be forced inwards.'
`What are you going to do then? ' asked Pippin, undaunted by the wizard's bristling brows.
`Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf. `But if that does not shatter
them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will seek for the opening words.
`I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Orcs that was ever used for such a
purpose. I can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mind. But only a few
trials, I think, will be needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret dwarftongue that they teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like the writing on the arch: that
seems certain.'
He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle
beneath the sign of the anvil.
Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!
Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!
he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank grey stone did not stir.
Many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them. Then he tried other
spells. one after another, speaking now faster and louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many
single words of Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless
stars were kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.
Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and
rising wrath. _Edro, edro!_ he cried, and struck the rock with his staff. _Open, open!_ he shouted,

and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of
Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in silence.
At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolves. Bill the
pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him.
'Do not let him run away! ' said Boromir. 'It seems that we shall need him still, if the wolves do
not find us. How I hate this foul pool! ' He stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into
the dark water.
The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was a swish and a bubble.
Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen, and they moved
slowly towards the foot of the cliff.
'Why did you do that, Boromir? ' said Frodo. `I hate this place, too, and I am afraid. I don't know
of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool.
Don't disturb it! '
'l wish we could get away! ' said Merry.
'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? ' said Pippin.
Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in despair or in anxious
thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard again. The ripples on the water grew and
came closer; some were already lapping on the shore.
With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. He was laughing! `I have
it! ' he cried. 'Of course, of course! Absurdly simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.'
Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice: _Mellon!_
The star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great doorway was outlined, though
not a crack or joint had been visible before. Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards
inch by inch, until both doors lay back against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could
be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night.
The Company stared in wonder.
`I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too. Merry, of all people, was on the right track.
The opening word was inscribed on the archway all the time! The translation should have been:
_Say "Friend" and enter._ I had only to speak the Elvish word for _friend_ and the doors opened.
Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. Those were happier
times. Now let us go!'
He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that moment several things
happened. Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle, and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a
wild neigh of fear, and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam
leaped after him, and then hearing Frodo's cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing. The others
swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host of snakes were swimming up from
the southern end.
Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was pale-green and luminous and
wet. Its fingered end had hold of Frodo's foot and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his
knees was now slashing at it with a knife.
The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. Twenty others arms
came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a hideous stench.
`Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick! ' shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing them from the
horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where they stood, he drove them
forward.
They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to
climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and
the doors. One came wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned and
paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from within, there was no
need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side, and with horrible strength, swung them

round. With a shattering echo they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing
came dully through the ponderous stone.
Sam, clinging to Frodo's arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness. `Poor old Bill! ' he said
in a choking voice. `Poor old Bill! Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had
to choose, Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.'
They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors. There was a
quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the doors did not open. `Well, well! ' said the
wizard. `The passage is blocked behind us now and there is only one way out–on the other side of
the mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees uprooted and
thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were beautiful, and had stood so long.'
`I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water,'
said Frodo. 'What was the thing, or were there many of them? '
'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one purpose. Something has
crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains. There are older and fouler things
than Orcs in the deep places of the world.' He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was
that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company.
Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse
whisper that all could hear: `In the deep places of the world! And thither we are going against my
wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly dark? '
'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff! '
As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff aloft, and from its tip there
came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they
counted, broad and shallow; and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading
on into the dark.
`Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, since we can't find a diningroom! ' said Frodo. He had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt
extremely hungry.
The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, dim figures in the
gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.
`It will not last much longer, I am afraid,' he said; 'but I think we need it after that horror at the
gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go
carefully with the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they should not
be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into
Dimrill Dale.'
'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo.
'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf. 'It depends on many chances. But going straight, without
mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty
miles from West-door to East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.'
After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager to get the journey over as
quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours.
Gandalf walked in front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light of
which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him
came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the
dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of
Sting or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder
Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam,
and after him Legolas, and the young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent,
walked Aragorn.
The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It went steadily down for a
long while before it became level once again. The air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and

at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in the
walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard's staff, Frodo caught glimpses of
stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or
opening blankly dark on either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.
Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least he was not, as were most of
the others, troubled by the mere darkness in itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where
the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of
Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Glóin's son, dwarf of the mountainrace though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little
help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go,
and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.
`Do not be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli
were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously. `Do not be afraid! I
have been with him on many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of
greater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if there is any path to find. He
has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is
surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Berúthiel.'
It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no fuel nor any means of
making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind. But
without any light they would soon have come to grief. There were not only many roads to choose
from, there were also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in which
their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now and
then a crack would open right before their feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it
was long before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. The noise of
churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in the depths.
`Rope! ' muttered Sam. `I knew I'd want it, if I hadn't got it! '
As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed to
have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet
there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits had risen for a while
after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to
dread, crept over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim
wound had not been without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could
not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark
than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any case the bearer of the Ring:
it hung upon its chain against his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the
certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on the hilt of
his sword and went on doggedly.
The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. There was no sound
but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir;
the light step of Legolas; the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all,
unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to
imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud enough,
or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped,
while the Company was moving. But it was not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a
little all by itself, and then grew still.
It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been going for several hours
with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark
arch opening into three passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand

passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on,
smooth and level but very narrow.
'I have no memory of this place at all! ' said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch. He
held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice; but
nothing of the kind was to be seen. `I am too weary to decide,' he said, shaking his head. `And I
expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt here for what is left of the
night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward
and the middle-night has passed.'
`Poor old Bill! ' said Sam. 'I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves haven't got him yet.'
To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half closed, but swung back easily to
a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock.
`Steady! Steady! ' cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where
they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage. `Steady! You do not
know what is inside yet. I will go first.'
He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. `There! ' he said, pointing with his staff to the
middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken
and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near.
'One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the
bottom,' said Aragorn to Merry. 'Let the guide go first while you have one.'
'This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the three passages,' said Gimli.
`That hole was plainly a well for the guards' use, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and
we must all take care in the dark.'
Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were unrolling blankets and making
beds against the walls of the chamber, as far as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the
edge and peered over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths. Moved by a
sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He felt his heart beat many times before
there was any sound. Then far below, as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous
place, there came a _plunk_, very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft.
`What's that? ' cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done; but he
was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting. 'Fool of a Took! ' he growled. 'This is a serious
journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further
nuisance. Now be quiet! '
Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of the depths faint knocks:
_tom-tap, tap-tom_. They stopped, and when the echoes had died away, they were repeated: _taptom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom_. They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while
the knocking died away and was not heard again.
'That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,' said Gimli.
`Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do with Peregrin's foolish stone;
but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing
of the kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can go
on the first watch, as a reward,' he growled, as he rolled himself in a blanket.
Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round, fearing that
some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only
with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.
Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep in thought, trying to
recall every memory of his former journey in the Mines, and considering anxiously the next course
that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over to
Pippin.
`Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone. 'You want to sleep, I
expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the watching.'

'I know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the door. 'I need smoke! I
have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm.'
The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled
on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a
moment showed his sharp nose. and the puff of smoke.
It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched all alone for about six
hours, and had let the others rest. `And in the watches I have made up my mind,' he said. `I do not
like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air
down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up
again.'
For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; and they met no danger, and
heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-thewisp in front of them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they could
judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no
openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits
or cracks. Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward
quicker than they had done on their first march.
In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line east, though they must
have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the road climbed upwards` Frodo's spirits rose a
little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the
Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo.
They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and all were thinking of a
place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished. They seemed to
have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught
of warmer air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They halted and
crowded anxiously together.
Gandalf seemed pleased. `I chose the right way,' he said. `At last we are coming to the habitable
parts, and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal
higher than the Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide
hall. I will now risk a little real light.'
He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a flash of lightning. Great
shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by
many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its
black walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other entrances they saw,
dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, and one on either side. Then the light went
out.
`That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf. 'There used to be great windows
on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think
we have reached them now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I am
right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the meanwhile we had better
go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark
road is over. But we are not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the
world.'
The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a corner to
escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All
about them as they lay hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the
loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages. The wildest
imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual
dread and wonder of Moria.

`There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said Sam; `and every one
of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all this, and most in hard rock too!
What did they do it all for? They didn't live in these darksome holes surely? '
`These are not holes,' said Gimli. `This is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf. And of
old it was not darksome, but full of light and splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.'
He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, while the echoes ran away
into the roof.
The world was young, the mountains green,
No stain yet on the Moon was seen,
No words were laid on stream or stone
When Durin woke and walked alone.
He named the nameless hills and dells;
He drank from yet untasted wells;
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,
And saw a crown of stars appear,
As gems upon a silver thread,
Above the shadow of his head.
The world was fair, the mountains tall,
In Elder Days before the fall
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond
And Gondolin, who now beyond
The Western Seas have passed away:
The world was fair in Durin's Day.
A king he was on carven throne
In many-pillared halls of stone
With golden roof and silver floor,
And runes of power upon the door.
The light of sun and star and moon
In shining lamps of crystal hewn
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night
There shone for ever fair and bright.
There hammer on the anvil smote,
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;
The delver mined, the mason built.
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,
And metal wrought like fishes' mail,
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
And shining spears were laid in hoard.
Unwearied then were Durin's folk
Beneath the mountains music woke:
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,
And at the gates the trumpets rang.
The world is grey, the mountains old,

The forge's fire is ashen-cold
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls
The shadow lies upon his tomb
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.
But still the sunken stars appear
In dark and windless Mirrormere;
There lies his crown in water deep,
Till Durin wakes again from sleep.
`I like that! ' said Sam. `I should like to learn it. _In Moria, in Khazad-dûm!_ But it makes the
darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about
here still? '
Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.
`Piles of jewels? ' said Gandalf. `No. The Orcs have often plundered Moria; there is nothing left
in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down
in the deep places: they are drowned in water–or in a shadow of fear.'
`Then what do the dwarves want to come back for? ' asked Sam.
'For _mithril_,' answered Gandalf. `The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels, the toys of
the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things they found here, it is true, especially iron; but
they did not need to delve for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For here
alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called it: _mithril_ is the
Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold,
and now it is beyond price; for little is left above ground, and even the Orcs dare not delve here for
it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The Dwarves tell no tale;
but even as _mithril_ was the foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they
delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin's Bane. Of what
they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets
it.
`_Mithril!_ All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the
Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to
that of common silver, but the beauty of _mithril_ did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly
loved it, and among many uses they made of it _ithildin_, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors.
Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become of it?
Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.'
`What? ' cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. `A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly
gift! '
'Yes,' said Gandalf. `I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire
and everything in it.'
Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his mail-shirt.
He felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the Shire under his
jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift.
But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to Bilbo, and to
Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there,
and in those days, mowing the lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of
Moria, or _mithril -_or the Ring.
A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on guard. As if it were a breath
that came in through unseen doors out of deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold
and his brow damp. He listened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow
hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall.

His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the western archway stood, he
fancied that he could see two pale points of light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head
had nodded. `I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard,' he thought. `I was on the edge of a dream.'
He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into the dark, until he was
relieved by Legolas.
When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that the dream went on: he
heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light approaching, slowly. He woke and found that
the others were speaking softly near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up
above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and across the hall
through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly.
Frodo sat up. `Good morning! ' said Gandalf: `For morning it is again at last. I was right, you
see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. Before today is over we ought to find the Great
Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.'
'I shall be glad,' said Gimli. `I have looked on Moria, and it is very great, but it has become dark
and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.'
After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. `We are tired, but we shall
rest better when we are outside,' he said. `I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in
Moria.'
`No indeed! ' said Boromir. `Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch? '
'Maybe,' said Gandalf. `But I du not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I
guess that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right
road down to them. The eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but
before we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light in the north
door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes only down deep
shafts.'
Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They found themselves in a
wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it came through
a doorway on their right. It was high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges,
standing half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after
so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as they entered.
Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among things lying in the doorway
whose shapes they could not at first make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the
further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be
seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block,
about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.
`It looks like a tomb,' muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to
look more closely at it. Gandalf came quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:
'These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,' said Gandalf. 'Here is written in
the tongues of Men and Dwarves:
BALIN SON OF FUNDIN
LORD OF MORIA.'
'He is dead then,' said Frodo. `I feared it was so.' Gimli cast his hood over his face.
_Chapter 5_
The Bridge of Khazad-dûm

The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo thought of Bilbo and his
long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin's visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in
the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world.
At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything that would give them
tidings of Balin's fate, or show what had become of his folk. There was another smaller door on the
other side of the chamber, under the shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones
were lying, and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and helms.
Some of the swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.
There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were large iron-bound chests
of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the
remains of a book. It had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with
black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf lifted it carefully,
but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for some time without
speaking. Frodo and Gimli standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they
were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, and here and there in
Elvish script.
At last Gandalf looked up. 'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balin's folk,' he said. `I
guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to
have numbers referring to the years after their arrival. The top page is marked _one – three_, so at
least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this!
'_We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard_ – I think; the next word is blurred and
burned; probably _room_ – _we slew many in the bright_ – I think – _sun in the dale. Flói was
killed by an arrow. He slew the great_. Then there is a blur followed by _Flói under grass near
Mirror mere_. The next line or two I cannot read. Then comes _We have taken the twentyfirst hall
of North end to dwell in. There is_I cannot read what. A _shaft_ is mentioned. Then _Balin has set
up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul_.'
'The Chamber of Records,' said Gimli. `I guess that is where we now stand.'
`Well, I can read no more for a long way,' said Gandalf, 'except the word _gold_, and _Durin's
Axe_ and something _helm_. Then _Balin is now lord of Moria_. That seems to end a chapter.
After some stars another hand begins, and I can see _we found truesilver_, and later the word
_wellforged_ and then something, I have it! _mithril_; and the last two lines _Óin to seek for the
upper armouries of Third Deep_, something _go westwards_, a blur,_ to Hollin gate_.'
Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. 'There are several pages of the same sort, rather
hastily written and much damaged, he said; `but I can make little of them in this light. Now there
must be a number of leaves missing, because they begin to be numbered _five_, the fifth year of the
colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot read them. We might do
better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large bold hand using an Elvish script.'
'That would be Ori's hand,' said Gimli, looking over the wizard's arm. `He could write well and
speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.'
`I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,' said Gandalf. 'The first clear word is _sorrow_,
but the rest of the line is lost, unless it ends in _estre_. Yes, it must be _yestre_ followed by _day
being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in
Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc, hut many more ... up from east
up the Silverlode_. The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but
I think I can read_ we have barred the gates_, and then _can hold them long if_, and then perhaps
_horrible_ and _suffer_. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for less than five
years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages.
Here is the last page of all.' He paused and sighed.

`It is grim reading,' he said. 'I fear their end was cruel. Listen! _We cannot get out. We cannot
get out. They have taken the Bridge and second hall. Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there_. Then there
are four lines smeared so that I can only _read went 5 days ago_. The last lines _run the pool is up
to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin. We cannot get out. The end comes_,
and then_ drums, drums in the deep_. I wonder what that means. The last thing written is in a
trailing scrawl of elf-letters: _they are coming_. There is nothing more.' Gandalf paused and stood
in silent thought.
A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. `_We cannot get out_,'
muttered Gimli. 'It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping
down at the southern end.'
Gandalf raised his head and looked round. `They seem to have made a last stand by both doors,'
he said; 'but there were not many left by that time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was
valiant but foolish. The time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of
Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this book, the Book of Mazarbul,
and look at it more closely later. You had better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dáin, if you get a
chance. It will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The morning is
passing.'
'Which way shall we go? ' asked Boromir.
'Back to the hall,' answered Gandalf. 'But our visit to this room has not been in vain. I now know
where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the
twenty-first of the North-end. Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear
right and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh Level, that is
six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall! '
Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling _Boom_ that
seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in the stone at their feet. They sprang
towards the door in alarm. _Doom, doom_ it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very
caverns of Moria into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown in the
hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound of
many feet.
`They are coming! ' cried Legolas.
'We cannot get out,' said Gimli.
`Trapped! ' cried Gandalf. `Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just as they were before. But I
was not here then. We will see what –––-'
_Doom, doom_ came the drum-beat and the walls shook.
'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted Aragorn. 'And keep your packs on as long as you
can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.'
`No! ' said Gandalf. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! We will go that way, if
we get a chance.'
Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming down the corridor. There
was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and
Sting glinted at the edges. Boromir set his shoulder against the western door.
`Wait a moment! Do not close it yet! ' said Gandalf. He sprang forward to Boromir's side and
drew himself up to his full height.
'Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria? ' he cried in a loud voice.
There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones into a pit; amid the clamour a
deep voice was raised in command. Doom, boom, doom went the drums in the deep.
With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust
forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside. For an
instant the wizard looked out. Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back.

'There are Orcs, very many of them,' he said. `And some are large and evil: black Uruks of
Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there is something else there. A great cavetroll, I think, or more than one. There is no hope of escape that way.'
'And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,' said Boromir.
'There is no sound outside here yet,' said Aragorn, who was standing by the eastern door
listening. `The passage on this side plunges straight down a stair: it plainly does not lead back
towards the hall. But it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot
block the door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must do something
to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of Mazarbul!' he said grimly feeling
the edge of his sword, Andúril.
Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to;
then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the
other side of the chamber. But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that
made it quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A huge arm and
shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust through the widening gap. Then a great,
flat, toeless foot was forced through below. There was a dead silence outside.
Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his sword rang, glanced
aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was notched.
Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart. `The Shire! ' he
cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped, and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There
was a bellow, and the foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm. Black drops
dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the door and
slammed it again.
`One for the Shire! ' cried Aragorn. `The hobbit's bite is deep! You have a good blade, Frodo son
of Drogo! '
There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and hammers were beating
against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came
whistling in, but struck the northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was a horn-blast
and a rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber.
How many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp, but the orcs were
dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. Legolas shot two through the throat. Gimli hewed the
legs from under another that had sprung up on Balin's tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many.
When thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking. leaving the defenders unharmed, except for Sam
who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he had felled his orc: a sturdy
thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted
Sandyman step backwards, if he had seen it.
`Now is the time! ' cried Gandalf. `Let us go, before the troll returns!'
But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside, a huge
orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber;
behind him his followers clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like
coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of his huge hide shield he
turned Boromir's sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under
Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his
spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the
wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it broke. But even as the orc flung
down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar, Andúril came down upon his helm. There was a
flash like flame and the helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled
howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.
_Doom, doom_ went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out again.

'Now! ' shouted Gandalf. 'Now is the last chance. Run for it! '
Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair, pushing Merry and
Pippin in front of him. The others followed; but Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite
of the peril he lingered by Balin's tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door to,
grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could not be fastened.
'I am all right,' gasped Frodo. `I can walk. Put me down! '
Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. 'I thought you were dead! ' he cried.
'Not yet! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is time for wonder. Off you go, all of you, down the stairs!
Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose
paths leading right and downwards.'
'We cannot leave you to hold the door alone! ' said Aragorn.
`Do as I say! ' said Gandalf fiercely. `Swords are no more use here. Go!'
The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their way down a long flight
of steps, and then looked back; but they could see nothing, except high above them the faint
glimmer of the wizard's staff. He seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo
breathed heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood peering up the
stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words
that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls
seemed to be trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: _doom, doom_.
Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then there was a dull rumble and
a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: _doom-boom, doom-boom_, and then stopped.
Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company.
`Well, well! That's over! ' said the wizard struggling to his feet. `I have done all that I could. But
I have met my match, and have nearly been destroyed. But don't stand here! Go on! You will have
to do without light for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come
ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!'
They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. _Doom, doom_ went the drum-beats
again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were following. There was no other sound
of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage
seemed to be going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended a flight of
steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was their chief danger; for in the dark they
could not see a descent, until they came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the
ground with his staff like a blind man.
At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and had descended many
flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit. Almost they began to hope that they would
escape. At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.
`It is getting hot! ' he gasped. `We ought to be down at least to the level of the Gates now. Soon
I think we should look for a left-hand turn to take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I
must rest here a moment, even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us.'
Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. `What happened away up there at
the door? ' he asked. `Did you meet the beater of the drums? '
'I do not know,' answered Gandalf. `But I found myself suddenly faced by something that I have
not met before. I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting-spell on the door. I know
many; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by
strength.
`As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought they would
burst it open. I could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous
language. All I caught was _ghâsh;_ that is "fire". Then something came into the chamber – I felt it

through the door, and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the iron ring,
and then it perceived me and my spell.
'What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell was
terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door left my control and began to open! I had to
speak a word of Command. That proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something
dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down the stairs.
All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I think.
`I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried there too. I cannot say.
But at least the passage behind us was completely blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is
passing. And now what about you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been
more delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that
Aragorn was carrying.'
`What about me? ' said Frodo. 'I am alive, and whole I think. I am bruised and in pain, but it is
not too bad.'
`Well,' said Aragorn, `I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never
met the like of it. Had I known, I would have spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust
would have skewered a wild boar! '
'Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,' said Frodo; `though I feel as if I had been caught
between a hammer and an anvil.' He said no more. He found breathing painful.
'You take after Bilbo,' said Gandalf. `There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of
him long ago.' Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said.
They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in the dark. `I think,' he
said, `that there is a light ahead. But it is not daylight. It is red. What can it be? '
`_Ghâsh!_' muttered Gandalf. `I wonder if that is what they meant: that the lower levels are on
fire? Still, we can only go on.'
Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was flickering and glowing on
the walls away down the passage before them. They could now see their way: in front the road
sloped down swiftly, and some way ahead there stood a low archway; through it the glowing light
came. The air became very hot.
When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to wait. As he stood just
beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.
`There is some new devilry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome no doubt. But I know now
where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the level immediately below the Gates. This is the
Second Hall of Old Moria; and the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not
more than a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road through the
First Hall, and out! But come and look! '
They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier and far longer than the
one in which they had slept. They were near its eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness.
Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty
trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems were smooth and
black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across the floor, close to the feet of
two huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again
flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps of dark smoke wavered
in the hot air.
'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been trapped here,'
said Gandalf. `Let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to
lose.'

Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: _Doom, doom, doom_. Away
beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horn-calls. _Doom, doom_:
the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver.
`Now for the last race! ' said Gandalf. 'If the sun is shining outside we may still escape. After
me! '
He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The distance was greater than it had
looked. As they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went
up: they had been seen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo's head.
Boromir laughed. `They did not expect this,' he said. `The fire has cut them off. We are on the
wrong side! '
`Look ahead! ' called Gandalf. `The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and narrow.'
Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell
to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone, without
kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence
of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer passages. They
could only pass across it in single file. At the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack
behind.
'Lead the way, Gimli! ' he said. 'Pippin and Merry next. Straight on and up the stair beyond the
door! '
Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf's hat and
stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black
figures: there seemed to be hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red
as blood in the firelight. _Doom, doom_ rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and louder, _doom,
doom_.
Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long shot for his small bow. He
drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two
great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways
over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror. The ranks of the orcs had
opened, and they crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was coming up
behind them. What it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was
a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go
before it.
It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush
it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black
smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a
blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.
'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! '
Gimli stared with wide eyes. `Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and letting his axe fall he covered his
face.
'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf. `Now I understand.' He faltered and leaned heavily on his staff.
`What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.'
The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled and poured over the
stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn and blew. Loud the challenge rang and bellowed,
like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. For a moment the orcs quailed and the
fiery shadow halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind, and
the enemy advanced again.
'Over the bridge!' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. `Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I
must hold the narrow way. Fly! ' Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command, but still held

their ground, side by side, behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within
the doorway at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone.
The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in
his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again,
facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the
thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.
`You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. `I am a servant of the
Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame
of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'
The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped
forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were
spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed
small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.
From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.
Glamdring glittered white in answer.
There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in
molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood
still.
'You cannot pass! ' he said.
With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.
'He cannot stand alone! ' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. '_Elendil!_' he
shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf! '
`Gondor! ' cried Boromir and leaped after him.
At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The
staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge
cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf,
while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.
With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But
even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees,
dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the
abyss. 'Fly, you fools! ' he cried, and was gone.
The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted with horror staring into
the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell.
With a cry Aragorn roused them.
'Come! I will lead you now! ' he called. 'We must obey his last command. Follow me! '
They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. Aragorn leading, Boromir at the rear.
At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping,
and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran. _Doom, doom, doom_ the drum-beats
rolled behind, mournful now and slow; _doom!_
They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. They ran swifter. They
passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its high windows in the east. They fled across it.
Through its huge broken doors they passed, and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an
arch of blazing light.
There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door posts towering on
either side, but the gates were shattered and cast down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain
that stood in his path, and the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and
took no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn steps, the
threshold of Moria.
Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces.

They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them.
The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it, but eastwards there was a golden light on the land.
It was but one hour after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high.
They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the mountain-shadow. Faint
and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats: _doom_. A thin black smoke trailed out.
Nothing else was to be seen; the dale all around was empty. _Doom_. Grief at last wholly
overcame them, and they wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. _Doom,
doom_. The drum-beats faded.
_Chapter 6_
Lothlórien
'Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,' said Aragorn. He looked towards the mountains and
held up his sword. `Farewell, Gandalf! ' he cried. 'Did I not say to you: _if you pass the doors of
Moria, beware_? Alas that I spoke true! What hope have we without you? '
He turned to the Company. `We must do without hope,' he said. `At least we may yet be
avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We have a long road, and much to do.'
They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between
two great arms of the mountains, above which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol,
Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria. At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over
an endless ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains' feet.
`Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,' said Aragorn, pointing to the falls. 'Down the deep-cloven way that
climbs beside the torrent we should have come, if fortune had been kinder.'
`Or Caradhras less cruel,' said Gimli. `There he stands smiling in the sun! ' He shook his fist at
the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned away.
To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, and far lands could be
descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far
as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on
the west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head
thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit
sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face
was still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides to its bare
unbroken rim.
`There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zâram! ' said Gimli sadly. `I remember that he said:
"May you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger there." Now long shall I journey ere I have
joy again. It is I that must hasten away, and he that must remain.'
The Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and broken, fading to a
winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones. But still it could be
seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the Dwarfkingdom. In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green topped
with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward bend led them hard by the sward
of Mirrormere, and there not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top.
'That is Durin's Stone! ' cried Gimli. `I cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to look at
the wonder of the dale! '
`Be swift then! ' said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. `The Sun sinks early. The Orcs
will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is
almost spent, and it will be dark tonight.'

'Come with me, Frodo! ' cried the dwarf, springing from the road. `I would not have you go
without seeing Kheled-zâram.' He ran down the long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by
the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind.
Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked and weather-worn, and the
faint runes upon its side could not be read. `This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in
the Mirrormere,' said the dwarf. 'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!'
They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then slowly they saw the
forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue, and the peaks were like plumes of
white flame above them; beyond there was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone
glinting stars, though sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow could
be seen.
'O Kheled-zâram fair and wonderful! ' said Gimli. `There lies the Crown of Durin till he wakes.
Farewell! ' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened back up the green-sward to the road again.
`What did you see? ' said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in thought to answer.
The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from between the arms of
the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep well of water, clear as crystal, from which
a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel.
'Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises.' said Gimli. `Do not drink of it! It is icy cold.'
'Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other mountain-streams,' said
Aragorn. `Our road leads beside it for many miles. For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf
chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out
yonder.' They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the
trough of the valley, and then running on and away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden
haze.
`There lie the woods of Lothlórien! ' said Legolas. `That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my
people. There are no trees like the trees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn
to gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are
laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its
pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say.
My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime! '
`My heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said Aragorn. 'But it lies many miles away. Let us
hasten! '
For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but Aragorn was leading
them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged behind. They had eaten nothing since the early
morning. Sam's cut was burning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the wind
seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful and
he gasped for breath.
At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to Aragorn. The others halted,
and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come with him.
'I am sorry, Frodo! ' he cried, full of concern. `So much has happened this day and we have such
need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We
have done nothing to ease you, as we ought, though all the orcs of Moria were after us. Come now!
A little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do what I can for you.
Come, Boromir! We will carry them.'
Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west, and joined its
bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone,
and foamed down into a dell. About it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and
clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle-berry. At the bottom there was a level space
through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly

three hours after noon, and they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was
westering.
While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water,
Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam's wound was not deep, but it looked ugly, and Aragorn's face
was grave as he examined it. After a moment he looked up with relief.
'Good luck, Sam! ' he said. 'Many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of
their first orc. The cut is not poisoned, as the wounds of orc-blades too often are. It should heal well
when I have tended it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.'
He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. `They are dry and some of their virtue
has one, he said, but here I have still some of the leaves of _athelas_ that I gathered near
Weathertop. Crush one in the water, and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your
turn. Frodo! '
'I am all right,' said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. `AII I needed was some food
and a little rest.'
`No! ' said Aragorn. `We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to
you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.' Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic,
and gave a gasp of wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the
light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and the gems on it glittered like
stars. and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool.
`Look, my friends!' he called. `Here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an elven-princeling in! If it
were known that hobbits had such hides, all the hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the
Shire.'
`And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,' said Gimli, gazing at the
mail in wonder. `It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the
coat that Gandalf spoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given! '
`I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his little room,' said Merry.
'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. I hope we get a chance of telling him about it! '
There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast. Under the mail there
was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh.
Frodo's left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the
others set the food ready. Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped. The
pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed
and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff
and sore to the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side.
`The mail is marvellously light,' he said. `Put it on again, if you can bear it. My heart is glad to
know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where
you are safe for a while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.'
When they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the fire and hid all traces of
it. Then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again. They had not gone far before the sun
sank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk veiled
their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim
lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able
to go at a fair pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly three more
hours.
It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut the fast-waning moon
would not be seen till late. Gimli and Frodo were at the rear, walking softly and not speaking,
listening for any sound upon the road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence.
'Not a sound but the wind,' he said. `There are no goblins near, or my ears are made of wood. It
is to be hoped that the Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all

their purpose, and they had nothing else to do with us-with the Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue
foes for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.'
Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet he had heard something,
or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim, he
had heard again the quick patter of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two
tiny gleams of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they slipped aside
and vanished.
`What is it? ' said the dwarf.
`I don't know.' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet, and I thought I saw a light-like eyes. I
have thought so often, since we first entered Moria.'
Gimli halted and stooped to the ground. 'I hear nothing but the night-speech of plant and stone,'
he said. 'Come! Let us hurry! The others are out of sight.'
The night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a wide grey shadow loomed,
and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze.
`Lothlórien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlórien! We have come to the eaves of the Golden Wood. Alas
that it is winter! '
Under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road and stream that ran
suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim light of the stars their stems were grey, and
their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold.
'Lothlórien! ' said Aragorn. 'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the trees! We are still little more
than five leagues from the Gates, but we can go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the
Elves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind.'
`If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said Gimli.
'It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in
ages long ago,' said Legolas, 'but we hear that Lórien is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power
here that holds evil from the land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now
deep in the woods and far from the northern border.'
'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as if some memory stirred in
him. `We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go forward a short way, until the trees are all
about us, and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.'
He stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. 'Is there no other way? ' he
said.
`What other fairer way would you desire? ' said Aragorn.
`A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,' said Boromir. `By strange paths has this
Company been led, and so far to evil fortune. Against my will we passed under the shades of
Moria, to our loss. And now we must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we
have heard in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few none have
escaped unscathed.'
`Say not _unscathed_, but if you say _unchanged_, then maybe you will speak the truth said
Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of those who once were wise they now
speak evil of Lothlórien. Believe what you will, there is no other way for us – unless you would go
back to Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all alone.'
`Then lead on! ' said Boromir. `But it is perilous.'
`Perilous indeed,' said Aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need fear it, or those who bring
some evil with them. Follow me! '
They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream
flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains.
They heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right. Its dark hurrying waters
ran across the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots
of trees.

`Here is Nimrodel! ' said Legolas. 'Of this stream the Silvan Elves made many songs long ago,
and still we sing them in the North, remembering the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers
that floated in its foam. All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe
my feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.' He went forward and climbed down the
deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream.
`Follow me!' he cried. 'The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On the further bank we can
rest. and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.'
One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo stood near the brink
and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold but its touch was clean, and as he went on and
it mounted to his knees, he felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs.
When all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little food; and Legolas told
them tales of Lothlórien that the Elves of Mirkwood still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and
starlight upon the meadows by the Great River before the world was grey.
At length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the
shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing, mingled with the sound of the
water.
`Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? ' asked Legolas. 'I will sing you a song of the maiden
Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived lung ago. It is a fair song
in our woodland tongue; but this is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now
sing it.' In a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began:
An Elven-maid there was of old,
A shining star by day:
Her mantle white was hemmed with gold,
Her shoes of silver-grey.
A star was bound upon her brows,
A light was on her hair
As sun upon the golden boughs
In Lórien the fair.
Her hair was long, her limbs were white,
And fair she was and free;
And in the wind she went as light
As leaf of linden-tree.
Beside the falls of Nimrodel,
By water clear and cool,
Her voice as falling silver fell
Into the shining pool.
Where now she wanders none can tell,
In sunlight or in shade;
For lost of yore was Nimrodel
And in the mountains strayed.
The elven-ship in haven grey
Beneath the mountain-lee
Awaited her for many a day
Beside the roaring sea.

A wind by night in Northern lands
Arose, and loud it cried,
And drove the ship from elven-strands
Across the streaming tide.
When dawn came dim the land was lost,
The mountains sinking grey
Beyond the heaving waves that tossed
Their plumes of blinding spray.
Amroth beheld the fading shore
Now low beyond the swell,
And cursed the faithless ship that bore
Him far from Nimrodel.
Of old he was an Elven-king,
A lord of tree and glen,
When golden were the boughs in spring
In fair Lothlórien.
From helm to sea they saw him leap,
As arrow from the string,
And dive into the water deep,
As mew upon the wing.
The wind was in his flowing hair,
The foam about him shone;
Afar they saw him strong and fair
Go riding like a swan.
But from the West has come no word,
And on the Hither Shore
No tidings Elven-folk have heard
Of Amroth evermore.
The voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. 'I cannot sing any more,' he said. 'That is but
a part, for I have forgotten much. It is long and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlórien,
Lórien of the Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains.'
`But the Dwarves did not make the evil,' said Gimli.
`I said not so; yet evil came,' answered Legolas sadly. `Then many of the Elves of Nimrodel's
kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the South, in the passes of the
White Mountains; and she came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the
spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that
bear her name. And when the wind is in the South the voice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for
Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great. and
Anduin flows into the Bay of Belfalas whence the Elves of Lórien set sail. But neither Nimrodel
nor Amroth ever came back.
'It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls; for that was
the custom of the Elves of Lórien, to dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were

called the Galadhrim, the Tree-people. Deep in their forest the trees are very great. The people of
the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build strong places of stone before the
Shadow came.'
`And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than sitting on the
ground,' said Gimli. He looked across the stream to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then
up into the roof of dark boughs above.
`Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,' said Aragorn. `We cannot build a house, but tonight we
will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the
road already longer than was wise.'
The Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of the deeper woods,
westward along the mountain-stream away from Silverlode. Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they
found a cluster of trees, some of which overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of
mighty girth, but their height could not be guessed.
`I will climb up,' said Legolas. `I am at home among trees, by root or bough, though these trees
are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in song. _Mellyrn_ they are called, and are those that
bear the yellow blossom, but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape and
way of growth.'
`Whatever it may be,' said Pippin, `they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest
at night, except to birds. I cannot sleep on a perch! '
'Then dig a hole in the ground,' said Legolas, `if that is more after the fashion of your kind. But
you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to hide from Orcs.' He sprang lightly up from the ground
and caught a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for a
moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him.
`_Daro!_' it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth in surprise and fear.
He shrank against the bole of the tree.
'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. `Do not move or speak! '
There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another clear voice spoke in an
elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk
east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and
answered in the same language.
`Who are they, and what do they say? ' asked Merry.
`They're Elves,' said Sam. `Can't you hear their voices? '
`Yes, they are Elves,' said Legolas; `and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot
you in the dark.' Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth. 'But they say also that you need have no
fear. They have been aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and
knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not hinder our crossing; and
afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had
some tidings of him and of our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the
foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.'
Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, silver-grey and glimmering in
the dark, and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran
lightly up, and Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches
of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top
the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had
been built a wooden platform, or _flet_ as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it
a _talan_. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed.
When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves. They
were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen among the tree-stems, unless they moved
suddenly. They stood up, and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver

beam. He held it up, looking at Frodo's face, and Sam's. Then he shut off the light again, and spoke
words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.
`Welcome!' the Elf then said again in the Common Language, speaking slowly. 'We seldom use
any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart of the forest, and do not willingly have
dealings with any other folk. Even our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there
are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies, and
they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my name. My brothers, Rúmil and
Orophin, speak little of your tongue.
`But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond passed by Lórien on
their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of hobbits, or halflings, for many a long
year, and did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you
come with an Elf of our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it is not
our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here tonight. How many are you? '
`Eight,' said Legolas. `Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, Aragorn, is an Elffriend of the folk of Westernesse.'
`The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lórien,' said Haldir, `and he has the favour
of the Lady. All then is well. But you have yet spoken only of seven.'
`The eighth is a dwarf,' said Legolas.
`A dwarf! ' said Haldir. `That is not well. We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the
Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I cannot allow him to pass.'
`But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Dáin's trusty people, and friendly to Elrond,' said
Frodo. `Elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions, and he has been brave and faithful.'
The Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas in their own tongue. 'Very
good,' said Haldir at last. `We will do this, though it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas
will guard him, and answer for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlórien.
`But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the ground. We have been
keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great troop of Orcs going north toward Moria,
along the skirts of the mountains, many days ago. Wolves are howling on the wood's borders. If
you have indeed come from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go on.
'The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us-we do not fear them! There is another
_talan_ in the next tree. There the others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for
them. Call us, if anything is amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!'
Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir's message; and soon afterwards Merry and
Pippin clambered up on to the high flet. They were out of breath and seemed rather scared.
`There!' said Merry panting. `We have lugged up your blankets as well as our own. Strider has
hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leaves.'
`You had no need of your burdens,' said Haldir. `It is cold in the tree-tops in winter, though the
wind tonight is in the South; but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the nightchill, and we have skins and cloaks to spare.'
The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. Then they wrapped
themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and
tried to go to sleep. But weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do. Hobbits do not like
heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet was not at all to their
liking as a bedroom. It had no walls. not even a rail; only on one side was there a light plaited
screen, which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind.
Pippin went on talking for a while. `I hope, if I do go to sleep in this bed-loft, that I shan't roll
off,' he said.
`Once I do get to sleep,' said Sam, 'i shall go on sleeping, whether I roll off or no. And the less
said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my meaning.'

Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of
quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes. He could
dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking
in whispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches. At last
lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below,
Frodo fell asleep with the song of Legolas running in his mind.
Late in the night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves were gone. The sickle
Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind was still. A little way off he heard a harsh
laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died
slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into the wood.
A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was
a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits.
`What is it? ' said Frodo.
`_Yrch!_' said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the rope-ladder rolled up.
'Orcs! ' said Frodo. `What are they doing? ' But the Elf had gone.
There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very falls seemed to be hushed.
Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps. He was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground;
but he felt that the trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs were as keen as hounds
on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out Sting: it flashed and glittered like a
blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling
of immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and crawled to the
opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the
tree's foot far below.
Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements. Then he heard
faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk.
He stared down into the dark, holding his breath.
Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed
teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed
upward unwinking. Suddenly they turned away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of
the tree and vanished.
Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches. `There was
something in this tree that I have never seen before,' he said. `It was not an orc. It fled as soon as I
touched the tree-stem. It seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought
that it was one of you hobbits.
'I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk battle. A strong company of
Orcs has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel-curse their foul feet in its clean water!-and went on
down the old road beside the river. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the
ground for a while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a hundred,
so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood.
`Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people. None of the Orcs will
ever return out of Lórien. And there will be many Elves hidden on the northern border before
another night falls. But you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light.'
Day came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the
mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summer's morning was shining.
Pale-blue sky peeped among the moving branches. Looking through an opening on the south side
of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in
the breeze.
The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again, guided now by Haldir
and his brother Rúmil. `Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! ' cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a

gleam of white foam among the grey tree-stems. `Farewell,' he said. It seemed to him that he would
never hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless
changeful music.
They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the Silverlode, and for some
way they followed it southward. There were the prints of orc-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir
turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows.
`There is one of my people yonder across the stream,' he said `though you may not see him.' He
gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in
grey, but with his hood thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully
cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the
bank.
`Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,' said Haldir 'and it runs both swift and
deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it so far north, unless we must. But in these days of
watchfulness we do not make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!' He made his end of the
rope fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and back again, as if he
were on a road.
`I can walk this path,' said Legolas; `but the others have not this skill. Must they swim?'
`No!' said Haldir. `We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above the other, one shoulderhigh, and another half-high, and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care.'
When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some cautiously and
slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for he was sure-footed, and he
walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did
not look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water
as if it was a chasm in the mountains.
He breathed with relief when he was safely across. `Live and learn! as my gaffer used to say.
Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider.
Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that! '
When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode, the Elves
untied the ropes and coiled two of them. Rúmil, who had remained on the other side, drew back the
last one, slung it on his shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep
watch.
`Now, friends,' said Haldir, `you have entered the Naith of Lórien or the Gore, as you would say,
for it is the land that lies like a spear-head between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great.
We allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set foot
there.
`As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The other may walk free for
a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.'
This was not at all to the liking of Gimli. `The agreement was made without my consent,' he
said. `I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never
had dealings with any of the servants of the Enemy. Neither have we done harm to the Elves. I am
no more likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.'
'I do not doubt you,' said Haldir. 'Yet this is our law. I am not the master of the law, and cannot
set it aside. I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant.'
Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his hand upon the haft of his axe.
'I will go forward free,' he said, 'or I will go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be
true of word, though I perish alone in the wilderness.'
`You cannot go back,' said Haldir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far, you must be brought
before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will.
You cannot cross the rivers again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot
pass. You would be slain before you saw them.'

Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their bows. 'A plague on
Dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said Legolas.
'Come!' said Aragorn. `If I am still to lead this Company, you must do as I bid. It is hard upon
the Dwarf to be thus singled out. We will all be blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it
will make the journey slow and dull.'
Gimli laughed suddenly. `A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will Haldir lead us all on a
string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I will be content, if only Legolas here shares my
blindness.'
`I am an Elf and a kinsman here,' said Legolas, becoming angry in his turn.
`Now let us cry: "a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!"' said Aragorn. `But the Company shall
all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! '
`I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do not lead us well,' said Gimli
as they bound a cloth about his eyes.
'You will have no claim,' said Haldir. `I shall lead you well, and the paths are smooth and
straight.'
`Alas for the folly of these days! ' said Legolas. 'Here all are enemies of the one Enemy, and yet
I must walk blind, while the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold! '
`Folly it may seem,' said Haldir. 'Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly
shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and
trust do we find now in the world beyond Lothlórien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not
by our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many perils, and our hands
are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp.
`The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the Shadow has crept
northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for that it already seems too late. The
mountains to the west are growing evil; to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron's
creatures; and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the
mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come to the shores of the
Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. It is said that there are still havens of. the High
Elves, but they are far north and west, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be,
though the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.'
`You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,' said Merry. `There are Elf-havens west of
my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.'
`Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea! ' said Haldir. 'It is long indeed since
any of my folk have looked on it, yet still we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we
walk.'
`I cannot,' said Merry. `I have never seen them. I have never been out of my own land before.
And if I had known what the world outside was like. I don't think I should have had the heart to
leave it.'
`Not even to see fair Lothlórien? ' said Haldir. 'The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there
are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled
with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.
`Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and peace shall come again.
Yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the
Sun as it was aforetime. For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass to
the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for Lothlórien that I love! It would be
a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea,
none have reported it.'
As they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the wood, led by Haldir, while
the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a
while they walked more freely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found his

hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the trodden grass. He could hear
many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right,
and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when they
passed through an open glade.
As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, and
it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of
time into a corner of the Elder Days, and was -now walking in a world that was no more. In
Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lórien the ancient things still lived on in the
waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there, sorrow had been known; the Elves feared and
distrusted the world outside: wolves were howling on the wood's borders: but on the land of Lórien
no shadow lay.
All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early
night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then they rested and slept without fear upon the
ground; for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. In
the morning they went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo was aware
that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all
around him.
A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening toward the northern borders
to guard against any attack from Moria; and they brought news, some of which Haldir reported.
The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward
towards the mountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, running
with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet not of beast-shape. It had
eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished
down the Silverlode southward.
`Also,' said Haldir, `they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim. You are
all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that the Lady knows who and what is each member
of your Company. New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps.'
He removed the bandage first from Gimli's eyes. 'Your pardon! ' he said, bowing low. `Look on
us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the
Naith of Lórien since Durin's Day! '
When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his breath. They were
standing in an open space. To the left stood a great mound, covered with a sward of grass as green
as Spring-time in the Elder Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer
had bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness; the inner were
mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in pale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree
that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all about the
green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them,
nodding on slender stalks, were other flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist
amid the rich hue of the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the
hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees.
'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,' said Haldir. `For this is the heart of the ancient realm
as it was long ago, and here is the mound of Amroth, where in happier days his high house was
built. Here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow _elanor_, and the pale
_niphredil_. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim at dusk.'
The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo stood awhile still lost in
wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished
world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but
the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering
of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold

and white and blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first
perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here no heart could mourn
for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew
upon the earth. On the land of Lórien there was no stain.
He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled
expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake. `It's sunlight and bright
day, right enough,' he said. `I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish
than anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was _inside_ a song. if you take my meaning.'
Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word. He
smiled. `You feel the power of the Lady of the Galadhrim,' he said. `Would it please you to climb
with me up Cerin Amroth? '
They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. Though he walked and
breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his
face, Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness.
When he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire
would walk there, upon the grass among _elanor_ and _niphredil_ in fair Lothlórien.
They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth
and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had
long ago been washed away, and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth.
Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo prepared to follow him, he
laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly
aware of the feel and texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in wood and
the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the delight of the living tree itself.
As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand and turned him toward
the South. `Look this way first! ' he said.
Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty trees, or a city of green
towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, it seemed to him that the power and light came that
held all the land in sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then he
looked eastward and saw all the land of Lórien running down to the pale gleam of Anduin, the
Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out, and he was back again in
the world he knew. Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far
away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on Lothlórien had no power to
enlighten the shadow of that distant height.
`There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,' said Haldir. `It is clad in a forest of dark fir,
where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a
stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now
it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it of late. In this high
place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another; and ever they strive now in
thought, but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been
discovered. Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him.
At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a
small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory:
and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place.
For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a
young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not
see_. Arwen vanimelda, namárië!_ he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his
thought he looked at Frodo and smiled.
`Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,' he said, `and here my heart dwells ever, unless there be
a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread, you and I. Come with me! ' And taking
Frodo's hand in his, he left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man.

_Chapter 7_
The Mirror of Galadriel
The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were deepening in the woods, when
they went on again. Their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night
came beneath the trees as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps.
Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky
pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless space before them, running in a great circle
and bending away on either hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass
upon its brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. Upon the further
side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees
taller than any they had yet seen in all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood
up in the twilight like living towers. In their, many-tiered branches and amid their ever-moving
leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and silver. Haldir turned towards the
Company.
`Welcome to Caras Galadhon! ' he said. 'Here is the city of the Galadhrim where dwell the Lord
Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lórien. But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look
northward. We must go round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is great.'
There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the fosse. Along this they
went westward, with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night
deepened more lights sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last to a
white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they faced south-west, set between the
ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many
lamps.
Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of guards Frodo could see no
sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates shut behind them. They were in a deep lane
between the ends of the wall, and passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No
folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices, about them, and
in the air above. Far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high
like soft rain upon leaves.
They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to the high places and
saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. It was lit by silver lamps that swung
from the boughs of trees, and it fell into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon
the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great smooth bole gleamed
like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under
shadowy clouds of leaves. Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were
seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in
grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.
'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,' said Haldir. `It is their wish that you should ascend and
speak with them.'
One of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it was answered three times
from far above. `I will go first,' said Haldir. 'Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others
may follow as they wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs, but you
may rest upon the way.'
As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some on another, and
some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them. At a great height above

the ground he came to a wide _talan_, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large
that almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered behind Haldir, and
found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great
mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth.
The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and silver and its roof of gold.
Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living
bough there sat, side by side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after the
manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall they were, and the Lady
no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and
the hair of the Lady was of deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and
bright; but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their eyes; for these were
keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the wells of deep memory.
Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own tongue. The Lady
Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face.
`Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire! ' said Celeborn. `When all have come we will
speak together.'
Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. `Welcome Aragorn son
of Arathorn! ' he said. `It is eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land;
and those years lie heavy on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for
a while! '
'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the North.'
`Welcome Gimli son of Glóin! It is long indeed since we saw one of Durin's folk in Caras
Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May it be a sign that though the world is now
dark better days are at hand, and that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' Gimli
bowed low.
When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at them again. 'Here there are
eight,' he said. `Nine were to set out: so said the messages. But maybe there has been some change
of counsel that we have not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this
year the shadows have grown longer.'
`Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking for the first time. Her
voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's wont. `Gandalf the Grey set out with the
Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired
to speak with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the fences of
Lothlórien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me.'
'Alas! ' said Aragorn. `Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained in Moria and did not
escape.'
At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement. `These are evil
tidings,' said Celeborn, `the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous
deeds.' He turned to Haldir. `Why has nothing of this been told to me before? ' he asked in the
Elven-tongue.
'We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose,' said Legolas. `At first we were
weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we
walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lórien.'
`Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,' said Frodo. 'Gandalf was our guide, and
he led us through Moria; and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.'
'Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn:
Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of Caradhras, and in the days that
followed; and he spoke of Balin and his book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the
fire, and the narrow bridge, and the coming of the Terror. 'An evil of the Ancient World it seemed,

such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. `It was both a shadow and a flame, strong and
terrible.'
'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; `of all elf-banes the most deadly, save the One who
sits in the Dark Tower.'
`Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams l saw Durin's Bane,' said
Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.
'Alas! ' said Celeborn. `We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept. But had I
known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in Moria again, l would have forbidden you to pass
the northern borders, you and all that went with you. And if it were possible, one would say that at
the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria.'
`He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely. `Needless were none of
the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full
purpose. But however it may be with the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your
welcome to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlórien, who of the
Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient
home, though it had become an abode of dragons?
'Dark is the water of Kheled-zâram, and cold are the springs of Kibil-nâla, and fair were the
many-pillared halls of Khazad-dûm in Elder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the
stone.' She looked upon Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing
the names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it seemed to him that
he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding. Wonder came
into his face, and then he smiled in answer.
He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: `Yet more fair is the living land of
Lórien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth! '
There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. `I did not know that your plight was so
evil,' he said. `Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I
can to aid you, each according to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk who
bears the burden.'
'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. `But we will not here speak of it
more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as
Gandalf himself plainly purposed. For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the
Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the West
since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond
or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought
the long defeat.
'I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had not gone amiss, it
would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone
otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that.
For not in doing or contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail; but
only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But this I will say to you: your
Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope
remains while all the Company is true.'
And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked searchingly at each of
them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed
and hung his head.
At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she smiled. `Do not let your
hearts be troubled,' she said. 'Tonight you shall sleep in peace.' Then they sighed and felt suddenly
weary, as those who have been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken
openly.

`Go now! ' said Celeborn. `You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even if your Quest did not
concern us closely, you should have refuge in this City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now
you shall rest, and we will not speak of your further road for a while.'
That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction of the hobbits. The
Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches;
then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers
talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day's journey, and of the Lord and Lady;
for they had not yet the heart to look further back.
`What did you blush for, Sam? ' said Pippin. `You soon broke down. Anyone would have
thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of
my blankets.'
`I never thought no such thing,' answered Sam, in no mood for jest. 'If you want to know, I felt
as if I hadn't got nothing on, and I didn't like it. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what I would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole
with-with a bit of garden of my own.'
`That's funny,' said Merry. 'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, only well, I don't think I'II
say any more,' he ended lamely.
All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was offered a choice between a
shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it
lay, and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against
Sauron to others.
`And it seemed to me, too,' said Gimli, `that my choice would remain secret and known only to
myself.'
'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,' said Boromir. `Maybe it was only a test, and she thought
to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but almost I should have said that she was tempting
us, and offering what she pretended to have the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to
listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.' But what he thought that the Lady had
offered him Boromir did not tell.
And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with questions. `She held
you long in her gaze, Ring-bearer,' he said.
`Yes,' said Frodo; `but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there.'
`Well, have a care! ' said Boromir. `I do not feel too sure of this Elvish Lady and her purposes.'
`Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! ' said Aragorn sternly. 'You know not what you say. There
is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man bring it hither himself. Then let him beware! But
tonight I shall sleep without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep deep, and
forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.' He cast himself down upon his couch
and fell at once into a long sleep.
The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber. When they woke
they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion. and the fountain rose
and fell glittering in the sun.
They remained some days in Lothlórien, so far as they could tell or remember. All the while that
they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away
leaving all things fresh and clean. The air was cool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they felt
about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them that they did little but eat and
drink and rest, and walk among the trees; and it was enough.
They had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had little speech with the Elven-folk; for
few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue. Haldir had bidden them farewell and gone
back again to the fences of the North, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria
that the Company had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and after the first
night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he returned to eat and talk with them.

Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this
change.
Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had
known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As they were healed of hurt and weariness
of body the grief of their loss grew more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and
knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among the
sweet sad words that they could not understand.
_Mithrandir, Mithrandir_ sang the Elves, _O Pilgrim Grey!_For so they loved to call him. But if
Legolas was with the Company, he would not interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not
the skill, and that for him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song.
It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. He was seldom moved to
make song or rhyme; even in Rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself, though his
memory was stored with many things that others had made before him. But now as he sat beside
the fountain in Lórien and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a song
that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only snatches remained, faded as a
handful of withered leaves.
When evening in the Shire was grey
his footsteps on the Hill were heard;
before the dawn he went away
on journey long without a word.
From Wilderland to Western shore,
from northern waste to southern hill,
through dragon-lair and hidden door
and darkling woods he walked at will.
With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men,
with mortal and immortal folk,
with bird on bough and beast in den,
in their own secret tongues he spoke.
A deadly sword, a healing hand,
a back that bent beneath its load;
a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,
a weary pilgrim on the road.
A lord of wisdom throned he sat,
swift in anger, quick to laugh;
an old man in a battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff.
He stood upon the bridge alone
and Fire and Shadow both defied;
his staff was broken on the stone,
in Khazad-dûm his wisdom died.
`Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! ' said Sam.
'No, I am afraid not,' said Frodo. 'But that is the best I can do yet.'

'Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you'll say a word about his fireworks,' said
Sam. `Something like this:
The finest rockets ever seen:
they burst in stars of blue and green,
or after thunder golden showers
came falling like a rain of flowers.
Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.'
`No, I'll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I can't talk of it any more. I can't
bear to think of bringing the news to him.'
One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight. Both of them felt
restless again. On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen: he knew somehow that the time
was very near when he must leave Lothlórien.
`What do you think of Elves now, Sam? ' he said. `I asked you the same question once before-it
seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more of them since then.'
'I have indeed! ' said Sam. 'And I reckon there's Elves and Elves. They're all elvish enough, but
they're not all the same. Now these folk aren't wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the
likes of us: they seem to belong here, more even than Hobbits do in the Shire. Whether they've
made the land, or the land's made them, it's hard to say, if you take my meaning. It's wonderfully
quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and nobody seems to want it to. If there's any magic
about, it's right down deep, where I can't lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.'
'You can see and feel it everywhere,' said Frodo.
'Well,' said Sam, 'you can't see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor Gandalf used to show.
I wonder we don't see nothing of the Lord and Lady in all these days. I fancy now that _she_ could
do some wonderful things, if she had a mind. I'd dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo! '
'I wouldn't,' said Frodo. `I am content. And I don't miss Gandalf's fireworks, but his bushy
eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.'
`You're right,' said Sam. `And don't think I'm finding fault. I've often wanted to see a bit of
magic like what it tells of in old tales, but I've never heard of a better land than this. It's like being
at home and on a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don't want to leave. All the
same, I'm beginning to feel that if we've got to go on, then we'd best get it over.
'_It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish_, as my old gaffer used to say. And I
don't reckon that these folk can do much more to help us, magic or no. It's when we leave this land
that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.'
'I am afraid that's only too true, Sam,' said Frodo. `Yet I hope very much that before we leave we
shall see the Lady of the Elves again.'
Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, the Lady Galadriel
approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees. She spoke no word, but
beckoned to them.
Turning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of Caras Galadhon, and
passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it
lay open to the sky. The evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western
woods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into a deep green hollow, through which ran
murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill. At the bottom, upon a low
pedestal carved like a branching tree, stood a basin of silver. wide and shallow, and beside it stood
a silver ewer.
With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and breathed on it, and when
the water was still again she spoke. `Here is the Mirror of Galadriel,' she said. 'I have brought you
here so that you may look in it, if you will.'

The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside him was tall and pale.
'What shall we look for, and what shall we see? ' asked Frodo, filled with awe.
`Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,' she answered, `and to some I can show what
they desire to see. But the Mirror will also show things unbidden, and those are often stranger and
more profitable than things which we wish to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror
free to work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that are, things that yet may be.
But which it is that he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish to look? '
Frodo did not answer.
`And you? ' she said, turning to Sam. 'For this is what your folk would call magic. I believe;
though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the
deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you
wished to see Elf-magic? '
'I did,' said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. `I'll have a peep, Lady, if you're
willing.'
`And I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an aside to Frodo. 'It seems a
terrible long time that I've been away. But there, like as not I'll only see the stars, or something that
I won't understand.'
'Like as not,' said the Lady with a gentle laugh. `But come, you shall look and see what you
may. Do not touch the water! '
Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. The water looked hard
and dark. Stars were reflected in it.
`There's only stars, as I thought,' he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for the stars went out. As if a
dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the
branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind
what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying
fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and
climbing an endless winding stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for
something, but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went back, and he
saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and he could see what was going on: they
were not waving in the wind, they were falling, crashing to the ground.
`Hi!' cried Sam in an outraged voice. 'There's that Ted Sandyman a-cutting down trees as he
shouldn't. They didn't ought to be felled: it's that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to
Bywater. I wish I could get at Ted, and I'd fell _him_!'
But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large red-brick building was being
put up where it had stood. Lots of folk were busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby.
Black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the Mirror.
'There's some devilry at work in the Shire,' he said. 'Elrond knew what he was about when he
wanted to send Mr. Merry back.' Then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away. 'I can't stay here,'
he said wildly. `I must go home. They've dug up Bagshot Row, and there's the poor old gaffer
going down the Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! '
'You cannot go home alone,' said the Lady. 'You did not wish to go home without your master
before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the
Shire. Remember that the Mirror shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some
never come to be, unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them.
The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.'
Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. `I wish I had never come here, and I don't
want to see no more magic,' he said and fell silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if
struggling with tears. `No, I'll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,' he said. `But
I hope I do get back some day. If what I've seen turns out true, somebody's going to catch it hot! '

`Do you now wish to look, Frodo? ' said the Lady Galadriel. `You did not wish to see Elf-magic
and were content.'
`Do you advise me to look? ' asked Frodo.
'No,' she said. `I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am not a counsellor. You may learn
something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not.
Seeing is both good and perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for
the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will! '
`I will look,' said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water. At once
the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land. Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale
sky. A long grey road wound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint
and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. Suddenly Frodo realized that it
reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that the
figure was clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its hand
there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no face, and presently the figure
turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the Mirror's view. Doubt came into Frodo's
mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it
Saruman?
The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking
restlessly about his room. The table was littered with disordered papers; rain was beating on the
windows.
Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to
be parts of a great history in which he had become involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight
which he had never seen before but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in
a great storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of clouds, the black
outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West. Then a wide river flowing through a
populous city. Then a white fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but
now it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing the emblem of a
white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle arose, and again the sun went down in a
burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with
lights. It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.
But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of
sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly
grew. until it filled nearly all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry
out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's,
watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.
Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew with certainty and
horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one. But he also knew that it could
not see him-not yet, not unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew
heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed to be
growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water. He was slipping forward.
`Do not touch the water!' said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, and Frodo found that
he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and
looked at the Lady.
`I know what it was that you last saw,' she said; `for that is also in my mind. Do not be afraid!
But do not think that only by singing amid the trees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows,
is this land of Lothlórien maintained and defended against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo, that even
as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or all of his mind that concerns the
Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my thought. But still the door is closed! '
She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East in a gesture of rejection
and denial. Eärendil, the Evening Star, most beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was

it that the figure of the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring
about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light, and a white stone in it
twinkled as if the Even-star had come down to rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with
awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.
`Yes,' she said, divining his thought, `it is not permitted to speak of it, and Elrond could not do
so. But it cannot be hidden from the Ring-bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the
land of Lórien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains. This is Nenya, the Ring
of Adamant, and I am its keeper.
`He suspects, but he does not know – not yet. Do you not see now wherefore your coming is to
us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail, then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed,
then our power is diminished, and Lothlórien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it away.
We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly to forget and to
be forgotten.'
Frodo bent his head. `And what do you wish? ' he said at last.
`That what should be shall be,' she answered. `The love of the Elves for their land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be
assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now. For the
fate of Lothlórien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own task. Yet I could wish,
were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.'
'You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,' said Frodo. `I will give you the One Ring, if
you ask for it. It is too great a matter for me.'
Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. `Wise the Lady Galadriel may be,' she said, `yet
here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our
first meeting. You begin to see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to
ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should the Great Ring
come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my grasp. The evil that was devised long
ago works on in many ways, whether Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a
noble deed to set to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?
`And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place of the Dark Lord you will
set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night!
Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the
Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair! '
She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated
her alone and left all else dark. She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and
beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded,
and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple
white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.
'I pass the test,' she said. `I will diminish, and go into the West and remain Galadriel.'
They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. `Let us return! ' she said.
`In the morning you must depart for now we have chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.'
`I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, `a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in
Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the
thoughts of those that wear them? '
`You have not tried,' she said. `Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you
knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings
give power according to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you
would need to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet even so,
as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight is
grown keener. You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise.

You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize the
ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring? ' she asked turning again to Sam.
'No, Lady,' he answered. `To tell you the truth, I wondered what you were talking about. I saw a
star through your finger. But if you'll pardon my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish
you'd take his Ring. You'd put things to rights. You'd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning
him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.'
`I would,' she said. `That is how it would begin. But it would not stop with that, alas! We will
not speak more of it. Let us go!'
_Chapter 8_
Farewell to Lórien
That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn, and there the Lord
and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn spoke of their departure.
`Now is the time,' he said, `when those who wish to continue the Quest must harden their hearts
to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here, for a while. But
whether they stay or go, none can be sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom.
Here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open
again. or we summon them to the last need of Lórien. Then they may return to their own lands, or
else go to the long home of those that fall in battle.'
There was a silence. `They all resolved to go forward,' said Galadriel looking in their eyes.
`As for me,' said Boromir, `my way home lies onward and not back.'
`That is true,' said Celeborn, `but is all this Company going with you to Minas Tirith? '
`We have not decided our course,' said Aragorn. 'Beyond Lothlórien I do not know what
Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had any clear purpose.'
`Maybe not,' said Celeborn, `yet when you leave this land, you can no longer forget the Great
River. As some of you know well, it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lórien
and Gondor, save by boat. And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings
held now by the Enemy?
`On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this side, upon the west; but
the straight road of the Quest lies east of the River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you
now take? '
`If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to Minas Tirith,' answered
Boromir. `But I am not the leader of the Company.' The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked
doubtful and troubled.
`I see that you do not yet know what to do,' said Celeborn. `It is not my part to choose for you;
but I will help you as I may. There are some among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk
know the swift Forest River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.'
`And one Hobbit! ' cried Merry. `Not all of us look on boats as wild horses. My people live by
the banks of the Brandywine.'
`That is well,' said Celeborn. `Then I will furnish your Company with boats. They must be small
and light, for if you go far by water, there are places where you will be forced to carry them. You
will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the River
thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may make your journey less
toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave them and the
River, and turn west-or east.'
Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him much, not least because
there would now be no need to decide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more
hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet

them than to plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still thought
boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think
better of them.
`All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow,' said Celeborn.
'I will send my people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey. Now we will
wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep.'
'Good night, my friends! ' said Galadriel. 'Sleep in peace! Do not trouble your hearts overmuch
with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before
your feet, though you do not see them. Good night! '
The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. Legolas went with them, for
this was to be their last night in Lothlórien, and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to
take counsel together.
For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be best to attempt the
fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came to no decision. It was plain that most of
them desired to go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the
Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of
Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind.
His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his
sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons, and
that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for
the mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could
not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir. And yet what help could
he or any of the Company give to Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?
`I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said Boromir; and after that he
was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling's
thoughts. At length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. `If you wish only to
destroy the Ring,' he said, `then there is little use in war and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith
cannot help. But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go
without force into his domain; and folly to throw away.' He paused suddenly, as if he had become
aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. `It would be folly to throw lives away, I mean,' he
ended. `It is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death.
At least, that is how I see it.'
Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir's glance, and he looked hard at him.
Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final words. It would be folly to throw away:
what? The Ring of Power? He had said something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted
the correction of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and
made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate ended. Merry and Pippin
were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The night was growing old.
In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their
tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey. The food
was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the
outside, and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a
doubtful eye.
`_Cram_,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it. His
expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.
`No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing. `You have eaten enough already for a long day's
march.'
`I thought it was only a kind of _cram_, such as the Dale-men make for journeys in the wild,'
said the Dwarf.

`So it is,' they answered. `But we call it _lembas_ or waybread, and it is more strengthening than
any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant than _cram_, by all accounts.'
`Indeed it is,' said Gimli. 'Why it is better than the honey-cakes of the Beornings, and that is
great praise, for the Beornings are the best bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to
deal out their cakes to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! '
'All the same, we bid you spare the food,' they said. 'Eat little at a time, and only at need. For
these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many
days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep
a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith.'
The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought. For
each they had provided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken
stuff that the Galadhrim wove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of
twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they
were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the
stars. Each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.
`Are these magic cloaks? ' asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.
`I do not know what you mean by that,' answered the leader of the Elves. `They are fair
garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that
is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these
things under the twilight of Lórien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all
that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade. But they
should serve you well: they are light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you
will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among
the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady! For she herself and her
maidens wove this stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.'
After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain. Their hearts
were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had become like home to them, though they could not
count the days and nights that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the
white water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade.
Frodo greeted him with delight.
'I have returned from the Northern Fences,' said the Elf, `and I am sent now to be your guide
again. The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled.
There are noises in the deeps of the earth. If any of you had thought of returning northwards to your
homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your path now goes south.'
As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in the trees above
them many voices were murmuring and singing. They themselves went silently. At last Haldir led
them down the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps,
and to the white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then they turned away
from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed
on, winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and
eastwards, towards the shores of the River.
They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall.
Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees. Before them lay a long lawn of
shining grass, studded with golden _elanor_ that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow
tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering; on the left
and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands
still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and bare. No
mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lórien.
On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of the streams, there was a
hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were moored many boats and barges. Some were

brightly painted, and shone with silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey.
Three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves stowed their
goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat. Slender they looked, but strong, silken
to the touch, grey of hue like the elven-cloaks.
`What are these? ' asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the greensward.
`Ropes indeed! ' answered an Elf from the boats. 'Never travel far without a rope! And one that
is long and strong and light. Such are these. They may be a help in many needs.'
'You don't need to tell me that! ' said Sam. `I came without any and I've been worried ever since.
But I was wondering what these were made of, knowing a bit about rope-making: it's in the family
as you might say.'
`They are made of _hithlain_,' said the Elf, `but there is no time now to instruct you in the art of
their making. Had we known that this craft delighted you, we could have taught you much. But
now alas! unless you should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it
serve you well! '
`Come! ' said Haldir. `All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But take care at first! '
'Heed the words! ' said the other Elves. 'These boats are light-built, and they are crafty and
unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, lade them as you will; but they are wayward if
mishandled. It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there
is a landing-place, before you set off downstream.'
The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir,
Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast
friends. In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and
steered with short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready Aragorn
led them on a trial up the Silverlode. The current was swift and they went forward slowly. Sam sat
in the bows, clutching the sides, and looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on
the water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the trees drew
down to the river's brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream.
The air was very bright and still, and there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.
They turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down the stream toward them,
they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its
curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones;
its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew nearer; and suddenly
they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two
elves clad in white steered it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind
him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her hand she
held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air:
I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:
Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.
Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,
And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.
Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,
In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.
There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,
While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.
O Lórien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;
The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.
O Lórien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore
And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.
But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,

What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?
Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended her song and greeted
them. `We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she said, `and to speed you with blessings from
our land.'
`Though you have been our guests,' said Celeborn, `you have not yet eaten with us, and we bid
you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between the flowing waters that will bear you far from
Lórien.'
The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and followed it. There in
the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank
little, heeding only the beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible,
nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later days Elves still at
times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind
by the flowing streams of Time.
After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke to them again of their
journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the Tongue.
`As you go down the water,' he said, `you will find that the trees will fail, and you will come to a
barren country. There the River flows in stony vale amid high moors, until at last after many
leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms
about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of
Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of
sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by
many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this side of the Great
River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from
the East there, for they look out over the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and
the black gates of Mordor.
'Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well to leave the Great River
above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds the marshes. Yet they should not go too far up
that stream, nor risk becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is
now little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning.'
'Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,' said Boromir. `But what I have heard seems
to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan
is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of
our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to prove or disprove the
legends that have come down from distant years.
`I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it northwards. When I was sent
out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the
Isen and the Greyflood into Northerland. A long and wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I
reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at the fording of the
Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt
that I shall find a way through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.'
`Then I need say no more,' said Celeborn. 'But do not despise the lore that has come down from
distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were
needful for the wise to know.'
Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to Celeborn.
'Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,' she said. `Drink, Lord of the Galadhrim! And let not
your heart be sad though night must follow noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.'
Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink and farewell. But when
they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass, and chairs were set for her and for

Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. At last she
spoke again.
'We have drunk the cup of parting,' she said, `and the shadows fall between us. But before you
go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in
memory of Lothlórien.' Then she called to each in turn.
`Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your Company,' she said to Aragorn,
and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of
flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many
gems the name Andúril and the lineage of the sword.
`The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat,' she said.
`But is there aught else that you desire of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and
it may be that we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning.'
And Aragorn answered: 'Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in keeping the only
treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness
shall I come to it.'
`Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,' said Galadriel; `for it was left in my care to be given to
you, should you pass through this land.' Then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green,
set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; and as she
held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring. `This stone I gave to
Celebrían my daughter, and she to hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour
take the name that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil! '
Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and those who saw him
wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that
many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders. `For the gifts that you have given me I thank you,'
he said, 'O Lady of Lórien of whom were sprung Celebrían and Arwen Evenstar. What praise could
I say more? '
The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she gave a belt of gold;
and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower.
To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of
Mirkwood, and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows.
`For you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to Sam, `I have only a small gift.' She put
into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid.
`Here is set G for Galadriel,' she said; `but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In this box
there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has still to bestow is upon it. It will
not keep you on your road, nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home
again at last, then perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid waste,
there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you sprinkle this
earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, and catch a glimpse far off of Lórien, that you have
seen only in our winter. For our spring and our summer are gone by, and they will never be seen on
earth again save in memory.'
Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he clutched the box and bowed
as well as he could.
`And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves? ' said Galadriel turning to Gimli.
`None, Lady,' answered Gimli. `It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of the Galadhrim, and
to have heard her gentle words.'
`Hear all ye Elves! ' she cried to those about her. `Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping
and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Glóin, you desire something that I could give? Name it, I
bid you! You shall not be the only guest without a gift.'
`There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,' said Gimli, bowing low and stammering. `Nothing, unless it
might be – unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses

the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you
commanded me to name my desire.'
The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder,
but the Lady smiled. 'It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their
tongues ' she said; `yet that is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold
and yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak? But tell me, what
would you do with such a gift? '
`Treasure it, Lady,' he answered, `in memory of your words to me at our first meeting. And if
ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of
my house, and a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.'
Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three golden hairs, and laid them in
Gimli's hand. `These words shall go with the gift,' she said. `I do not foretell, for all foretelling is
now vain: on the one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not fail,
then I say to you, Gimli son of Glóin, that your hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold
shall have no dominion.
`And you, Ring-bearer,' she said, turning to Frodo. `I come to you last who are not last in my
thoughts. For you I have prepared this.' She held up a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved
it, and rays of white light sprang from her hand. 'In this phial,' she said, `is caught the light of
Eärendil's star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night is about
you. May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and
her Mirror! '
Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw her again standing like
a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say.
Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow noon lay on the green
land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with silver. All at last was made ready. The Company
took their places in the boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lórien with long grey poles
thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them slowly away. The
travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the green bank near to the very point of the
Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes
watched her slowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: Lórien was slipping
backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to forgotten shores, while they
sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world.
Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the Great River, and their
boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the white form of the Lady was small and
distant. She shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake
seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo that she lifted
her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on the following wind came the sound of her
voice singing. But now she sang in the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not
understand the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him.
Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, and long afterwards he
interpreted them, as well as he could: the language was that of Elven-song and spoke of things little
known on Middle-earth.
Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrinen,
Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron!
Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier
mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva
Andúnë pella, Vardo tellumar

Sí man i yulma nin enquantuva?
An sí Tintallë Varda Oiolossëo

Si vanwa ná, Rómello vanwa, Valimar!
Namárië! Nai hiruvalyë Valimar.
Nai elyë hiruva. Namárië!
`Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of trees! The long
years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the
blue vaults of Varda wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who now
shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of the Stars, from Mount
Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of
a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of
Calacirya for ever. Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou shalt
find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell! ' Varda is the name of that Lady whom the
Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth.
Suddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either side, and the light of
Lórien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came again.
The travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was before them, and their eyes
were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. Gimli wept openly.
`I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,' he said to Legolas his companion.
`Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless it be her gift.' He put his hand to his breast.
`Tell me, Legolas, why did I come on this Quest? Little did I know where the chief peril lay!
Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment
in the dark was the danger that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come,
had I known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting, even if
I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for Gimli son of Glóin! '
`Nay! ' said Legolas. `Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world in these after-days. For
such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But
I count you blessed, Gimli son of Glóin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you
might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, and the least reward
that you shall have is that the memory of Lothlórien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your
heart, and shall neither fade nor grow stale.'
`Maybe,' said Gimli; `and I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such
comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheledzâram. Or so says the heart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have
heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. Not so for Dwarves.
'But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the water with all this baggage,
and the Great River is swift. I do not wish to drown my grief in cold water.' He took up a paddle,
and steered towards the western bank, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved
out of the middle stream.
So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, borne ever
southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could not see any glimpse of the lands
behind. The breeze died away and the River flowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the

silence. The sun grew misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white
pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey and starless night. Far
into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the
western woods. Great trees passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the
mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the River fretting among the tree-roots and driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and
he fell into an uneasy sleep.
_Chapter 9_
The Great River
Frodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, under tall grey-skinned
trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept
the night away, and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a
small fire near at hand.
They started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry
southwards: they were content that the decision, which they must make at latest when they came to
Rauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its
own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, whichever course they
took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished, husbanding their strength
against weariness to come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey
on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, and he feared that the Dark
Lord had not been idle while they lingered in Lórien.
Nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day, nor the next. The dull grey hours passed
without event. As the third day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned
and then failed altogether. On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching
up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had passed over them,
leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to
relieve the emptiness. They had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between
Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed of the
Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.
Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was flat, and in many places green
with wide plains of grass. On this side of the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that
they shut out all view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders.
Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and
there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them
hills in the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the southernmost
ranks of the Misty Mountains.
There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there were many: small fowl
whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were seldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the
rush and whine of swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky.
`Swans! ' said Sam. `And mighty big ones too! '
`Yes,' said Aragorn, 'and they are black swans.'
`How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! ' said Frodo. `I always imagined that
as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier, until winter was left behind for ever.'
'But we have not journeyed far south yet,' answered Aragorn. `It is still winter, and we are far
from the sea. Here the world is cold until the sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far
away down in the Bay of Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would
be but for the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of the Southfarthing

away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across the
north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the
mouth of the Limlight that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north
boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White Mountains belonged to
the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do
not dwell by the River or ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds
and studs of Rohan.'
Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile before, as if they
harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished that the trees were still there. He felt that
the Company was too naked, afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a
river that was the frontier of war.
In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, this feeling of insecurity
grew on all the Company. For a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward. The
banks slid by. Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the
east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was needed. The Brown
Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air from the East. On the other side the
meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo
shivered, thinking of the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlórien. There
was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the Company was busy with
his own thoughts.
The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade
amid the beech-woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be
wrought into the housing of the Lady's gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease,
for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt
consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then
Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward
gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as
dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he
had imagined. He was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands
crawling by and the grey water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did
not trust Sam with one.
As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and
Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under
his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and
rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more.
That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam lay rolled in blankets
beside Frodo. `I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,' he said. `Or
maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny it was anyway.'
`Well, what was it? ' said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his
tale, whatever it was. 'I haven't seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left
Lothlórien.'
`It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it wasn't a dream. And you had
best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with eyes! '
`The log's all right,' said Frodo. `There are many in the River. But leave out the eyes! '
`That I won't,' said Sam. ` 'Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to speak. I saw what I took to be
a log floating along in the half-light behind Gimli's boat; but I didn't give much heed to it. Then it
seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as
we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-

like, on a hump at the near end of the log. What's more, it wasn't a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a
swan's almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water.
'That's when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a shout, if it was still there
when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head. For the whatever-it-was was coming along fast now
and getting close behind Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or
whether I came to my senses, I don't know. When I looked again, it wasn't there. Yet I think I
caught a glimpse with the tail of-my eye, as the saying is, of something dark shooting under the
shadow of the bank. I couldn't see no more eyes though.
`I said to myself: "dreaming again, Sam Gamgee," I said: and I said no more just then. But I've
been thinking since. and now I'm not so sure. What do you make of it, Mr. Frodo? '
'I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes Sam, said Frodo, if
this was the first time that those eyes had been seen. But it isn't. I saw them away back north before
we reached Lórien. And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night. Haldir
saw it too. And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the orc-band? '
`Ah,' said Sam. `I do; and I remember more too. I don't like my thoughts; but thinking of one
thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo's stories and all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a
guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe? '
`Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,' said Frodo. `Ever since the night on the flet. I
suppose he was lurking in Moria, and picked up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lórien
would throw him off the scent again. The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods
by the Silverlode, watching us start off! '
`That's about it,' said Sam. `And we'd better be a bit more watchful ourselves, or we'll feel some
nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that's
what I was leading up to. No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight. I'll keep watch. I can
sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.'
`I might,' said Frodo, `and I might say "luggage with eyes". You shall watch; but only if you
promise to wake me halfway towards morning, if nothing happens before then.'
In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking him. `It's a shame to
wake you,' whispered Sam, `but that's what you said. There's nothing to tell, or not much. I thought
I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such queer
sounds by a river at night.'
He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off his sleep. Minutes or
hours passed slowly, and nothing happened. Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down
again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish
hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone
coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot. They were not
more than a yard or two away, and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up,
drawing Sting from its sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was
another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into the night. Aragorn
stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up`
'What is it? ' he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. `I felt something in my sleep.
Why have you drawn your sword? '
`Gollum,' answered Frodo. 'Or at least, so I guess.'
`Ah! ' said Aragorn. `So you know about our little footpad, do you? He padded after us all
through Moria and right down to Nimrodel. Since we took to boats, he has been lying on a log and
paddling with hands and feet. I have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a
fox, and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he is too clever a
waterman.
`We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, and I will keep watch for what
is left of the night. I wish I could lay my hands on the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I

cannot, we shall have to try and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night
on his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.'
The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. After that the Company
kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted. If he was still
following, he was very wary and cunning. At Aragorn's bidding they paddled now for long spells,
and the banks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they journeyed mostly by
night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden as the land allowed. In this way the time
passed without event until the seventh day.
The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but as evening drew into night
the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint light, yellow and pale green, opened under the
grey shores of cloud. There the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the
remote lakes. Sam looked at it and puckered his brows.
The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The banks began to rise and
grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, and on both shores there were steep
slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them
stood low crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and beyond these
again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near to the grey
hill-country of the Emyn Muil, the southern march of Wilderland.
There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all day high in the air flocks
of birds had been circling, black against the pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn
watched the flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of
their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the sun was setting, and the Company was
stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a dark spot against the fading light: a great bird
high and far off, now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.
'What is that, Legolas? ' he asked, pointing to the northern sky. 'Is it, as I think. an eagle? '
'Yes.' said Legolas. `It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what that forebodes. It is far from
the mountains.'
`We will not start until it is fully dark,' said Aragorn.
The eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the grey east wind had passed
away. The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear
above, and though far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in
the West stars glinted bright.
`Come! ' said Aragorn. `We will venture one more journey by night. We are coming to reaches
of the River that I do not know well: for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before, not
between here and the rapids of Sarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many
miles ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and stony eyots in
the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly.'
To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He lay forward peering into the
gloom. The night grew dark, but the stars above were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer On
the face of the River. It was close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while. hardly
using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There was a swift current which swung left,
towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers
could see, now very close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust
out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. The boats were all huddled together.
`Hoy there, Aragorn! ' shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the leader. `This is madness!
We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day.'
`Back, back! ' cried Aragorn. 'Turn! Turn if you can! ' He drove his paddle into the water, trying
to hold the boat and bring it round.

'I am out of my reckoning,' he said to Frodo. 'I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin
flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already.'
With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about; but at first they could
make only small headway against the current, and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer
to the eastern bank. Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night.
'All together, paddle! ' shouted Boromir. 'Paddle! Or we shall be driven on the shoals.' Even as
he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone.
At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled over them, and some
fell among them. One smote Frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry, letting
go his paddle: but the arrow fell back. foiled by his hidden coat of mail. Another passed through
Aragorn's hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by Merry's hand.
Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle-banks that lay
under the eastern shore. They seemed very near.
`_Yrch!_' said Legolas, falling into his own tongue.
`Orcs! ' cried Gimli.
`Gollum's doing, I'll be bound.' said Sam to Frodo. `And a nice place to choose, too. The River
seems set on taking us right into their arms! '
They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand. Every moment they
expected to feel the bite of black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead or struck the water
nearby; but there were no more hits. It was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Orcs, and in
the star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it was that the grey
cloaks Of Lórien and the grey timber of the elf-wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of
Mordor.
Stroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed
moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded
back into the night. At last, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream
again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks. Then half turning they
thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore. Under the shadow Of bushes leaning
out over the water they halted and drew breath.
Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from Lórien. Then he
sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank. Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he
turned, peering back over the River into the darkness. Across the water there were shrill cries, but
nothing could be seen.
Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into the night, seeking a mark to
shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the
sky behind. But now rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending out
dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company.
`_Elbereth Gilthoniel!_' sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did so, a dark shape, like a
cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South,
and sped towards the Company, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon it appeared as a great
winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the
water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly
cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide.
Suddenly the great bow of Lórien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the elven-string. Frodo
looked up. Almost above him the winged shape swerved. There was a harsh croaking scream, as it
fell out of the air, vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky was clean again.
There was a tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and then silence.
Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night.
After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their way along the water's edge
for some distance, until they found a small shallow bay. A few low trees grew there close to the

water, and behind them rose a steep rocky bank. Here the Company decided to stay and await the
dawn: it was useless to attempt to move further by night. They made no camp and lit no fire, but lay
huddled in the boats, moored close together.
'Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas! ' said Gimli, as he munched a
wafer of _lembas_. 'That was a mighty shot in the dark, my friend!'
'But who can say what it hit?' said Legolas.
'I cannot,' said Gimli. `But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. I liked it not at all. Too
much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria – the shadow of the Balrog,' he ended in a whisper.
'It was not a Balrog,' said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that had come upon him. 'It was
something colder. I think it was -' Then he paused and fell silent.
'What do you think? ' asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was trying to catch
a glimpse of Frodo's face.
`I think – No, I will not say,' answered Frodo. `Whatever it was, its fall has dismayed our
enemies.'
`So it seems,' said Aragorn. `Yet where they are, and how many, and what they will do next, we
do not know. This night we must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now. But what the day will show
who can tell? Have your weapons close to hand! '
Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers, and looking up at the
sky. `It's very strange,' he murmured. `The Moon's the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it
ought to be. But either it's out of its running, or I'm all wrong in my reckoning. You'll remember,
Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree: a week from the full, I
reckon. And we'd been a week on the way last night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nailparing, as if we had never stayed no time in the Elvish country.
`Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to remember several more, but I
would take my oath it was never a whole month. Anyone would think that time did not count in
there! '
`And perhaps that was the way of it,' said Frodo. `In that land, maybe, we were in a time that has
elsewhere long gone by. It was not, I think, until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we
returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don't remember any
moon, either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.'
Legolas stirred in his boat. `Nay, time does not tarry ever,' he said; `but change and growth is
not in all things and places alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and
very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them.
Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves. The passing seasons are but
ripples ever repeated in the long long stream. Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at
last.'
`But the wearing is slow in Lórien,' said Frodo. `The power of the Lady is on it. Rich are the
hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.'
'That should not have been said outside Lórien, not even to me,' said Aragorn. `Speak no more
of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your count. There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the
Elves. The old moon passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we
tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone. Time flows on to a
spring of little hope.'
The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the water. The travellers
huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather. The air grew warm and very still under the
great moist clouds that had floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River
over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. The twigs of the trees above them
began to drip.

When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad. Slowly the
dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. There was mist on the River, and white fog
swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen.
`I can't abide fog,' said Sam; `but this seems to be a lucky one. Now perhaps we can get away
without those cursed goblins seeing us.'
`Perhaps so,' said Aragorn. `But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later
on. And we must find the path, if we are to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.'
'I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any further,' said Boromir. `If
the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon these cockle-boats, and strike westward and
southward, until we come to the Entwash and cross into my own land.'
`We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,' said Aragorn, `but that is not yet agreed. And such
a course may be more perilous than it sounds. The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a
deadly peril there for those on foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The
River is at least a path that cannot be missed.'
`But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,' objected Boromir. `And even if you pass the Gates of
Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock, what will you do then? Leap down the Falls and
land in the marshes? '
`No! ' answered Aragorn. `Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Raurosfoot, and there take to the water again. Do you not know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the
North Stair, and the high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? I at
least have a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further course. There,
maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.'
Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that Frodo would follow
Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. 'It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their
friends at need,' he said, `and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. To
the tall isle I will go, but no further. There I shall turn to my home, alone if my help has not earned
the reward of any companionship.'
The day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was decided that Aragorn and
Legolas should at once go forward along the shore, while the others remained by the boats. Aragorn
hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the
smoother water beyond the Rapids.
`Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,' he said, `but that does not say that we should come
through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in
this region, for even in their great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil;
but there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It cannot yet have
perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a
few years ago, when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply.'
'Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Orcs prowl on the east-shore,'
said Boromir. `If you go forward, peril will grow with every mile, even if you find a path.'
`Peril lies ahead on every southward road,' answered Aragorn. `Wait for us one day. If we do not
return in that time, you will know that evil has indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader
and follow him as best you can.'
It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish
into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only two or three hours had passed, and it was
barely mid-day, when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again.
`All is well,' said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. 'There is a track, and it leads to a
good landing that is still serviceable. The distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a
mile below us, and they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream becomes
clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task will be to get our boats and
baggage to the old portage-way. We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-side here,

and runs under the lee of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the
northward landing lies. If it still remains, we must have passed it yesterday night. We might labour
far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I fear we must leave the River now, and make for the
portage-way as best we can from here.'
`That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,' said Boromir.
`Yet such as we are we will try it,' said Aragorn.
'Aye, we will,' said Gimli. `The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, while a Dwarf goes on, be
the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir! '
The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were taken out of the boats
and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a level space. Then the boats were drawn out of
the water and carried up. They were far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in
the elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was tough and yet
strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat. Nonetheless
it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now
had to cross. It sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, with
many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets of brambles, and sheer
dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland.
One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others toiled and scrambled after
them with the baggage. At last all was removed and laid on the portage-way. Then with little
further hindrance, save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all
together. Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded the
River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir,
but they could not see it. Twice they made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern
landing.
There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down to the shallow edge of a
little pool. It seemed to have been scooped in the river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling
down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond
it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage for those on foot.
Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in. They sat beside the
water listening to the confused rush and roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and
sleepy, and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day.
'Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,' said Boromir. `We need sleep, and
even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath by night, we are all too tired-except, no
doubt, our sturdy dwarf.'
Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.
`Let us rest as much as we can now,' said Aragorn. `Tomorrow we must journey by day again.
Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we shall have a good chance of slipping
through, unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns:
three hours off and one on guard.'
Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn. As soon as
it was fully light they started. Already the fog was thinning. They kept as close as they could to the
western side, and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls
with their feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the clouds drew down lower, and it began
to rain heavily. They drew the skin-covers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and
drifted on: little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains.
The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then suddenly the
clouds broke, and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists
were gone. Before the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, upon
shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower and the River
swifter. Now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might

meet ahead. Over them was a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and
before them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no opening could be seen.
Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles or
pillars of stone they seemed. Tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream.
A narrow gap appeared between them, and the River swept the boats towards it.
`Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings! ' cried Aragorn. `We shall pass them soon. Keep
the boats in line, and as far apart as you can! Hold the middle of the stream! '
As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him. Giants they
seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped
and fashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved through
the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn. Upon
great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes
and crannied brows they frowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards
in gesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head there was a crumbling
helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still wore, the silent wardens of a long-vanished
kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to
look up as the boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by. frail and
fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the sentinels of Númenor. So they passed into
the dark chasm of the Gates.
Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far off was the dim sky. The
black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed over them. Frodo crouching over his knees
heard Sam in front muttering and groaning: `What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get
out of this boat, and I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! '
`Fear not! ' said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw Strider, and yet not Strider;
for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer there. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud
and erect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was
blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to his own land.
'Fear not! ' he said. `Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anárion, my
sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil
Isildur's son heir of Elendil, has nought to dread! '
Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: `Would that Gandalf were here! How
my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my own city! But whither now shall I go? '
The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing
stone. It bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a
tall gap of light before him, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot
through, out into a wide clear light.
The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. The pent waters spread
out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with
trees, but their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three
peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them, an island in
the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came
up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away.
`Behold Tol Brandir! ' said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. 'Upon the left stands Amon
Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of Hearing and of Sight. In the days of the great
kings there were high seats upon them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of man
or beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them. I
hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.'
The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that flowed through the
middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their
way. The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and red. Here and

there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the twilight. Rauros
was roaring with a great voice. Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers
came at last under the shadow of the hills.
The tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. They could go no further
without choice between the east-way and the west. The last stage of the Quest was before them.
_Chapter 10_
The Breaking of the Fellowship
Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western side under the shadow of
Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first
gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores
of the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass.
'Here we will rest tonight,' said Aragorn. `This is the lawn of Parth Galen: a fair place in the
summer days of old. Let us hope that no evil has yet come here.'
They drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made their camp. They set a
watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies. If Gollum had contrived to follow them, he
remained unseen and unheard. Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing
often in his sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn it was to
watch.
`Why are you waking? ' asked Frodo. `It is not your watch.'
`I do not know,' answered Aragorn; `but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep. It
would be well to draw your sword.'
`Why? ' said Frodo. `Are enemies at hand? '
`Let us see what Sting may show,' answered Aragorn.
Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the
night. `Orcs! ' he said. `Not very near, and yet too near, it seems.'
`I feared as much,' said Aragorn. `But maybe they are not on this side of the River. The light of
Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon
Lhaw. I have never heard before of Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in
these evil days, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin. We must go
warily tomorrow.'
The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes
of a great burning. The rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it
climbed above them into a clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo
looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the running water.
High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting one head above
another; and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of
stone. Many birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be seen.
When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. `The day has come at last,' he said:
'the day of choice which we have long delayed. What shall now become of our Company that has
travelled so far in fellowship? Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or
turn east to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each
may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy is on the
eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water.'
There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved.
'Well, Frodo,' said Aragorn at last. `I fear that the burden is laid upon you. You are the Bearer
appointed by the Council. Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you.
I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he

had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice
would still wait on you. Such is your fate.'
Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. `I know that haste is needed, yet I cannot
choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer, and I will speak. Let me be alone! '
Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. `Very well, Frodo son of Drogo,' he said. `You shall
have an hour, and you shall be alone. We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of
call.'
Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching his master with great
concern, shook his head and muttered: 'Plain as a pikestaff it is, but it's no good Sam Gamgee
putting in his spoke just now.' ,
Presently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the others restrained
themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed
out of sight in the trees at the foot of Amon Hen.
Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards
the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places
stairs of stone had been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of trees.
For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he came to a grassy place. Rowantrees grew about it, and in the midst was a wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon the
East and was filled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the River, far
below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the
untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.
He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring eastwards but seeing little
with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he
recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words. Time went on, and
still he was no nearer to a choice.
Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that something was behind
him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up and turned; but all that he saw to his
surprise was Boromir, and his face was smiling and kind.
`I was afraid for you, Frodo,' he said, coming forward. `If Aragorn is right and Orcs are near,
then none of us should wander alone, and you least of all: so much depends on you. And my heart
too is heavy. May I stay now and talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me.
Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together may perhaps
find wisdom.'
`You are kind,' answered Frodo. 'But I do not think that any speech will help me. For I know
what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it, Boromir: afraid.'
Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in the branches of the
trees. Frodo shivered.
Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. `Are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly? '
he said. `I wish to help you. You need counsel in your hard choice. Will you not take mine? '
'I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,' said Frodo. 'And it would seem
like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.'
`Warning? Warning against what? ' said Boromir sharply.
'Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal of the burden that is laid on
me. Against-well, if it must be said, against trust in the strength and truth of Men.'
`Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country, though you knew it not.'
'I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is changing. The walls of Minas Tirith
may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If they fail, what then? '
'We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they will not fail.'
'No hope while the Ring lasts,' said Frodo.

'Ah! The Ring! ' said Boromir, his eyes lighting. 'The Ring! Is it not a strange fate that we
should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only
for an instant in the House of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? '
Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange gleam in Boromir's eyes,
yet his face was still kind and friendly. 'It is best that it should lie hidden,' he answered.
'As you wish. I care not,' said Boromir. 'Yet may I not even speak of it? For you seem ever to
think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: of its evil uses not of its good. The world is
changing, you say. Minas Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were
with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us? '
'Were you not at the Council? ' answered Frodo. `Because we cannot use it, and what is done
with it turns to evil.'
Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. 'So you go on,' he cried. 'Gandalf, Elrond – all
these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves they may be right. These elves and half-elves
and wizards, they would come to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely
timid. But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We of Minas Tirith
have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not desire the power of wizard-lords, only
strength to defend ourselves, strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to
light the -Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad not to use it, to use
the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the ruthless, these alone will achieve victory.
What could not a warrior do in this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he
refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would drive the
hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!'
Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed to have forgotten
Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the mustering of men; and he drew plans for
great alliances and glorious victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty
king, benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms.
'And they tell us to throw it away!' he cried. `I do not say _destroy_ it. That might be well, if
reason could show any hope of doing so. It does not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a
halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for
himself. Folly!
'Surely you see it, my friend?' he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo again. `You say that you
are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon you. But is it not really your good sense that
revolts?'
'No, I am afraid,' said Frodo. 'Simply afraid. But I am glad to have heard you speak so fully. My
mind is clearer now.'
`Then you will come to Minas Tirith? ' cried Boromir. His eyes were shining and his face eager.
`You misunderstand me,' said Frodo.
'But you will come, at least for a while? ' Boromir persisted. 'My city is not far now; and it is
little further from there to Mordor than from here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you
need news of what the Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,' he said.
`You need rest before your venture. if go you must.' He laid his hand on the hobbit's shoulder in
friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly
away, and eyed with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in
strength.
`Why are you so unfriendly? ' said Boromir. `I am a true man, neither thief nor tracker. I need
your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not
at least let me make trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! '
`No! no! ' cried Frodo. 'The Council laid it upon me to bear it.'
`It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,' cried Boromir. `How it angers me! Fool!
Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and ruining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the

Ring, it is the men of Númenor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might
have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me! '
Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them. `Come,
come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why not get rid of it? Why not be free of your
doubt and fear? You can lay the blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and
took it by force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he sprang over the
stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire was in
his eyes.
Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only one thing he could
do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger, even as
Boromir sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly
about, seeking here and there among the rocks and trees.
'Miserable trickster!' he shouted. `Let me get my hands on you! Now I see your mind. You will
take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch.
Curse you and all halflings to death and darkness! ' Then, catching his foot on a stone, he fell
sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him
down; then suddenly he wept.
He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. 'What have I said? ' he cried.
`What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called. 'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed.
Come back! '
There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already far away, leaping
blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce
face of Boromir, and his burning eyes.
Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping for breath. He saw as
through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, and surrounded with a crumbling
battlement; and in the middle, set upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of
many steps. Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that had clambered
upon the throne of mountain-kings.
At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only
shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions:
small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound,
only bright living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was sitting upon
the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Númenor. Eastward he looked
into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the
Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken
teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, the pinnacle of
Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below his very feet the Great River curled
like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow
played upon the fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of seabirds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and silver sea, rippling in
endless lines.
But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains were crawling like
anthills: orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes. Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was
deadly strife of Elves and Men and fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was
over Moria; smoke rose on the borders of Lórien.
Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard. From the havens
of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen,
spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark
Lord was in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it seemed. and
beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud and fair upon its mountain-seat; its battlements

glittered with steel, and its turrets were bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But
against Minas Tirith was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling
his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the grinning gates of Minas Morgul.
and the haunted Mountains, and it looked upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of
Mordor. Darkness lay there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was
burning, and a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon
battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw
it: Barad-dûr, Fortress of Sauron. All hope left him.
And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep. He knew
that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager will was there. It leaped towards him; almost
like a finger he felt it, searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly
where he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself from the seat,
crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.
He heard himself crying out: _Never, never!_Or was it: _Verily I come, I come to you_? He
could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another
thought: _Take it off! Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!_
The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing points,
he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware of himself again. Frodo, neither the Voice nor the
Eye: free to choose, and with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his
finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black shadow seemed to pass like
an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and groped out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean
and blue and birds sang in every tree.
Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was firm and his heart lighter.
He spoke aloud to himself. `I will do now what I must,' he said. 'This at least is plain: the evil of the
Ring is already at work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more
harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too dear to me: poor old Sam,
and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there,
now Boromir has fallen into evil. I will go alone. At once.'
He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir had found him. Then
he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below.
'They'll be hunting for me,' he said. `I wonder how long I have been away. Hours, I should
think.' He hesitated. 'What can I do? ' he muttered. 'I must go now or I shall never go. I shan't get a
chance again. I hate leaving them, and like this without any explanation. But surely they will
understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?'
Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and passed down the hill,
less than a rustle of the wind.
The others remained long by the river-side. For some time they had been silent, moving
restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and they were talking. Every now and again
they made efforts to speak of other things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned
Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of its great
works that could still be seen in this strange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the
seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and
words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why was he
hesitating?
`He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,' said Aragorn. 'And well he may. It
is now more hopeless than ever for the Company to go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum,
and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the
Fire and the destruction of the Burden.
`We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord Denethor and all his
men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond his power: either to keep the Burden

secret. or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes to take it. Which way would any
of us choose in Frodo's place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.'
'Grievous is our loss,' said Legolas. 'Yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid. Why
cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas
Tirith.'
`And so should I,' said Gimli. 'We, of course, were only sent to help the Bearer along the road,
to go no further than we wished; and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount
Doom. Hard was my parting from Lothlórien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have
reached the last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose Minas Tirith, but
if he does not, then I follow him.'
`And I too will go with him,' said Legolas. `It would be faithless now to say farewell.'
'It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,' said Aragorn. 'But if he goes east, then all need
not go with him; nor do I think that all should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for
three or two, or one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three companions:
Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself. Boromir will return to his own city,
where his father and his people need him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc
and Peregrin, if Legolas is not willing to leave us.'
`That won't do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and I always intended to go
wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not realize what that would mean. It seemed different
so far away, in the Shire or in Rivendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why
can't we stop him?'
'We must stop him,' said Pippin. `And that is what he is worrying about, I am sure. He knows we
shan't agree to his going east. And he doesn't like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow.
Imagine it: going off to Mordor alone! ' Pippin shuddered. 'But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought to
know that he hasn't got to ask. He ought to know that if we can't stop him, we shan't leave him.'
'Begging your pardon,' said Sam. 'I don't think you understand my master at all. He isn't
hesitating about which way to go. Of course not! What's the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him,
I mean, begging your pardon, Master Boromir,' he added, and turned. It was then that they
discovered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, was no
longer there.
`Now where's he got to? ' cried Sam, looking worried. 'He's been a bit queer lately, to my mind.
But anyway he's not in this business. He's off to his home, as he always said; and no blame to him.
But Mr. Frodo, he knows he's got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can. But he's _afraid_. Now it's
come to the point, he's just plain terrified. That's what his trouble is. Of course he's had a bit of
schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left home, or he'd be so terrified he'd just fling the Ring
in the River and bolt. But he's still too frightened to start. And he isn't worrying about us either:
whether we'll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's another thing that's bothering
him. If he screws himself up to go, he'll want to go alone. Mark my words! We're going to have
trouble when he comes back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.'
'I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,' said Aragorn. `And what shall we do, if
you prove right? '
'Stop him! Don't let him go! ' cried Pippin.
'I wonder? ' said Aragorn. `He is the Bearer, and the fate of the Burden is on him. I do not think
that it is our part to drive him one way or the other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we
tried. There are other powers at work far stronger.'
`Well, I wish Frodo would "screw himself up" and come back. and let us get it over,' said
Pippin. `This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up? '
`Yes,' said Aragorn. 'The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing away. We must call for
him.'

At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and walked towards them
without speaking. His face looked grim and sad. He paused as if counting those that were present,
and then sat down aloof, with his eyes on the ground.
`Where have you been, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn. `Have you seen Frodo? '
Boromir hesitated for a second. `Yes, and no,' he answered slowly. `Yes: I found him some way
up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry
and he left me. He vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before. though I have heard of
it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I thought he would return to
you.'
'Is that all that you have to say? ' said Aragorn, looking hard and not too kindly at Boromir.
`Yes,' he answered. `I will say no more yet.'
`This is bad!' cried Sam, jumping up. `I don't know what this Man has been up to. Why should
Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn't ought to have; and if he has, goodness knows what may have
happened!'
'But he wouldn't keep it on`' said Merry. `Not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor, like
Bilbo used to.'
`But where did he go? Where is he? ' cried Pippin. 'He's been away ages now.'
`How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn.
`Half an hour, maybe,' he answered. `Or it might be an hour. I have wandered for some time
since. I do not know! I do not know! ' He put his head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief.
`An hour since he vanished! ' shouted Sam. `We must try and find him at once. Come on! '
`Wait a moment! ' cried Aragorn. `We must divide up into pairs, and arrange-here, hold on!
Wait! '
It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. Merry and Pippin had
followed, and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore, shouting: _Frodo!
Frodo!_ in their clear, high hobbit-voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or
madness seemed to have fallen on the Company.
`We shall all be scattered and lost,' groaned Aragorn. `Boromir! I do not know what part you
have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after those two young hobbits, and guard them at
the least, even if you cannot find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of
him. I shall return soon.'
Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he reached the little lawn
among the rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, panting and calling, _Frodo!_
`Come with me, Sam! ' he said. `None of us should be alone. There is mischief about. I feel it. I
am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen, to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart
guessed, Frodo went this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' He sped up the path.
Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and soon fell behind. He had
not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead. Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped
his hand to his head.
`Whoa, Sam Gamgee! ' he said aloud. `Your legs are too short, so use your head! Let me see
now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; but he hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr.
Frodo badly. He screwed himself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where
to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel hard.'
Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. 'Steady, Gamgee! ' he said. `Think,
if you can! He can't fly across rivers, and he can't jump waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's got to
get back to the boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning! '
Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up he got and ran on. He
came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the
water. No one was there. There seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them.

He stood gazing for a moment. stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the bank all by itself.
With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat slipped into the water.
`Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! ' called Sam, and flung himself from the bank, clutching at the
departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep
swift water. Gurgling he went under, and the River closed over his curly head.
An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and the boat put about.
Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was
staring in his round brown eyes.
`Up you come, Sam my lad! ' said Frodo. `Now take my hand! '
`Save me, Mr. Frodo! ' gasped Sam. `I'm drownded. I can't see your hand.'
`Here it is. Don't pinch, lad! I won't let you go. Tread water and don't flounder, or you'll upset
the boat. There now, get hold of the side, and let me use the paddle! '
With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank. and Sam was able to scramble out,
wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and stepped ashore again.
`Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! ' he said.
'Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard! ' said Sam shivering. `That's hard, trying to go without me and all. If
I hadn't a guessed right, where would you be now? '
`Safely on my way.'
`Safely! ' said Sam. `All alone and without me to help you? I couldn't have a borne it, it'd have
been the death of me.'
'It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,' said Frodo and I could not have borne that.'
`Not as certain as being left behind,' said Sam.
`But I am going to Mordor.'
`I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you.'
`Now, Sam,' said Frodo, `don't hinder me! The others will be coming back at any minute. If they
catch me here. I shall have to argue and explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to
get off. But I must go at once. It's the only way.'
`Of course it is,' answered Sam. 'But not alone. I'm coming too, or neither of us isn't going. I'll
knock holes in all the boats first.'
Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. `Leave one! 'he said.
`We'll need it. But you can't come like this without your gear or food or anything.'
'Just hold on a moment, and I'll get my stuff!' cried Sam eagerly. 'It's all ready. I thought we
should be off today.' He rushed to the camping place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo
had laid it when he emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some
extra packages of food, and ran back.
`So all my plan is spoilt! ' said Frodo. `It is no good trying to escape you. But I'm glad, Sam. I
cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is plain that we were meant to go together. We will go,
and may the others find a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them
again.'
`Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam.
So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo paddled away from the
shore, and the River bore them swiftly away. down the western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of
Tol Brandir. The roar of the great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was
hard work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive the boat eastward
towards the far shore.
At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon Lhaw. There they found a
shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high above the water, and hid it as well as they could
behind a great boulder. Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would
bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of Shadow.

Here ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring.
The second part is called THE TWO TOWERS, since the events recounted in it are dominated
by ORTHANC, the citadel of Saruman, and the fortress of MINAS MORGUL that guards the
secret entrance to Mordor; it tells of the deeds and perils of all the members of the now sundered
fellowship, until the coming of the Great Darkness.
The third part tells of the last defence against the Shadow, and the end of the mission of the
Ring-bearer in THE RETURN OF THE KING.

ORELHA
A Sociedade do Anel é a primeira parte da grande obra de ficção fantástica de J. R. R.
Tolkien,
O Senhor dos Anéis.
É impossível transmitir ao novo leitor todas as qualidades e o alcance do livro.
Alternadamente cômica, singela, épica, monstruosa e diabólica, a narrativa desenvolve-se
em meio a inúmeras mudanças de cenários e de personagens, num mundo imaginário
absolutamente convincente em seus detalhes. Nas palavras do romancista Richard Hughes,
"quanto à amplitude imaginativa, a obra praticamente não tem paralelos e é quase
igualmente notável na sua vividez e na habilidade narrativa, que mantêm o leitor
preso página após página".
Tolkien criou em O Senhor dos Anéis uma nova mitologia, num mundo inventado que
demonstrou possuir um poder de atração atemporal.
Ilustração da capa Geoff Taylor
*****

A Sociedade do Anel
Numa cidadezinha indolente do Condado, um jovem hobbit é encarregado de uma imensa
tarefa.
Deve empreender uma perigosa viagem através da Terra-média até as Fendas da Perdição,
e lá destruir o Anel do Poder - a única coisa que impede o domínio maléfico do Senhor do
Escuro.

As Duas Torres
A comitiva do Anel se divide, Froo e Sam continuam a viagem, descendo o Grande Rio Anduim
- mas não tão sozinhos assim, pois uma figura misteriosa segue todos os passos...

O Retorno do Rei
A sombra dos exércitos do Senhor do Escuro cresce cada vez mais. Homens, anoões e elfos
unem-se
para lutar contra a Escuridão. Enquanto isso, Frodo e Sam penetram na terra de Mordor, em
sua
empreitada heróica para destruir o Anel.

PREFÁCIO

Esta história cresceu conforme foi sendo contada, até se tornar uma história da Grande
Guerra do Anel, incluindo muitas passagens da história ainda mais antiga que
a precedeu. O conto foi iniciado logo depois que o Hobbit foi escrito e antes de
sua publicação, em 1937; mas não
continuou nessa seqüência, pois eu queria primeiro completar e colocar em ordem a
mitologia e as lendas dos Dias Antigos, que já vinham tomando forma havia alguns
anos. Quis fazer isso para minha própria satisfação,
e tinha alguma esperança de que outras pessoas ficassem interessadas nesse trabalho,
especialmente por ser ele fruto de uma inspiração primordialmente lingüística,
e por ter sido iniciado a fim de fornecer o pano de fundo "histórico" necessário para as
línguas élficas.
Quando aqueles a quem pedi opinião e aconselhamento corrigiram alguma esperança por
nenhuma esperança, eu voltei à seqüência, encorajado pelos leitores que solicitavam
mais informações sobre os hobbits e suas aventuras. Mas a história foi levada
irresistivelmente em direção ao mundo mais antigo e tornou-se, por assim dizer, um
relato de seu fim e extinção, antes que o início e o meio tivessem sido contados.
O processo havia começado enquanto eu estava escrevendo O Hobbit, no qual já havia
algumas referências ao material mais antigo: Elrond, Gondolin, os Altos-Elfos e os
orcs, além de passagens que surgiram espontaneamente e tratavam de coisas mais
elevadas ou profundas ou obscuras do que poderiam parecer à primeira vista: Durin, Moria,
Gandalf, o Necromante e o Anel. A descoberta da importância dessas passagens
e de sua relação com as histórias antigas revelou a Terceira Era e seu apogeu na Guerra
do Anel.
Aqueles que pediram por mais informações sobre os hobbits finalmente as conseguiram, mas
tiveram de esperar um longo tempo, pois a composição de
O Senhor dos Anéis
aconteceu em intervalos entre os anos de 1936 e 1949, um período no qual eu tinha muitos
deveres que não negligericiei, e muitos outros interesses como estudante
e professor que freqüentemente me absorviam. A demora, sem dúvida, aumentou com o estouro
da guerra em 1939, e no final desse ano eu ainda não tinha terminado o
Livro 1. Apesar da escuridão dos cinco anos seguintes, descobri que a história não Podia
ser inteiramente abandonada, e continuei de maneira árdua, principalMente
à noite, até parar perante o túmulo de Balin em Moria. Ali fiz uma Pausa prolongada. Já
se passara quase um ano quando comecei de novo, e
#XII
então cheguei a Lothlórien e ao Grande Rio, no final de 1941. No ano seguinte escrevi os
primeiros rascunhos do material que agora representa o Livro III e os inícios
dos Capítulos I e III do Livro V, e ali, quando os faróis se iluminaram em Anórien e
Théoden chegou ao Vale Harg, eu parei. A previsão falhara e não havia tempo
para reconsiderar.
Foi durante 1944 que, deixando as pontas soltas e as perplexidades
de uma guerra
que eu tinha por tarefa conduzir, ou ao menos reportar, eu me forcei a

lidar com a viagem de Frodo a Mordor. Esses capítulos, que finalmente se tornaram o Livro
IV, foram escritos e enviados em forma de seriado ao meu filho, Christopher,
que naquela época estava na África do Sul com a Royal Air Force. Todavia, passaram-se
mais cinco anos até o Conto chegar ao seu fim atual; nesse tempo, troquei de
casa, de cargo e de universidade, e, embora os dias fossem menos sombrios, não eram menos
árduos. Então, quando o "final" fora atingido, a história inteira precisava
ser revisada e, na verdade, em grande parte reescrita. E precisava ser datilografada, e
redatílografada, por mim; o custo do trabalho de um profissional que usava
os dez dedos estava além das minhas possibilidades.
O Senhor dos Anéis foi lido por muitas pessoas desde que finalmente foi lançado na forma
impressa, e eu gostaria de dizer algumas coisas aqui, com referência às
muitas suposições ou opiniões, que obtive ou li, a respeito dos motivos e do significado
da história.
O motivo principal foi o desejo de um contador de histórias
de tentar fazer uma história realmente longa, que prendesse a atenção dos leitores, que
os divertisse, que os deliciasse e às vezes, quem sabe, os excitasse ou emocionasse
profundamente. Como parâmetro eu tinha apenas meus próprios sentimentos a respeito do que
seria atraente ou comovente, e para muitos o parâmetro foi inevitavelmente
uma falha constante. Algumas pessoas que leram o livro, ou que de qualquer forma fizeram
uma crítica dele, acharam-no enfadonho, absurdo ou desprezível; e eu não
tenho razões para reclamar, uma vez que tenho opiniões similares a respeito do trabalho
dessas pessoas, ou dos tipos de obras que elas evidentemente preferem. Mas,
mesmo do ponto de vista de muitos que gostaram de minha história, há muita coisa que
deixa a desejar. Talvez não seja possível numa história longa agradar a todos
em todos os pontos, nem desagradar a todos nos mesmos pontos; pois, pelas cartas que
recebi, percebo que as passagens ou capítulos que para alguns são uma lástima
são especialmente aprovados por outros. O leitor mais crítico de todos, eu mesmo, agora
encontra muitos defeitos, menores e maiores, mas, felizmente, não tendo a
obrigação de criticar o livro ou escrevê-lo novamente, passará sobre eles em silêncio,
com a exceção de um defeito que foi notado por alguns: o livro é curto demais.
Quanto a qualquer significado oculto ou "mensagem", na intenção do autor estes não
existem.
O livro não é nem alegórico e nem se refere a fatos
#XIII
contemporâneos. Conforme a história se desenvolvia, foi criando raizes (no passado) e
lançou ramos inesperados: mas seu tema principal foi definido no início pela
inevitável escolha do Anel como o elo entre este livro e o Hobbit. O capítulo crucial, "A
sombra do passado", é uma das partes mais antigas do conto. Foi escrito
muito antes que o prenúncio de 1939 se tornasse uma ameaça de desastre inevitável, e
desse ponto a história teria sido desenvolvida essencialmente na mesma linha,
mesmo que o desastre tivesse sido evitado. Suas fontes são coisas que já estavam
presentes na mente muito antes, ou em alguns casos já escritas, e pouco ou nada
foi modificado pela guerra que começou em 1939 ou suas seqüelas.
A verdadeira guerra não se assemelha à guerra lendária em seu pro cesso ou em sua
conclusão. Se ela houvesse inspirado ou conduzido o desenvolvimento da lenda, então
certamente o Anel teria sido apreendido e usado contra Sauron; este não teria sido
aniquilado, mas escravizado, e Baraddúr não teria sido destruída, mas ocupada.
Saruman, não conseguindo se apoderar do Anel, teria em meio à confusão e às traições da
época encontrado em Mordor as conexões perdidas em suas proprias pesquisas
sobre a Tradição do Anel, e logo teria feito um Grande Anel para si próprio, com o qual
poderia desafiar o pretenso soberano da Terra-média. Nesse
conflito, ambos os lados teriam considerado os hobbits com ódio e desprezo: estes não
teriam sobrevivido por muito tempo, nem mesmo como escravos.
outros arranjos poderiam ser criados de acordo com os gostos
ou as visões
daqueles que gostam de alegorias ou referências tópicas. Mas eu cordialmente

desgosto de alegorias em todas as suas manifestações, e sempre foi assim desde que me
tornei adulto e perspicaz o suficiente para detectar sua presença. Gosto muito
mais de histórias, verdadeiras ou inventadas, com sua aplicabilidade variada ao
pensamento e à experiência dos leitores. Acho que muitos confundem "aplicabilidade"
com "alegoria"; mas a primeira reside na liberdade do leitor, e a segunda na dominação
proposital do autor.
É claro que um autor não consegue evitar ser afetado por sua própria experiência, mas os
modos pelos quais os germes da história usam o solo da experiência são extremamente
complexos, e as tentativas de definição do processo são, na melhor das hipóteses,
suposições feitas a partir de evidências inadequadas e ambíguas. Também não é verdadeiro,
embora seja naturalmente atraente, quando as vidas de um autor e de um crítico se
justapõem, supor que os movimentos do pensamento e os eventos das épocas comuns
a ambos tenham sido necessariamente as influências mais poderosas. Na verdade, é preciso
estar pessoalmente sob a sombra da guerra para sentir totalmente sua opressão;
mas, conforme os anos passam, parece que fica cada vez mais esquecido o fato de que ser
apanhado na juventude por

1914 não foi uma experiência menos terrível do que ficar envolvido com
1939 e os anos seguintes. Em 1918, todos os meus amigos íntimos, com a exceção de um,
estavam mortos. Ou, para falar de um assunto menos triste: algumas pessoas
supuseram que "O expurgo do Condado" reflete a situação da Inglaterra na época em que eu
terminava minha história. Isso não é verdade. Esse capítulo é uma parte
essencial do enredo, previsto desde o início, embora neste episódio tenha sido modificado
pelo modo como o caráter de Saruman se configura na história, sem, é preciso
que eu diga, qualquer significado alegórico ou referência política de qualquer tipo. Ele
tem de fato alguma base na experiência, embora pequena (a situação económica
era totalmente diferente), e muito anterior. O lugar em que vivi na infância estava sendo
lamentavelmente destruido antes que eu completasse dez anos, numa época
em que automóveis eram objetos raros (eu nunca tinha visto um) e os homens ainda
estavam construindo ferrovias suburbanas. Recentemente vi num jornal a fotografia
da ruína do outrora próspero moinho de milho ao lado de seu lago que muito tempo atrás me
parecia tão importante. Jamais gostei da aparência do Moleiro jovem, mas
seu pai, o Moleiro velho, tinha uma barba preta, e seu nome não era
Ruivão.

PRóLOGO
A respeito de hobbits

Em grande parte, este livro trata de hobbits, e através de suas páginas o leitor pode
descobrir muito da personalidade deles e um pouco de sua história. Informações
adicionais podem ser obtidas na seleção feita a partir do Livro Vermelho do Marco
Ocidental, já publicada sob o título de
O Hobbit. Essa história originou-se dos
primeiros capítulos do Livro Vermelho, escritos pelo próprio Bilbo, o primeiro
hobbit a se tornar famoso no mundo todo, e
chamados por ele de Lá e de Volta Outra Vez, porque relatavam a sua viagem
para o Leste e sua volta: uma aventura que mais tarde envolveria todos os hobbits
nos grandes acontecimentos daquela Era relatados aqui.
Entretanto, muitos podem desejar desde o início saber mais sobre esse povo notável, uma
vez que alguns podem não possuir o primeiro livro. Para esses leitores, aqui

vão algumas notas sobre os pontos mais importantes dos hobbits, e um rápido resumo da
primeira aventura.
Os hobbits são um povo discreto mas muito antigo, mais numeroso outrora do que é hoje em
dia. Amam a paz e a tranqüilidade e uma boa terra lavrada: uma região campestre
bem organizada e bem cultivada era seu refúgio favorito. Hoje, como no passado, não
conseguem entender ou gostar de máquinas mais complicadas que um fole de forja,
um moinho de água ou um tear manual, embora sejam habilidosos com ferramentas. Mesmo nos
tempos antigos, eles geralmente se sentiam intimidados pelas "Pessoas Grandes",
que é como nos chamam, e atualmente nos evitam com pavor e estão se tornando dificeis de
encontrar. Têm ouvidos agudos e olhos perspicazes, e, embora tenham tendência
a acumular gordura na barriga e a não se apressar desnecessariamente, são ligeiros e
ágeis em seus movimentos. Possuem, desde o início, a arte de desaparecer rápida
e silenciosamente, quando pessoas grandes que não desejam encontrar aparecem pelos
caminhos aos trambolhões; e desenvolveram essa arte a tal ponto que para os homens
ela pode parecer magia. Mas os hobbits na verdade nunca estudaram qualquer tipo de magia,
e sua habilidade para desaparecer se deve somente a um talento profissional
que a hereditariedade, a prática e uma relação íntima com a terra tornaram inimitáveis
por raças maiores e mais desengonçadas.

São um povo pequeno, menores que os anões: menos robustos e
troncudos, quer dizer, mesmo que na realidade não sejam muito mais
altos, a
Sua altura é variável, indo de 60 centímetros a 1 metro e 20 centímetros
em nossa medida. Raramente chegam a 1 metro e meio; mas eles diminuiram pelo
que dizem, e em tempos antigos eram maiores. De acordo com o Livro Vermelho, Bandobras
Túk
(Urratouro), filho de Isengrim II, tinha 1 metr e 33 centímetros de altura
e conseguia montar um cavalo. Ele só foi supera do em todos os recordes hobbitianos por
dois personagens famosos de anti gamente, mas essa interessante questão é
tratada neste livro.
Quanto aos hobbits do Condado, enfocados nesses contos, nos tempos de paz e prosperidade
eram um povo alegre. Vestiam-se com cores vivas gostando notadamente de
verde
e amarelo, mas raramente usavam sapatos uma vez que seus pés tinham solas grossas como
couro e eram cobertos po pêlos grossos e encaracolados, muito parecidos com
os que tinham na cabe ça, que eram geralmente castanhos. Dessa forma, o único oficio
pouco pra ticado entre eles era a manufatura de sapatos, mas tinham dedos longos
habilidosos e podiam fazer muitas outras coisas úteis e graciosas. Em
geral seus rostos eram mais simpáticos que bonitos; largos, com
olhos brilhan tes, bochechas vermelhas
e bocas prontas para rir e para comer e beber. assim eles riam, comiam e bebiam,
freqüentemente e com entusiasmo, gos tando de brincadeiras a qualquer hora, e também
de cinco refeições por dia (quando podiam tê-las). Eram hospitaleiros e adoravam festas e
presentes que ofereciam sem reservas e aceitavam com gosto.
É fato que, apesar de um estranhamento posterior, os hobbits são nossos parentes: muito
mais proximos que os elfos, ou mesmo que os anões. An tigamente, falavam
a língua dos homens, à sua própria maneira, e em gran de parte gostavam e desgostavam das
mesmas coisas que os homens.
Mas qual é exatamente nosso parentesco não
se pode mais descobrir. A orige dos hobbits se situa nos Dias Antigos, agora perdidos e
esquecidos.
Apenas os elfos preservam registros dessa época extinta, e suas
tradições trata quase que inteiramente de sua própria história, na qual os homens apare
cem raramente e os hobbits não são mencionados. Mas não há dúvida
de que os

hobbits, de fato, viveram sossegadamente na Terra-média por mui tos anos antes que
qualquer outro povo tomasse conhecimento deles. E es tando o mundo afinal de contas
cheio de inumeráveis criaturas estranhas, esse pequeno povo parecia ter muito pouca
importância. Mas na época de Bilbo e de Frodo, seu herdeiro, eles repentinamente
se tornaram, sem qu o desejassem, tanto importantes quanto renomados, e atrapalharam as
deliberações dos Sábios e dos Grandes.
Aqueles dias, a Terceira Era da Terra-média, já se passaram há muito tempo, e o formato
de todas as terras foi mudado; mas as regiões
habitadas

pelos hobbits dessa época são sem dúvida as mesmas onde eles ainda permanecem: o
Noroeste do Velho Mundo, a Leste do Mar. De sua terra natal, os hobbits da época
de Bilbo não preservavam nenhum conhecimento. o amor por aprender coisas novas (que não
fossem registros genealógicos) estava longe de ser comum entre eles, mas
ainda restavam alguns nas famílias mais antigas que estudavam seus próprios livros, e até
reuniam relatos de tempos antigos e terras distantes feitos por elfos,
anões e homens. Seus próprios registros começaram apenas depois da fundação do Condado, e
suas lendas mais antigas raramente são anteriores aos seus Dias Errantes.
Entretanto, está claro, a partir dessas lendas e das evidências de suas palavras e
hábitos peculiares, que os hobbits, como muitos outros povos, se dirigiram para
o Oeste no passado. Suas histórias mais antigas parecem ser de um tempo em que eles
moravam nos vales superiores de Anduin, entre a orla da Grande Floresta Verde
e as Montanhas Sombrias. Já não se conhece com certeza a razão pela qual empreenderam a
tarefa árdua e perigosa de atravessar as montanhas e chegar até
Eriador.
Seus próprios depoimentos falam da multiplicação dos homens na terra, e de uma sombra que
desceu sobre a floresta, de modo que esta ficou escura e seu nome passou
a ser Floresta das Trevas.
Antes de atravessar as montanhas, os hobbits já se haviam dividido em três raças
relativamente diferentes: Pés-peludos, Grados e Cascalvas. Os Péspeludos tinham
a pele mais escura, eram menores e mais baixos, não tinham barbas ou botas; suas mãos e
pés eram destros e ágeis e eles preferiam as regiões serranas e as encostas
de montanhas. Os Grados tinham uma constituição mais encorpada e pesada: suas mãos e pés
eram maiores, e preferiam planícies e regiões banhadas por rios. Os Cascalvas
tinham a pele e o cabelo mais claros, eram mais altos e esguios que os outros e eram
amantes de árvores e florestas.
Os Pés-peludos tinham muito a ver com os anões em épocas antigas, e viveram por muito
tempo nos pés das montanhas. Migraram cedo em direção ao oeste, e vagaram
até Eriador chegando ao Topo do Vento, enquanto os outros ainda estavam nas Terras Ermas.
Eram a variedade mais comum e representativa de hobbits, e sem dúvida
a
mais numerosa. Eram os mais inclinados a se acomodar em um único lugar, e preservaram por
mais tempo o hábito ancestral de viver em túneis e tocas.
Os Grados permaneceram por mais tempo ao longo das margens do Grande rio Anduin, e eram
menos reservados em relação aos homens.
Migraranm, para o Oeste depois dos
Pés-peludos e seguiram o curso do Ruidoságua em direção ao sul, e ali muitos deles
moraram por um longo tempo entre
Tharbad e os limites da Terra Parda, antes de
rumar para o Norte novamente.
Os Cascalvas, os menos numerosos, eram um ramo do Norte. Tinham uM contato mais amigável
com os elfos do que os outros hobbits, e tinham

mais habilidade com línguas e música do que com trabalhos manuais. E desde antigamente
preferiam caçar a lavrar a terra. Eles cruzaram as montanhas ao norte de Valfenda
e desceram o rio Fontegris. Em Eriador, rapidamente se mesclaram com os outros tipos que
os haviam precedido, mas, sendo relativamente maiores e mais aventureiros,
eram freqüentemente tidos como líderes ou chefes entre os clãs de Pés-peludos ou de
Grados. Mesmo no tempo de Bilbo, ainda se podiam notar os fortes traços de Cascalvas
entre as famílias maiores, como os Túks e os Mestres da Terra dos Buques.
Na região oeste de Eriador, entre as Montanhas Sombrias e as Montanhas de Lún, os hobbits
encontraram tanto homens quanto elfos. Na verda de, ainda morava lá um
remanescente dos Dúnedain, os reis dos homens
que chegaram de Ponente pelo Mar; mas eles estavam desaparecendo rapidamente, e as terras
de seu Reino do Norte estavam se deteriorando por toda
a região. Havia espaço de sobra para os que chegavam, e logo os hobbits
começaram a se assentar em comunidades organizadas. Muitas de suas comunidades
mais antigas tinham desaparecido e caído em total esquecimen to na época de Bilbo; mas
uma das primeiras a se tornar importante ainda
permanecia, embora reduzida em tamanho; situava-se em Bri e na Floresta
Chet que ficava nas redondezas, a umas quarenta milhas do Condado.
Foi nesses tempos primordiais, sem dúvida, que os hobbits aprenderam suas letras
e começaram a escrever na maneira dos Dúnedain, que po sua vez tinham aprendido
a arte muito antes com os elfos. E nessa época
eles também esqueceram todas as línguas usadas anteriormente, e depois
disso sempre falaram a Língua Geral, o Westron, que era como a chamavam
nas terras dos reis desde Arnor até Gondor, e em toda a costa marítima desde Belfalas até
Lúri. Mesmo assim, eles ainda preservavam do
passado algumas palavras próprias, bem como seus próprios nomes de meses e dia
e uma grande quantidade de nomes de pessoas.
Por volta dessa época, as lendas entre os hobbits se tornaram pela pri meira vez
história, com uma contagem de anos. Pois foi no ano 1601 da Ter ceira Era que os
irmãos Cascalvas, Marcho e Blanco, partiram de Bri, e tendo obtido permissão do rei em
Fornost, cruzaram o escuro rio Barandum acompanhados de muitos hobbits.
Atravessaram a Ponte dos Arcos de Pedra, construída na época de poder do Reinado do
Norte, e tomaram
toda terra além dela para ali morar, entre o rio e as Colinas Distantes. Tudo
que se exigia deles era que fizessem a manutenção da Grande Ponte e de todas as outras
pontes e estradas, que facilitassem a passagem dos mensageiros do rei e
que reconhecessem seu poder.
(nota) 1. Conforme os relatos de Gondor, este rei era Argeleb II, o vigésimo da linhagem
do
Norte, que terminou com Arvedui, três séculos depois.

Assim teve início o Registro do Condado, pois o ano em que cruzaram
o rio Brandevin (assim rebatizado pelos hobbits) se tornou o Ano Um do condado, e todas
as datas posteriores se baseiam
nessa.
Imediatamente os hobbits do Oeste se apaixonaram por sua nova terra e lá
permaneceram, e assim rapidamente mais uma vez desapareceram da história dos
homens e dos elfos. Enquanto ainda havia um
rei, eram seus súditos nominais; mas na verdade eram governados por seus próprios líderes
e não se misturavam de
modo algum com os acontecimentos do mundo lá fora.
Na última batalha em Fornost contra o Rei dos Bruxos de Angmar, enviaram alguns arqueiros
para ajudar o rei, ou pelo menos assim afirmavam, embora nenhuma história
dos homens conforme a informação. Mas com aquela guerra o Reinado do Norte acabou; e
então os hobbits tomaram a terra para si próprios, e escolheram entre seus próprios

chefes um Tham para ocupar o lugar de autoridade do rei que havia partido. Ali, por mil
anos, tiveram poucos problemas com guerras, e prosperaram e se multiplicaram
depois da Peste Negra (R.C. 37) até o desastre do Inverno Longo e a penúria que o seguiu.
Milhares pereceram nessa época, mas os Dias de Privação
já estavam distantes na época desta história, e os hobbits tinham se acostumado novamente
com a fartura. A terra era rica e boa, e, embora já estivesse abandonada
por
muito tempo quando lá chegaram, fora bem cultivada antes, e ali o rei possuíra muitas
fazendas, plantações de milho, vinhedos e bosques.
A terra se estendia por 120 milhas desde as Colinas Distantes até a Ponte do Brandevin, e
por 150 milhas dos pântanos do norte até os charcos do sul. Os hobbits
a chamaram de Condado, sendo a região de autoridade de seu Thain e um distrito de
negócios bem-organizados; e ali, naquele canto agradável do mundo, exerceram sua
bem organizada atividade de viver e prestavam cada vez menos atenção ao mundo de fora,
onde coisas obscuras aconteciam, chegando a pensar que paz e fartura fossem
a regra na Terramédia e o direito de todas as Pessoas sensatas. Esqueceram ou ignoravam o
pouco que sabiam dos Guardiões e dos trabalhos daqueles que possibilitavam
a paz prolongada do Condado. Na verdade, eles estavam protegidos, mas deixaram de se
lembrar disso.
Em tempo algum, hobbits de qualquer tipo foram amantes da guerra, e nunca guerrearam
entre si. Em tempos antigos, é claro, viram-se freqüentemente obrigados a
lutar para se manterem num mundo difícil; mas na época de Bilbo esta já era uma história
muito antiga. A última batalha antes de esta história começar, e na verdade
a única que aconteceu dentro dos liMites do Condado, estava além da memória viva: a
Batalha dos Campos

nota 2. Dessa forma, os anos da Terceira Era no registro dos elfos e dos Dúnedam podem
ser achados somando-se 1.600 às datas do Registro do Condado.

Verdes, R.C. 1147, na qual Bandobras Túk expulsou os orcs
que tinham invadido
a região. Até mesmo o clima ficara mais ameno, e os lobos que uma
vez chegavam
famintos fugindo do Norte, durante amargos invernos brancos, eram apenas uma história
contada pelos avós. Dessa forma, embora ainda houvesse um pequeno estoque de
armas no Condado, estas eram usadas geralmente como troféus, penduradas sobre lareiras ou
nas paredes, ou reunidas no museu em Grã Cava. A Casa-mathom, era como
se chamava;
pois qualquer coisa que os hobbits não fossem utilizar
imediatamente,
mas que não quisessem jogar fora, eles chamavam de mathom. Suas
moradias
podiam vir a ficar cheias de mathoms, e muitos dos presentes que
passavam de mão em mão eram desse tipo.
Entretanto, a paz e a tranqüilidade tinham tornado este povo curiosamente resistente. Se
a situação exigisse, eram dificeis de intimidar ou
matar e eram, talvez,
tão incansavelmente afeiçoados às coisas boas quanto, quando necessário, capazes de
passar sem elas, e podiam sobreviver à ação
rude da tristeza, do clima ou do inimigo de um modo que surpreendia
aqueles que não os conheciam direito e não enxergavam além de suas barrigas e
de seus rostos bem-alimentados. Embora demorassem
para discutir e não matassem nenhum ser vivente por esporte, eram valentes quando em
apuros
, se fosse preciso sabiam ainda manejar armas. Atiravam bem com o arco
pois seus olhos eram perspicazes e certeiros no alvo. Não apenas com arco e flechas.
Se qualquer hobbit se abaixasse para pegar uma pedra era bom logo se proteger,

como bem sabiam todos os animais transgressores.
Todos os hobbits viviam originalmente em tocas no chão, ou assim acreditavam, e
nesse tipo de moradia ainda se sentiam mais à vontade; mas com o passar do tempo
foram obrigados a adotar outros tipos de habitação Na verdade, no Condado da época de
Bilbo, geralmente apenas os mais rico e os mais pobres mantinham o antigo hábito.
Os mais pobres foram viver em tocas do tipo mais primitivo, na verdade meros buracos com
apenas um ou nenhuma janela, enquanto os abastados ainda construíam versões
mais luxuosas das escavações simples de antigamente. Mas locais adequado para
esses tipos de túneis grandes e ramificados (ou smials, como os chamavam) não se
encontravam em qualquer lugar, e nas planícies e nos distritos baixos os hobbits,
conforme se multiplicavam, começaram a conb truir acima do solo. Na verdade,
mesmo nas regiões montanhosas das aldeias mais antigas, como a Vila dos Hobbits ou
Tuqueburgo, ou no
distrito principal do Condado, que se chamava Grã Cava e ficava
sobre as Colinas Brancas, havia agora muitas casas de madeira, tijolo ou pedra. Estas
eram especialmente preferidas por mineiros, ferreiros, cordoeiros e carreteiros e
outros profissionais do tipo, pois mesmo na época em que tinham tocas oni morar, os
hobbits já estavam havia muito tempo acostumados a construir oficinas e barracões.
#7
Afirmava-se que o hábito de construir celeiros e casas-grandes teve início entre os
habitantes do Pântano, na região do rio Brandevin. Os hobbits dessa região, a
Quarta Leste, eram bastante grandes e tinham pernas volumosas, e usavam botas de anões
quando o tempo estava úmido e havia
lama no chão. Mas eram conhecidos por ter uma boa quantidade de sangue Grado, como de
fato se
demonstrou pela penugem que muitos deles tinham no queixo. Nenhum dos Pés-peludos ou dos
Cascalvas tinha
qualquer sinal de barba. Na verdade, o pessoal do Pântano, e da Terra dos Buques, a leste
do Rio, que eles ocuparam posteriormente, vieram em sua maior parte para
o Condado mais tarde, procedendo do Sul; e ainda tinham muitos nomes peculiares e usavam
palavras estranhas não encontradas em nenhuma outra região do Condado.
É provável que o oficio da construção, além de muitos outros oficios, tenha sido copiado
dos Dúnedain. Mas os hobbits podem ter aprendido diretamente com os elfos,
os professores dos homens quando jovens. Pois os elfos da Alta Linhagem ainda não haviam
abandonado a Terra-média e naquela época ainda moravam nos Portos Cinzentos,
no longínquo Oeste, e em outros lugares dentro dos domínios do Condado. Três torres
élficas de tempos imemoriais ainda podiam ser vistas nas Colinas das Torres,
além das fronteiras do Oeste. Brilhavam de longe à luz da lua. A mais alta ficava mais
distante, erguendo-se solitária sobre uma colina verde. Os hobbits da Quarta
Oeste diziam que se podia ver o Mar do alto daquela torre; mas jamais se soube de um
hobbit que tivesse estado lá. Na verdade, poucos hobbits já tinham visto o Mar
ou navegado nele, e menos ainda retornaram para contar o que fizeram. A maioria dos
hobbits encarava mesmo os rios e pequenos barcos com grande apreensão, e poucos
sabiam nadar. E conforme os dias do Condado se alongavam, eles falavam cada vez menos com
os elfos, e se
tornaram receosos deles, e desconfiados daqueles que tinham
relações com eles; o Mar se tornou uma palavra ameaçadora e um sinônimo de morte, e deram
as costas para as colinas e o Oeste.
O oficio da construção pode ter vindo dos elfos ou dos homens, mas os hobbits o usavam a
sua propria maneira. Não gostavam de torres. Suas casas eram geralmente
compridas, baixas e confortáveis. Os tipos mais antigos eram, na verdade, nada mais que
imitações construídas de smials, cobertas com grama seca ou palha ou turfa,
e com paredes de certo modo arqueadas. Esse estágio, entretanto, pertenceu aos primeiros
tempos do Condado, e as construções dos hobbits tinham sido alteradas havia
muito, aprimoradas por métodos aprendidos com os anões ou desenvolvidos por eles
próprios. Uma preferência por janelas e mesmo por portas redondas era a Peculiaridade

mais importante da arquitetura hobbit.
As casas e tocas dos hobbits do Condado eram sempre grandes, e habitadas por grandes
famílias. (Bilbo
e Frodo Bolseiro, sendo solteiros, eram

muito incomuns, como eram também em muitos outros pontos, (como por
exemplo em sua amizade com os elfos.) Algumas vezes, como no caso de Túks de Grandes
Smials, ou
os Brandebuques da Sede do Brandevin, muitas gerações de parentes viviam em
(relativa) paz, juntos numa mansão ancestral e de muitos túneis. Todos os hobbits,
de qualquer modo tinham tendência a viver em clãs, e tratavam seus parentes com
muita atenção e cuidado. Desenhavam grandes e elaboradas árvores genealógicas
com ramos inumeráveis. Em se tratando de hobbits é importante lembrar quem é
parente de quem, e em que grau. Seria impossível neste livro esboçar
uma árvore genealógica que incluísse mesmo apenas os mais importantes menbros
das famílias mais importantes da época da qual esses contos trataram. As árvores
genealógicas no final do Livro Vermelho do Marco Ocidental são em si um pequeno
volume, e todos, com a exceção dos hobbits, as co siderariam excessivamente enfadonhas.
Os hobbits se deliciavam com esse tipo de coisas, quando eram precisas: gostavam
de ter os livros repletos de coisas que já conheciam, colocadas preto no
branco, sem contradições. A respeito da erva-defumo
Existe uma outra coisa a respeito dos hobbits que deve ser mencionada, um
hábito surpreendente: eles inspiravam ou inalavam, através de um tubo de barro ou
madeira,
a fumaça derivada da queima de folhas de uma erva que chamavam de erva-de-fumo
ou folhha, provavelmente uma variedade Nicotiana. Um mistério enorme envolve a origem
desse hábito peculiar, "arte", como os hobbits preferiam chamá-lo. Tudo o que se pôde
descobrir sobre isso na antiguidade
foi recolhido por Meriadoc Brandebuque (depois Mestre da Terra dos Buques), e, uma vez
que ele e o tabaco da Quarta Sul
têm um papel na história que se segue, suas observações na introdução de seu
Registro das Ervas do Condado merecem transcrição:
"Esta", diz ele, "é uma arte que se pode certamente descrever co uma invenção nossa.
Quando os hobbits começaram a fumar não se
sabe, nenhuma lenda ou história familiar questiona o assunto; por muito
tempo as pessoas do Condado fumaram varias ervas, algumas mais fortes, outr mais suaves.
Mas todos
os registros concordam com o fato de que Tobol Corneteiro, do Vale Comprido, na Quarta
Sul, cultivou pela primeira vez
a verdadeira erva-de-fumo em seus jardins na
época de Isengrim II, por volta do ano 1070 do Registro do Condado. As melhores
ervas de cultivo doméstico ainda vêm desse distrito, especialmente as variedades
hoje conhecid ascomo Folha do Vale Comprido, Velho Toby e Estrela do Sul.
#9
Como o Velho Toby encontrou a planta não está registrado, pois até
o dia de sua morte não o disse a ninguem. Sabia muito sobre ervas, mas não era um
viajante. Comenta-se que em sua juventude ele sempre ia a Bri, embora certamente
nunca tenha ido além desse ponto. Dessa forma, é muito possível que tenha conhecido essa
planta em Bri, onde atualmente, de qualquer modo, ela cresce muito bem nas
encostas da colina voltadas para o Sul. os hobbits de Bri dizem ter sido os primeiros a
realmente fumar a erva-defumo. Eles dizem, é claro, que fizeram tudo antes
das pessoas do Condado, a quem se referem como "colonos"; mas neste caso acredito que o
que dizem é correto. E certamente foi de Bri que a arte de fumar a erva
genuína se espalhou nos séculos recentes entre anões e outros povos semelhantes,
guardiões, magos, ou andarilhos, que ainda passavam indo e vindo por aquela encruzilhada

antiga. O reduto e o centro da arte podem desse modo ser encontrados na velha hospedaria
de Bri,
O Pônei Saltitante, conservada pela família de Carrapicho desde
tempos imemoriais.
Mesmo assim, as observações que fiz em minhas viagens para o Sul me convenceram
de que a erva não é nativa da nossa parte do mundo, mas veio do norte do
Anduin
inferior, e até ali foi trazida, suspeito eu, originalmente do outro lado do Mar por
homens de Ponente. Ela cresce de forma abundante em Gondor, e ali é mais rica
e maior que no Norte, onde nunca é encontrada na forma selvagem e floresce apenas em
lugares cobertos e aquecidos como o Vale Comprido. Os homens de Gondor a chamam
de doce galenas, e a estimam somente pela fragrância de suas flores. Dessa terra ela deve
ter sido levada através do Caminho Verde, durante os longos séculos entre
a vinda de Elendil e os dias atuais. Mas mesmo os Dúnedam de Gondor nos dão este crédito:
os hobbits pela primeira vez colocaram a erva em cachimbos. Nem mesmo os
magos pensaram nisso antes que nós. Apesar de um mago que eu conheço ter aderido à arte
há muito tempo,
tornando-se habilidoso nela como em qualquer outra coisa em
que se mete.
Sobre a organização do Condado
O Condado se dividia em quatro partes, as Quartas já citadas, Norte, Sul, Leste e Oeste;
e estas por sua vez novamente se dividiam em vários Povoados, que ainda
levam os nomes de algumas das famílias mais importantes, embora no tempo desta história
esses nomes não fossem mais
encontrados apenas em seus próprios povoados.
Quase todos os Túks ainda viviam na Terra dos Túks, mas não se pode dizer o mesmo de
muitas outras
famílias, como os Bolseiros e os Boffins. Para além das Quartas ficavam
#10
os Marcos Leste e Oeste: a Terra dos Buques (p. 102); e o Marco
Ocidental adicionado ao Condado em R.C. 1462.
Nessa época o Condado mal tinha um "governo". Na maioria das vezes as famílias cuidavam
de seus próprios negócios. Cultivar comida comê-la ocupava a maior parte
de seu tempo. Em outros assuntos eles eram em geral, generosos e não gananciosos, mas
satisfeitos e moderados, de
modo que terras, fazendas, oficinas e pequenos comércios
tendiam a permanecer inalterados por gerações.
Permanecia, é claro, a antiga tradição, acerca do Alto Rei de Fornost, ou Cidadela do
Norte, como chamavam o lugar ao norte do Condado. Mas não tinha havido um rei
por mais de mil anos, e mesmo as ruínas do Rei da Cidadela do norte estavam cobertas pelo
mato. Mas os hobbits ainda comentavam sobre povos selvagens e coisas perversas
(como trolls) que não tinham ouvido falar do rei. Pois eles atribuíam ao rei de outrora
todas as suas
regras essenciais; e geralmente mantinham as leis do livre-arbítrio,
pois estas eram As Regras (como diziam), tão antigas quanto justas.
É verdade que a família Túk tinha se destacado havia muito tempo pois o oficio de
Tham tinha passado a eles (dos Velhobuques) alguns séculos antes, e o chefe Túk levava
o título desde essa época. O Thain era o mestre do Tribunal do Condado, e capitão das
Tropas do Condado e dos Hobbit em-armas, mas como tribunais e exércitos só
eram
organizados em tempo de emergência, que não ocorriam mais, o título de Thain não era

habilidades de produzir em cada geração grandes personalidades de háb tos peculiares e

até de temperamento aventureiro. Esta última qualida entretanto, era atualmente mais
tolerada (nos ricos) do que
propriamente aprovada. Permaneceu o costume, entretanto,
de se referir ao chefe da família como O Túk, e de se adicionar ao seu nome, se
necessário, um
numero: como Isengrim II, por exemplo.
O único cargo oficial no Condado nessa época era o de Prefeito Grã Cava (e do Condado),
que era eleito a cada sete anos na Feira Livre
nas Colinas Brancas no Lithe, isto é, no Solstício de Verão. Como Prefeito, quase seu
único dever era presidir banquetes, oferecidos nos feriados do
Condado, que ocorriam a intervalos freqüentes.
Mas os cargos de Agente Postal e de Primeiro Condestável foram acrescentados ao de
Prefeito, de
modo que este gerenciava tanto o Serviço de Mensagens como a Patrulha.
Estes eram os únicos funcionários do Condado, e os Mensageiros eram os
mais numerosos e os mais ocupados dos dois. Os hobbits não eram, de
modo algum, todos letrados, mas
os que eram escreviam constantemente para todos os seus amigos (e para
alguns de seus parentes) que viviam em lugares mais distantes do que uma caminhada
vespertina
podia alcançar.
#11
"Condestáveis" foi o nome que os hobbits deram à sua polícia, ou ao seu
equivalente mais próximo. Eles não tinham, obviamente, uniformes (essas coisas eram
desconhecidas
por eles), só uma pena em seus chapéus; e na prática estavam mais para pastores que para
policiais, mais envolvidos
com animais perdidos que com pessoas. Havia
apenas doze deles em todo o Condado, três em cada Quarta, para Trabalho Interno. Uma
corporação
bem maior, que variava em tamanho conforme a necessidade, estava
encarregada de "bater as fronteiras" e cuidar que os forasteiros de qualquer tipo,
grandes ou pequenos, não se transformassem num incômodo.
Na época em que esta história começa, os Fronteiros, como eram chamados, tinham aumentado
bastante. Havia muitos relatos e reclamações de pessoas e criaturas estranhas
rondando as fronteiras, ou a região delas: o primeiro sinal de que nem tudo estava como
deveria estar, e sempre havia estado, a não ser nas histórias e lendas de
antigamente. Poucos perceberam o sinal, e até mesmo Bilbo não tinha qualquer noção do que
isso representava. Sessenta anos haviam se passado desde que partira em
sua memorável viagem, e estava velho mesmo em se tratando de hobbits, que
geralmente chegavam aos cem anos; mas ele evidentemente ainda conservava a
riqueza considerável que havia trazido. A quantidade nunca fora revelada a ninguem,
nem mesmo a Frodo, seu "sobrinho" favorito. E ainda guardava em segredo o Anel que havia
achado.
Sobre o Achado do Anel
Como se narra em O Hobbit, um dia chegou à porta de Bilbo o grande mago, Gandalf,
o Cinzento, e treze anões junto com ele: na realidade, ninguém mais que
Thorin
Escudo de Carvalho, descendente de reis, e seus doze companheiros de exílio. Com eles
partiu, para sua grande surpresa, numa manhã de abril, no ano de 1341, de acordo
com o Registro do Condado, na busca de grandes riquezas, o tesouro acumulado pelos anões
e pertencente aos Reis sob a Montanha abaixo de Erebor em Valle, no extremo
Leste. A busca foi bem-sucedida e o dragão que guardava o tesouro foi destruído. Mas,
embora antes que tudo estivesse terminado, a Batalha dos Cinco Exércitos tenha

sido travada e Thorin tenha sido morto, e muitos feitos imPortantes tenham acontecido, o
assunto não teria sido de muito interesse Para a história posterior, ou
merecido mais que uma nota nos longos anais da Terceira Era, se não fosse por um
"acidente".
O grupo foi assaltado Por orcs numa passagem nas Montanhas Sombrias
enquanto ia para as Terras Ermas; e então aconteceu que Bilbo ficou perdido por um tempo
nas
#12
escuras minas dos orcs sob as montanhas, e ali, quando tateava em vão no
escuro, ele pôs a mão sobre um anel que estava no chão de um túnel.
Colocou-o no bolso. Na hora, isso pareceu mera sorte.
Tentando achar a saída, Bilbo desceu até as raizes das montanhas, até
que não pudesse ir adiante. No chão do túnel ficava um lago frio, longe
da luz, e numa ilha de pedra
sobre a água vivia Gollum. Era uma criatura repugnante: remava um pequeno barco com seus
grandes pés chatos, e
escrutando com olhos pálidos e luminosos e pegando peixes cegos com longos
dedos e comendo-os crus. Comia qualquer coisa viva, até mesmo orcs, se
pudesse capturá-los e estrangulá-los sem esforço. Possuía um tesouro secreto,
que tinha chegado até ele muito tempo atrás, quando ainda vivia na luz: um anel de ouro
que fazia com que quem o usasse se tornasse
invisível. Era a única coisa que
amava, seu "precioso", e conversava com o mesmo quando não o tinha consigo. Guardava-o
seguro num
esconderijo ,um buraco em sua ilha, a não ser quando estava caçando
ou espionando orcs das minas.
Talvez ele tivesse atacado Bilbo imediatamente se estivesse com o anel quando se
encontraram; mas não estava, e o hobbit segurava uma faca
branca, que lhe servia de espada.
Então, para ganhar tempo, Gollum desafiou Bilbo para um jogo de charadas, dizendo que, se
propusesse uma
charada que Bilbo não conseguisse adivinhar, poderia matá-lo e comê-lo. Por
outro lado, se Gollum fosse derrotado, faria o ordenado por Bilbo: conduzi-lo a saída dos
túneis.
Já que estava perdido no escuro e sem esperanças, não podendo ir ir adiante e nem voltar,
Bilbo aceitou o desafio e eles propuseram um
ao outro muitas charadas. No final Bilbo ganhou o jogo, mais por sorte
ao que parece) do que por esperteza; pois tinha ficado em apuros sem ter
nenhuma charada a propor, e gritou, quando sua mão
alcançou o anel que tinha apanhado e esquecido: O que eu tenho no meu bolso? Isso Gollum
não conseguiu responder, embora tivesse exigido três chances.
As Autoridades, é verdade, discordam quanto a essa última perguta ser uma mera "pergunta"
ou uma "charada", de acordo com as regras
estritas do Jogo; mas todos concordam
que, depois de aceitá-la e tentar acertar a resposta, Golhim se obrigava a cumprir sua
promessa. E Bilbo o
pressionou a manter sua palavra, pois lhe ocorreu que essa
criatura gosmeta poderia voltar atrás, embora essas promessas fossem consideradas
sagradas, e desde antigamente apenas as criaturas mais perversas não
temiam quebrá-las.
Mas depois de muito tempo sozinho no escuro, GoIlum coração negro, e a traição morava
nele. Escapou e voltou à sua ilha, da Bilbo não sabia coisa alguma, não
muito distante na água escura. Ali, pensou, estava seu anel. Estava faminto agora, e
raivoso, e se o seu
"precioso" estivesse com ele, não temeria qualquer tipo de
arma.

Mas o anel não estava na ilha; ele o havia perdido, sumira. Seu chiado causou arrepios em
Bilbo, embora ele ainda não tivesse entendido o que havia acontecido. Mas
Gollum tinha descoberto a resposta, tarde demais. o que ele tem nos ssseus bolssssos?,
gritou ele. A luz em seus olhos era
como uma chama verde, e ele correu de
volta para matar o hobbit e recuperar seu "precioso". Bilbo percebeu o perigo em tempo, e
fugiu
cegamente pela passagem para longe da água; e mais uma vez foi
salvo por sua sorte. Pois enquanto corria colocou a mão no bolso, e o anel escorregou-lhe
no dedo. Foi assim que Gollum passou por ele sem vê-lo, e seguiu em frente
para guardar a saída, para que o "ladrão" não fugisse. Cuidadosamente, Bilbo o seguiu,
conforme ele ia em frente, xingando e conversando consigo mesmo sobre seu
"precioso"; dessa conversa Bilbo finalmente descobriu a verdade, e recuperou a esperança
na escuridão: ele próprio tinha encontrado o anel e uma chance de escapar
dos orcs e de Gollum.
Finalmente pararam perante uma abertura escondida, que levava até os portões inferiores
das minas, no lado leste das montanhas. Ali
Gollumm se agachou, farejando
e escutando, e Bilbo se sentiu tentado a matá-lo com sua espada. Mas teve pena, e embora
mantivesse o anel, no qual estava sua única esperança, não o usaria como
um recurso para matar a criatura ignóbil em desvantagem. No final, juntando toda sua
coragem, pulou por cima de
Gollum no escuro, e fugiu pela passagem, seguido
pelos gritos de ódio e desespero de seu inimigo: Ladrão, ladrão! Bolseiro! Nós
odeia ele para sempre!
É curioso o fato de que essa não é a história que Bilbo contou inicialmente a seus
companheiros. Para estes disse que Gollum havia prometido dar-lhe um presente
se ele ganhasse o jogo; mas quando Gollum foi pegá-lo em sua ilha descobriu que o
presente havia sumido: um anel mágico, que lhe tinha sido dado em seu aniversário
havia muito tempo. Bilbo adivinhou que era exatamente esse anel que ele havia encontrado,
e como tinha ganhado
o Jogo, o anel já era seu por direito. Mas, estando numa situação dificil, não disse
nada, e obrigou Golhim a mostrar-lhe a saída como recompensa em vez do presente.
Esse relato Bilbo colocou em suas memórias e parece nunca tê-lo alterado, nem mesmo
depois do Conselho de Elrond. Evidentemente isso ainda constava no Livro Vermelho
original, da mesma forma que em varias cópias e resumos. Mas muitas cópias contêm a
história verdadeira (como uma alternativa), derivada sem dúvida das notas de
Frodo ou Samwise; ambos souberam a verdade, embora não parecessem dispostos a apagar
qualquer coisa
jà escrita pelo velho hobbit.
Gandalf, entretanto, desacreditou da primeira história de Bilbo assim que a escutou
e continuou muito curioso a respeito do anel. Finalmente conseguiu saber da verdadeira
história pelo próprio Bilbo, depois de muitos
#14
questionamentos, que por um tempo estremeceram sua amizade; mas o sábio parecia
considerar a verdade importante. Embora não dissesse isso a Bilbo, ele também achava
importante, e perturbador, o fato de o bom hobbit não ter contado a verdade desde o
começo, o que era contrário aos seus hábitos. A idéia de um "presente" não era
uma mera invenção de hobbit, de qualquer forma. Ela lhe foi sugerida, como o próprio
Bilbo confessou, pela conversa de Golhim que ele por acaso ouvira; porque
Gollum,
na verdade, chamou o anel de seu "presente de aniversário" muitas vezes. Este fato
Gandalf também considerou estranho e suspeito, mas só descobriu a verdade sobre

ele depois de muitos anos, como se verá neste livro.
Sobre as aventuras posteriores de Bilbo é preciso dizer pouca coisa mais. Com a ajuda do
anel ele escapou dos
guardas-orcs no portão e reencontrou seus companheiros.
Usou o anel muitas vezes nessa viagem, principalmente para ajudar seus amigos; mas o
manteve em segredo o quanto pôde. Depois de sua volta, nunca mais falou dele
para qualquer pessoa, a não ser Gandalf e Frodo, e ninguém mais no Condado sabia de sua
existência, ou assim ele pensava. Apenas a Frodo mostrou o relato de sua
Viagem que estava escrevendo.
Sua espada, Ferroada, Bilbo pendurou sobre a lareira, e seu maravilhoso casaco de malha
de metal, presente que os anões lhe deram e que fazia parte do tesouro do
dragão, foi doado a um museu, na verdade à Casa-mathom em Grã Cava. Mas ele mantinha numa
gaveta em Bolsão a velha capa e o capuz que havia usado em suas viagens;
e o anel, pendurado numa corrente fina, era mantido em seu bolso.
Ele voltou para sua casa em Bolsão em 22 de junho, no seu qüinquagésimo segundo
aniversário (R.C. 1342), e nada de muito notável aconteceu no Condado até que o Sr.
Bolseiro começou os preparativos para a comemoração de seu centésimo décimo primeiro
aniversário (R.C. 1401). Nesse ponto esta História começa.
NOTA SOBRE OS REGISTROS DO CONDADO
No final da Terceira Era, o papel desempenhado pelos hobbits nos grandes eventos que
levaram à inclusão do Condado no Reino Reunido despertou neles um interesse
muito mais amplo por sua própria história, e muitas de suas tradições, até então na sua
maioria orais, foram coletadas e escritas. As famílias maiores também estavam
interessadas pelos eventos no Reinado em geral, e muitos de seus membros estudavam suas
histórias e lendas antigas. No final do primeiro século da Quarta Era já
se podiam encontrar no Condado várias bibliotecas com muitos livros e registros
históricos.
#15
As maiores dessas coleções ficavam provavelmente em Sob-as-torres, em Grandes
Smials, e na Sede do Brandevin. Este relato sobre o final da Terceira Era é retirado
principalmente do Livro Vermelho do Marco Ocidental. Esta fonte importantíssima para a
história da Guerra do Anel era chamada assim porque foi preservada por muito
tempo em Sob-as-torres, o lar dos Lindofilhos, Administradores do Marco Ocidental.
Originalmente, este livro era o diário pessoal de Bilbo, levado por ele a Valfenda.
Frodo o trouxe de volta para o Condado, juntamente com muitas folhas soltas de anotações
e durante R.C. 1420-1 ele quase encheu todas as paginas com seu
relato sobre
a Guerra. Mas anexados a este e preservados juntamente com ele, provavelmente num único
estojo vermelho, estavam os três grandes volumes, encapados com couro vermelho,
que Bilbo lhe deu como um presente de despedida. A esses quatro volumes foi acrescentado
no Marco Ocidental um quinto contendo comentários, genealogias e vários
outros materiais relacionados aos membros hobbits da Sociedade.
O Livro Vermelho original não foi preservado, mas muitas cópias foram feitas,
especialmente do primeiro volume, para o uso dos descendentes dos filhos de Mestre
Samwise. A cópia mais importante, entretanto, tem uma história diferente. Foi guardada em
Grandes
Smials, mas escrita em Gondor, provavelmente a pedido do bisneto
de Peregrin, e terminada em R.C. 1592 (Q.E. 172). Seu escriba acrescentou esta nota:
Findegil, Escriba do Rei, terminou este trabalho em IV 172. Ele
é uma copia exata em todos os detalhes do Livro
do Thain de Minas Tirith. Esse livro era uma cópia, feita a pedido do Rei Elessar, do
Livro Vermelho dos Periannath, e foi trazido a ele pelo Thain Peregrin quando
este se retirou para Gondor em IV 64.
O Livro do Thain foi, desse modo, a primeira cópia do Livro Vermelho, e continha muitos
dados que foram omitidos ou perdidos. Em Minas Tirith ele recebeu muitas

anotações e muitas correções, especialmente nos nomes, palavras e citações das línguas
élficas; e foi acrescentada uma versão abreviada daquelas partes do Conto
de Aragom e A rwen, que ficam de fora do relato da Guerra. Afirma-se que o conto completo
foi escrito por Barahir, neto do Intendente Faramir, algum tempo depois
da morte do Rei. Mas a característica mais importante da cópia de Findegil é que somente
ela contém todas as "Traduções do Élfico" feitas por Bilbo. Esses três volumes
foram considerados um trabalho de grande habilidade e erudição durante o qual, entre 1403
e 1418, ele usou todas as fontes disponíveis em Valfenda, tanto vivas quanto
escritas. Mas como elas foram pouco usadas por Frodo, por se tratar quase que
inteiramente dos Dias Antigos, não serão mais comentadas aqui.

#16
Sendo que Meriadoc e Peregrin se tornaram os chefes de suas grandes famílias, e ao mesmo
tempo mantiveram suas relações com Rohan e Gondor, as bibliotecas de Buqueburgo
e Tuqueburgo continham muitas coisas que não apareciam no Livro Vermelho. Na Sede do
Brandevin havia muitas obras que tratavam de Eriador e da história de Rohan.
Algumas delas foram escritas ou iniciadas pelo próprio Meriadoc, embora no Condado ele
fosse lembrado principalmente pelo seu Registro das Ervas do Condado, e pelo
seu Registro dos Anos, no qual ele discutia a relação entre os calendários do Condado e
de Bri com os de Valfenda, Gondor e Rohan. Ele também escreveu um pequeno
tratado sobre Palavras e Nomes Antigos em Rohan, mostrando um interesse especial em
descobrir o parentesco entre a língua dos Robirrim e certas "palavras do Condado"
como mathom e partículas antigas e nomes de lugares.
Em Grandes Smials os livros eram de menor interesse para o povo do Condado, embora fossem
da maior importância para a história mais abrangente. Nenhum deles foi
escrito por Peregrin, mas ele e seus sucessores coletaram muitos manuscritos feitos por
escribas de Gondor: em sua maioria cópias ou resumos de histórias ou lendas
relacionadas com Elendil e seus herdeiros. Apenas aqui no Condado era possível encontrar
materiais abundantes para a história de Númenor e a ascensão de Sauron.
Foi provavelmente em Grandes SmiaIs que O Conto dos Anos foi organizado, com a ajuda do
material coletado por Meriadoc. Embora as datas fornecidas sejam freqüentemente
conjecturais, principalmente para a Segunda Era, elas merecem atenção. É provável que
Meriadoc tenha obtido ajuda e informações em Valfenda, lugar que visitou mais
de uma vez. Ali, embora Elrond tivesse partido, seus filhos permaneceram durante muito
tempo, juntamente com alguns elementos do povo dos Altos-elfos. Afirma-se
que Celeborn tinha ido morar lá depois da partida de Galadriel, mas não há registros do
dia em que ele finalmente se dirigiu aos Portos Cinzentos, e com ele partiu
a última memória viva dos Dias Antigos da Terra-média.

CAPíTULO 1
UMA FESTA MUITO ESPERADA

Quando o Sr. Bilbo Bolseíro de BoIsào anunciou que em breve celebraria seu onzentésimo
primeiro aniversário com uma festa de especial grandeza, houve muito comentário
e agitação na Vila dos Hobbits.
Bilbo era muito rico e muito peculiar, e tinha sido a atração do Condado por sessenta
anos, desde seu notável desaparecimento e inesperado retorno. As riquezas trazidas
de suas viagens tinham agora se transformado numa lenda local, e popularmente se
acreditava que a Colina em Bolsão estava cheia de túneis recheados com tesouros.
E se isso não fosse o suficiente para se ter fama, havia também seu vigor prolongado que
maravilhava as pessoas.
O tempo passava, mas parecia ter pouco efeito sobre
o Sr. Bolseiro. Aos noventa anos, parecia ter cínqüenta. Aos noventa e nove, começaram a
chamá-lo de bem-conservado; mas inalterado ficaria mais próximo da realidade.
Havia pessoas que balançavam a cabeça e pensavam que isso era bom demais; parecia injusto
que qualquer pessoa possuísse (aparentemente) ajuventude perpétua, além
de (supostamente) uma riqueza inexaurível.
- Isso terá seu preço - diziam eles. - Não é natural e trará problemas.
Mas até agora os problemas não haviam chegado, e como o Sr. Bolseiro era generoso com seu
dinheiro, a maioria das pessoas estava disposta a perdoar suas esquisitices
e sua boa sorte. Continuou se relacionando em termos de cortesia com sua família (com
exceção, é claro, dos Sacola-bolseiros), e tinha muitos admiradores devotados
entre os hobbits de famílias pobres e sem importância. Mas não tinha amigos íntimos, até
que seus primos mais
jovens começaram a crescer.
O mais velho deles, e favorito de Bilbo, era o jovem Frodo Bolseiro. Quando Bilbo
tinha noventa e nove anos, adotou Frodo como seu herdeiro, e o trouxe para viver
em Bolsão, e os Sacola-bolseiros finalmente perderam as esperanças. Por acaso, Bilbo e
Frodo faziam aniversário no mesmo dia, 22 de setembro.
- Seria melhor que você viesse morar aqui, Frodo, meu rapaz!
- disse Bilbo um dia -, e então poderemos comemorar nossos aniversários juntos e
com mais conforto. Nessa época Frodo ainda estava na vintolescência, que é como
os hobbits chamavam os anos irresponsáveis entre a infância e a maioridade aos trinta e
três anos.
Mais doze anos se passaram. Todo ano os Bolseiros davam animadas festas duplas de
aniversário em Bolsão; mas agora se entendia que alguma
#22

coisa muito excepcional estava sendo planejada para aquele outono,
Bilbo ia fazer onzenta e um anos, 111, um número bastante curioso, e uma
idade muito respeitável
para um hobbit (mesmo o Velho Túk só havia chegado a
130); e Frodo ia fazer trinta e três, 33, um número importante:
o ano
em que se tornaria um adulto.
As línguas começaram a se agitar na Vila dos Hobbits e em Beirágua, rumores do

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
evento que se aproximava viajaram Por todo o Condado. A história e a personalidade
do Sr. Bilbo Bolseiro se tornaram novamente o assunto principal das conversas,
e as pessoas mais velhas repentinamente encontraram grande receptividade para suas
lembranças.
Ninguém tinha uma platéia mais atenta que o velho Ham Gamgi, geralmente
conhecido como Feitor. Ele contava histórias no Ramo de Hera, uma pequena hospedaria na
estrada
de Beirágua, e falava com certa autoridade, pois tinha cuidado do jardim de
Bolsão por quarenta anos, e tinha ajudado o velho Holman no
mesmo serviço antes disso. Agora que ele estava ficando velho e com as juntas
endurecidas, o serviço era feito principalmente por seu filho
Gamgí. Tanto pai quanto filho tinham relações muito boas com Bilbo e Frodo.
Moravam na própria Colina, no número 3 da r do Bolsinho, logo abaixo de Bolsão.
- O Sr. Bilbo é um hobbit muito cavalheiro e gentil, como eu sempre disse declarava o Feitor. E dizia a mais perfeita verdade: Bilbo era gentil com ele, chamando-o
de Mestre Hamfast, e constantemente o consultando sobre o cultivo de legumes - em
se tratando de "raizes", especialmente batatas, o Feitor era considerado por todos
na vizinhança (inclusive ele próprio) a autoridade mais importante.
- Mas e esse Frodo que mora com ele? - perguntou o Velho Noques Beirágua. O seu nome é Bolseiro, mas ele tem muito dos Brandebuque pelo que dizem. Eu não entendo
o motivo pelo qual um Bolseiro da Vila de Hobbits vai procurar uma esposa lá na
Terra dos Buques, onde as pessoas são tão estranhas.
- Não é de admirar que sejam estranhas - acrescentava Papai Dois (o vizinho de
lado do Feitor) -, pois eles moram do lado errado do Grandevin e bem perto da
Floresta Velha. Aquele é um lugar escuro e ruim,se metade das histórias for verdade.
- Você está certo, Pal - disse o Feitor, - Não é que os Brandebuques Terra dos
Buques morem na Floresta Velha; mas eles são uma raça estranha, ao que parece. Vivem
para cima e para baixo de barco naquele rio grande - e isso não é natural. Não é
de espantar que surjam problemas.
Mas, Seja como for, o Sr. Frodoé um jovem hobbit tão gentil quanto se poderia
desejar, Exatamente como o Sr. Bolseiro. Afinal de contas, seu pai era um
Bolseiro. Um
hobbit decente e respeitável, o Sr. Drogo Bolseiro, nunca houve o que dizer dele,
até que morreu afogado.
#23
-Afogado? - disseram várias vozes. Já tinham ouvido este e outros rumores mais
sombrios antes, é claro; mas os hobbits têm uma paixão por histórias familiares e estavam
prontos para ouvir esta de novo.
- Bem, é o que dizem - disse o Feítor. - Veja você: o Sr, Drogo se casou com
a pobre Sra, Prímula Brandebuque. Ela era prima em primeiro grau do nosso Sr, Bilbo
por parte de mãe (a mãe dela era a filha mais jovem do Velho Túk); e o Sr. Drogo era
primo dele em segundo grau. Desse modo, o Sr. Frodo é filho dos primos do Sr.
Bilbo em primeiro e segundo grau, e seu primo com o intervalo de uma geração,
você me entende? E o Sr. Drogo morava na Sede do Brandevin com o sogro, o velho Mestre
Gorbadoc, como sempre fez depois de seu casamento (tinha um fraco por comida e o
Velho Gorbadoc mantinha uma mesa bastante generosa); e saíram para andar de barco
no rio Brandevin, e ele e sua esposa morreram afogados; e o pobre Sr. Frodo era
apenas uma criança na época.
ouvi dizer que eles foram para a água depois do jantar e sob o luar disse o Velho Noques
-; e que foi o peso de Drogo que afundou o barco.
- E eu ouvi que ela o empurrou, e ele a puxou para dentro da água depois que ele tinha
caído - disse Ruivão, o moleiro da Vila dos Hobbits.
- Você não deveria dar ouvidos a tudo o que falam, Ruivão - disse o Feitor, que não
gostava muito do moleiro. - Não tem sentido ficar falando sobre empurrar e puxar.
Os barcos são muito traiçoeiros até para aqueles que se sentam quietinhos sem procurar
problemas. De qualquer jeito: foi assim que o Sr. Frodo se tornou um órfão

e ficou perdido, como se pode dizer, em meio àquele estranho povo da Terra dos Buques e
foi criado na Sede do Brandevin. Aquilo geralmente já é um formigueiro de
tão cheio. O velho Mestre Gorbadoe nunca teve menos do que duzentos parentes nas
redondezas.
O Sr, Bilbo não poderia ter feito coisa melhor do que trazer o menino
para morar entre gente decente.
- Mas acho que esse foi um golpe duro para aqueles Sacola-bolseiros. Eles acharam
que iam ficar com Bolsão na época em que ele foi embora e foi considerado morto.
E então ele volta e os manda sair, e continua vivendo e vivendo, e nem parecendo um dia
mais velho, puxa vida! E de repente arranja um herdeiro, e arruma toda a
documentação necessária. Os Sacolabolseiros nunca vão entrar em Bolsão depois disso, ou
pelo menos se espera que não,
- Tem um monte de dinheiro enfiado lá dentro, ouvi dizer - disse um estranho,
um visitante que estava a negócios vindo de Grã Cava, na Quarta Oeste.
- Todo o topo de vossa colina está cheio de túneis recheados de baús de Ouro e prata, e
jóias, pelo que ouvi dizer.
- Então você ouviu mais do que eu posso discutir - respondeu o Feitor. -Não sei de nada
sobrejóias.
O Sr, Bilbo não faz muita economia com seu
#24
dinheiro, e parece que não há falta dele; mas não sei nada sobre túneis. Vi o Sr. Bilbo
quando voltou, mais ou menos sessenta anos atrás, quando eu era um menino.
Não fazia muito tempo que eu era um aprendiz do velho Holman (ele era primo do meu pai),
mas mesmo assim me pediu que fosse a Bolsão para ajudá-lo a evitar que as
pessoas pisoteassem a grama e ficassem andando pelo jardim quando a toca estava à venda.
E em meio a tudo isso o Sr. Bilbo vem subindo a colina com um pônei, alguns
sacos bem grandes e uns baús. Não duvido que estivessem em sua maioria cheios de tesouros
que ele apanhou em lugares distantes, onde há montanhas de ouro, dizem
por aí; mas não havia o bastante para encher túneis. Mas o meu menino Sam deve
saber mais sobre isso. Ele vive entrando e saindo de Bolsão. É louco por histórias
de antigamente, isso ele é, e escuta todas as histórias do Sr. Bilbo. O Sr. Bilbo
ensinou-lhe suas letras - sem querer causar maldade, veja bem, e espero que nenhuma
maldade venha disso.
- Elfos e Dragões!, digo eu pra ele. Repolho com batatas é melhor para você epara mim.
Não vá se misturar com os negócios que não são para o seu bico, ou você vai
arranjar problemas muito grandes para você, digo eu pra ele. E posso dizer para outros acrescentou ele, olhando para o estranho e para o moleiro.
Mas o Feitor não convenceu sua platéia. A lenda sobre a riqueza de Bilbo estava fixada de
maneira muito firme nas mentes das gerações mais jovens de hobbits.
- Ah! mas ele pode muito bem terjuntado mais ao que trouxe no inicio
- argumentou o moleiro, representando a opinião geral. - Ele está sempre longe de
casa. E reparem nas pessoas bizarras que vêm visitá-lo: anões que chegam à noite,
e aquele velho mágico andarilho, Gandalf, e todo o resto. Você pode dizer o que quiser,
Feitor, mas Bolsão é um lugar estranho, e as pessoas de lá são mais estranhas
ainda.
- Você pode dizer o que quiser sobre coisas que não conhece melhor do que a história do
barco, senhor Ruivão - retorquiu o Feitor, apreciando ainda menos o moleiro
do que de costume. - Se isso é ser estranho, então poderíamos ter mais estranheza por
aqui. Tem gente não muito longe daqui que não ofereceria uma caneca de cerveja
a um amigo, nem se vivesse numa toca com paredes de ouro. Mas em Bolsão eles fazem as
coisas direito.
O nosso Sam disse que todo mundo vai ser convidado para a festa,
e vai haver presentes, vejam bem, presentes para todos - neste mesmo mês.
Aquele mesmo mês era setembro, e estava agradável como se poderia desejar. Um ou dois
dias depois se espalhou um rumor (provavelmente começado pelo informado Sam)

de que iria haver fogos de artificio - fogos de artificio, além do mais, como não se via
no Condado há mais de um século; na verdade, desde que o Velho Túk havia
morrido.
#25
os dias se passaram e O Dia se aproximava. Uma carroça de aparência estranha, carregada
de pacotes de aparência estranha, rodou numa noite até a Vila dos Hobbits
e foi subindo a Colina até chegar a Bolsão. Os hobbits assustados espiavam de portas
iluminadas com lamparinas para ver, embasbacados. Era conduzida por pessoas
bizarras, que cantavam canções estranhas: anões com barbas longas e capuzes fundos.
Alguns deles ficaram em Bolsão. No final da segunda semana de setembro uma charrete
passou por Beirágua vinda da Ponte do Brandevin em plena luz do dia. Um homem a conduzia,
sozinho. Usava um chapéu azul, alto e pontudo, uma longa capa cinza e um
cachecol prateado. Tinha uma longa barba branca e sobrancelhas densas que sobressaíam da
borda de seu chapéu. Crianças hobbit seguiram a charrete pelas ruas da Vila
dos Hobbits e colina acima. Era um carregamento de fogos de artificio, como eles muito
bem adivinharam. Na porta da frente de Bilbo, o homem começou a descarregar:
havia grandes pacotes de fogos de artificio de todos os tipos e formatos, cada
um rotulado com um G grande e vermelho ZZf e com a runa élfica,
RJ( Nota da corretora: Gravura de uma runa) de uma runa
Essa era a marca de Gandalf, é claro, e o velho era Gandalf, o Mago, cuja fama no
Condado se devia principalmente ao seu talento com fogos, fumaça e luzes.
Seu oficio
real era muito mais dificil e perigoso, mas o pessoal do Condado não sabia nada sobre
isso. Para eles, ele era apenas uma
das atrações" da Festa. Por isso a excitação
das crianças hobbit. "G de Grande", gritavam elas, e o velho sorria. Conheciam-no de
vista, embora ele aparecesse na Vila dos Hobbits de vez em quando e nunca ficasse
por muito tempo. Mas nem eles, nem os mais velhos dentre os velhos tinham visto uma de
suas exibições de fogos de artificio - elas agora pertenciam a um passado
lendário.
Quando o velho, ajudado por Bilbo e alguns anões, terminou de descarregar, Bilbo
distribuiu uns trocados; mas não houve nem um buscapé ou bombinha, para a decepção
dos observadores.
Saiam agora! - disse Gandalf. - Vocês vão ver bastante quando a hora chegar. - Depois
desapareceu para dentro com Bilbo, e a porta foi fechada. Os jovens hobbits
ficaram olhando em vão para a porta por um tempo, e então foram embora, sentindo que o
dia da festa nunca chegaria.
Dentro de Bolsão, Bilbo e Gandalf estavam sentados perto da janela aberta de uma pequena
sala que dava para o oeste, sobre o jardim.
O fim de tarde estava claro
e quieto. As flores brilhavam, vermelhas e douradas: bocas-de-leão e girassóis e
nastúrcios que subiam pelas paredes verdes e espiavam pelas janelas redondas.
- Como o seujardim está bonito! - disse Gandalf.
- É - disse Bilbo. - Eu gosto muito dele, e de todo o velho e querido Condado,
mas acho que preciso de férias.
#26

- Quer dizer então que você pretende continuar com seu plano?
- Pretendo. Tomei a decisão há alguns meses, e não mudei de idéia.
- Muito bem. É melhor não dizer mais nada. Continue com seu plano
- seu plano completo, veja bem - e espero que tudo saia da melhor maneira possível, para
você e para todos nós.

- Espero que sim. De qualquer forma, quero me divertir na quinta-feira, e fazer minha
brincadeirinha.
- Me pergunto quem vai rir... - disse Gandalf, balançando a cabeça.
- Veremos - disse Bilbo.
No dia seguinte, charretes e mais charretes subiram a Colina. Pode ter havido alguma
reclamação sobre "negócios locais", mas nessa mesma semana Bolsão começou a
desovar encomendas de todo tipo de provisão, mercadoria ou artigo de luxo que se pudesse
conseguir na Vila dos Hobbits ou em Beirágua, ou em qualquer outro lugar
nas redondezas. As pessoas ficaram entusiasmadas e começaram a marcar os dias no
calendário, e vigiavam o carteiro com ansiedade, esperando convites.
Em breve os convites começaram a se espalhar, e o correio da Vila dos Hobbits ficou
entupido, e choveram cartas no correio de Beirágua, e carteiros auxiliares voluntários
foram requisitados. Em fluxo constante subiam a Colina, carregando centenas de variações
polidas de Agradeço o convite e confirmo minha presença.
Um aviso apareceu no portão de Bolsão: É PROIBIDA A ENTRADA DE PESSOAS QUE NÃO VENHAM
TRATAR DOS PREPARATIVOS DA FESTA. Mesmo a entrada daqueles que estavam, ou
fingiam estar, tratando dos preparativos da festa era raramente permitida. Bilbo estava
ocupado: escrevendo convites, checando respostas, embrulhando presentes e
fazendo alguns preparativos particulares. Desde a chegada de Gandalf ele havia sumido de
vista.
Um dia de manhã os hobbits acordaram e viram o grande campo, ao sul da porta de frente de
Bilbo, cheio de cordas e paus para barracas e pavilhões. Uma entrada especial
foi aberta na ladeira que levava até a estrada, e degraus largos e um grande portão
branco foram construidos ali. As três famílias hobbit da rua do Bolsinho, vizinha
ao campo, ficaram extremamente interessadas e em geral sentiram inveja.
O velho Feitor Gamgi até parou de fingir que trabalhava em seu jardim.
As barracas começaram a ser levantadas. Havia um pavilhão especialmente grande, tão
grande que a árvore que crescia no campo cabia direitinho dentro dele, e se erguia
altaneira próxima a um canto, na cabeceira da mesa principal. Lanternas foram penduradas
em todos os seus galhos. Mais promissor ainda (para as mentes dos hobbits):
uma enorme cozinha a céu aberto foi construída no canto norte do campo. Um batalhão de
cozinheiros, de todas as
#27
hospedarias e restaurantes num raio de milhas, chegou para ajudar os anões e outras
pessoas estranhas que estavam aquarteladas em Bolsão. A agitação chegou ao máximo.
Então o céu ficou cheio de nuvens. Foi na quarta-feira, véspera da Festa. A ansiedade era
grande. A quinta-feira, 22 de setembro, finalmente chegou. o sol se levantou,
as nuvens desapareceram, bandeiras foram desfraldadas e a diversão começou.
Bilbo Bolseiro chamava aquilo defesta, mas na verdade era uma variedade de
entretenimentos reunidos num só. Praticamente todos os que moravam ali por perto foram
convidados. Muito poucos foram esquecidos por acidente, mas, como vieram de qualquer
jeito, não se importaram. Muitas pessoas de outras partes do Condado também
foram convidadas; e houve até algumas que vieram de regiões fora dos limites. Bilbo
recebeu em pessoa os convidados (e agregados) no novo portão branco. Distribuiu
presentes para todos e mais alguns - estes eram aqueles que saíam por uma porta lateral e
entravam de novo pelo portão. Os hobbits dão presentes para outras pessoas
em seus aniversários. Em geral não muito caros, e não tão generosos como nesta ocasião;
mas esse sistema não era ruim. Na verdade, na Vila dos Hobbits e em Beirágua
quase todos os dias alguém fazia aniversário, de modo que todos os hobbits tinham uma
grande chance de ganhar no mínimo um presente, pelo menos uma vez por semana.
Mas nunca se cansavam de presentes.
Nessa ocasião, os presentes foram inusitadamente bons. As crianças hobbit estavam tão
excitadas que por um tempo quase se esqueceram de comer. Havia brinquedos que
eles nunca tinham visto antes, todos lindos e alguns obviamente mágicos. Muitos deles, na
verdade, encomendados um ano antes, tinham percorrido todo o caminho vindo
da Montanha e de Valle, e eram produtos genuínos feitos por anões.

Quando todos os convidados tinham recebido as boas-vindas e estavam finalmente do lado de
dentro, houve canções, danças, música, jogos e, é claro, comida e bebida.
Houve três refeições oficiais: almoço, chá e jantar (ou ceia). Mas o almoço e o chá foram
marcados pelo fato de que nesses momentos todos estavam sentados e comendo
juntos. Em outros momentos havia simplesmente montes de pessoas comendo e bebendo continuamente, das onze até as seis e meia, quando os fogos de artifício começaram.
Os fogos eram de Gandalf.- não foram apenas trazidos por ele, mas projetados e fabricados
por ele; e os efeitos especiais, cenários e foguetes era ele quem controlava.
Mas também houve farta distribuição de buscapés, bombinhas, fósforos coloridos, tochas,
velas-de-anões, fontes-élficas, fogosde-orcs e rojões. Era tudo soberbo.
A arte de Gandalf havia se aperfeiçoado com o passar dos anos.
Havia foguetes imitando o vôo de pássaros cintilantes cantando com vozes doces. Havia
árvores verdes com troncos de fumaça escura: suas
#28

folhas se abriam como uma primavera inteira que florescesse num segundo, e seus ramos
brilhantes derrubavam flores de luz sobre os hobbits atônitos, desaparecendo
com um cheiro doce um pouco antes que pudessem tocar seus rostos voltados para o céu.
Havia montes de borboletas que voavam por entre as árvores; havia pilares de
fogos coloridos que subiam e se transformavam em águias, em caravelas, ou numa falange de
cisnes voadores; havia uma tempestade vermelha e uma chuva de gotas amarelas;
houve uma floresta de lanças de prata que surgiram repentinamente no céu com um grito
como um exército em batalha, e caíram no Água com um chiado como uma centena
de cobras incandescentes. E houve também uma última surpresa em homenagem a Bilbo, que
assustou os hobbits além da conta, como era a intenção de Gandalf As luzes
se apagaram. Uma grande fumaça subiu. Tomou a forma de uma montanha vista à distância, e
começou a brilhar no topo. Soltava chamas verdes e vermelhas. Lá de dentro
saiu um dragão de um vermelho dourado - não do tamanho de um dragão real, mas
terrivelmente parecido com um dragão real: saía fogo de suas mandíbulas e os olhos
penetrantes olhavam para baixo; houve um rugido, e por três vezes ele zuniu sobre as
cabeças da multidão. Todos se inclinaram e muitos caíram de cara no chão.
O dragão passou como um trem expresso, virou uma cambalhota, e explodiu sobre Beirágua
com um estrondo ensurdecedor.
Este é o sinal para a ceia! - disse Bilbo. O sofrimento e o medo desapareceram
imediatamente, e os hobbits prostrados se levantaram num segundo. Havia uma ceia
esplêndida
para todos; para todos, quer dizer, com a exceção daqueles convidados para o jantar
especial em família. Este aconteceu no grande pavilhão onde estava a árvore.
Os convites foram limitados a doze dúzias (um número também chamado de uma Grosa, embora
a palavra fosse considerada inadequada para se referir a pessoas); e os
convidados foram selecionados de todas as famílias com as quais Bilbo e Frodo tinham
parentesco, havendo mais uns poucos amigos que não eram parentes (como
Gandalf).
Muitos hobbits jovens foram incluídos, e estavam presentes com a permissão dos pais; pois
os hobbits eram liberais com suas crianças em se tratando de ficar acordado
até tarde, especialmente quando havia uma chance de conseguir para elas uma refeição de
graça. Criar hobbits era muito dispendioso.
Havia muitos Bolseiros e Boffins, e também muitos Túks e Brandebuques; havia vários
Fossadores (parentes da avó de Bilbo Bolseiro), e vários Roliços (relacionados
ao seu avô Tôk) e uma seleção de Covas, Bolgers, Justa-correias, Texugos, Boncorpos,
Corneteiros e Pé-soberbos. Alguns desses tinham apenas uma ligação distante
com Bilbo, e outros raramente tinham visitado a Vila dos Hobbits antes, pois moravam em
cantos remotos do Condado. Os Sacola-bolseiros não foram esquecidos. Otho
e sua esposa Lobelia

estavam presentes. Não gostavam de Bilbo e detestavam Frodo, mas o convite era tão
magnífico, escrito em tinta dourada, que eles acharam impossível recusar.
Além disso, Bilbo, seu primo, viera se especializando em comida por muitos anos, e sua
mesa gozava de alta reputação.
Todos os cento e quarenta e quatro convidados esperavam por um banquete agradável,
embora estivessem com um certo medo do discurso pos-ceia de seu anfitrião (um
quesito inevitável). Era provável que ele inoportunamente começasse a recitar trechos do
que chamava de poesia e quem sabe, depois de um ou dois copos, pudesse aludir
às absurdas aventuras de sua misteriosa viagem. Os hóspedes não ficaram decepcionados:
tiveram um banquete muito agradável, na verdade um entretenimento interessante:
lauto, abundante, variado e prolongado. As compras de provisões caíram quase a zero em
todo o distrito nas semanas seguintes; mas como as provisões de Bilbo exauriram
os estoques das lojas, adegas e armazéns num raio de várias milhas, isso não teve muita
importância.
Depois do banquete (mais ou menos) veio o Discurso. A maioria dos convidados estava,
entretanto, numa disposição tolerante, e naquele estágio delicioso que eles
chamavam de "encher os cantos". Estavam bebendo suas bebidas favoritas, e mordiscando
suas iguarias preferidas, e seus receios foram esquecidos. Estavam preparados
para ouvir qualquer coisa, e aplaudir a cada ponto final.
Queridos convidados, começou Bilbo, levantando de sua cadeira. "Escutem! Escutem!
Escutem!" - gritaram eles, e continuaram repetindo isso em
coro, parecendo relutantes
em seguir seu proprio conselho. Bilbo saiu de seu lugar e subiu numa cadeira perto da
árvore iluminada. A luz das lanternas caía-lhe sobre o rosto radiante; os botões
dourados brilhavam sobre o colete bordado. Todos podiam vê-lo em pé, acenando uma mão no
ar, e com a outra no bolso da calça.
Meus queridos Bolseiros e Boffins começou de novo; e meus queridos Tüks e Brandebuques
e Fossadores e Roliços e Covas e Corneteiros e Bolgers, Justa-correias, Boncorpos,
Texugos e Pé-soberbos.
-Pé-soberbos! " gritou um hobbit velho do fundo do pavilhão. O seu nome, é claro, era
Pé-soberbo. E merecido: seus pés eram grandes, excepcionalmente peludos, e
ambos estavam sobre a mesa.
Pé-soberbos, repetiu Bilbo. E também meus bons Sacola-bolseiros, a quem finalmente dou
boas-vindas novamente em Bolsão. Hoje é meu centésimo décimo primeiro aniversário.hoje chego aos onzenta e um! "Viva! Viva! Que essa data se repita por muitos anos!" gritaram todos, e bateram nas mesas alegremente. Isso era o tipo de coisa de
que eles gostavam. Curto e óbvio.
Espero que estejam se divertindo tanto quanto eu. Aplausos ensurdecedores. Gritos de Sim
(e Não). Ruídos de trombetas e cornetas, apitos e
#30
flautas. Havia, como foi dito, muitos hobbits jovens presentes. Centenas de estojos
musicais tinham sido distribuídos. A maioria deles levava a marca VALLE; o que
não agradava à maioria dos hobbits, mas todos eles concordavam que eram maravilhosos.
Continham instrumentos, pequenos, mas de fabricação perfeita e de tons encantadores.
Na verdade, em um canto alguns dos Túks e Brandebuques jovens, supondo que o Tio Bilbo
tivesse terminado (uma vez que já tinha dito tudo o que era necessário), agora
improvisavam uma orquestra, e começavam a tocar uma toada alegre e dançante. Mestre
Everard Túk e a Srta. Melilot Brandebuque subiram numa mesa e com sinos nas mãos
começaram a dançar a Ciranda do Pulo: uma dança bonita, mas bastante vigorosa.
Mas Bilbo não tinha terminado. Pegando uma corneta de uma criança ao seu lado, soprou
forte três vezes,
O barulho silenciou. Eu não vou me demorar muito - gritou
ele. Aplausos de toda a platéia. Chamei todos vocês por um Motivo. Alguma coisa no jeito
como ele disse isso causou uma certa impressão. Fez-se quase silêncio, e
um ou dois Túks aguçaram os ouvidos.

Na verdade, por Três Motivos! Primeiramente, para dizer a vocês que gosto imensamente de
todos, e que onzenta e um anos é um tempo curto demais para viver entre
hobbitY tão excelentes e admiráveis. Tremenda explosão de aprovação.
Eu não conheço metade de vocês como gostaria; e gosto de menos da metade de vocês a
metade do que vocês merecem. Isso foi inesperado e muito dificil. Houve alguns
aplausos esparsos, mas a maioria deles estava tentando descobrir se aquilo era um elogio.
Em segundo lugar. para comemorar meu aniversário. Aplausos novamente. Devo dizer NOSSO
aniversário. Pois hoje, é claro, é o aniversário de meu herdeiro e sobrinho
Frodo. Ele se torna maior de idade e passa a ter acesso à herança hoje. Alguns aplausos
perfunctórios dos mais velhos, e alguns gritos de "Frodo! Frodo! Felizardo!"
dos mais novos. Os Sacola-bolseíros franziram a testa e se perguntaram o que ele queria
dizer com "ter acesso à herança".
Juntos perfazemos cento e quarenta e quatro anos. O número dos convidadosfoi escolhido
para combinar com esse total notável.- Uma Grosa. se me permitem usar a expressão.
Nenhum aplauso. Aquilo era ridículo. Muitos dos convidados, especialmente os Sacolabolseiros, sentiram-se insultados, entendendo que tinham sido convidados apenas
para completar o número necessário, como mercadorias num pacote. "Uma Grosa! Que
expressão vulgar!"
Hoje também é, se me permitem que me refira à história antiga, o aniversário de minha
chegada de barril a Esgaroth, no Lago Comprido, embora o fato de ser
meu aniversário
tenha escapado de minha memória na ocasião. Eu tinha apenas cinqüenta e um anos naquele
tempo, e os aniversários
#31
não pareciam tão importantes. O banquete foi esplêndido, entretanto, embora eu
estivesse com umaforte gripe, posso me lembrar e pudesse apenas dizer "buito
obrigado".
Agora eu repito afrase mais corretamente: Muito obrigado por virem à minhafestinha.
Silêncio obstinado. Todos sentiram que alguma canção ou poesia era iminente;
e eles estavam ficando enfarados. Por que não parava de falar e os deixava beber à sua
saúde? Mas Bílbo não cantou nem recitou. Ele parou por um momento.
Em terceiro lugar efinalmente, disse ele, querofazer um COMUNICADO. Disse esta palavra
tão alto e de repente que todo mundo se sentou ereto na cadeira (os que ainda
conseguiam). Sinto informá-los de que - embora, como eu disse, onzenta e um anos seja
muito pouco tempo para passar ao lado de vocés - o FIM chegou. Estou indo embora.
JÁ. ADEUS!
Desceu da cadeira e desapareceu. Houve um clarão de luz de cegar os olhos e todos os
convidados piscaram. Quando abriram os olhos, Bilbo não estava em lugar algum.
Cento e quarenta e quatro hobbits pasmos se encostaram nas cadeiras sem dizer nada.
O velho Odo Pé-soberbo retirou seus pés da mesa e pisou com força no chão. Então
caíram num silêncio mortal até que, depois de vários suspiros, todos os Bolseiros,
Boffins, Túks, Brandebuques, Fossadores, Roliços, Covas, Bolgers, Justa-correias,
Texugos, Boncorpos, Corneteiros e Pé-soberbos começaram a falar ao mesmo tempo.
A opinião geral era de que a brincadeira tinha sido de muito mau gosto, e foi necessário
trazer mais comida e bebida para curar os convidados do choque e do desconforto.
"Sempre disse que ele era louco" foi provavelmente o comentário mais comum. Mesmo os Túks
(com umas poucas exceções) acharam o comportamento de Bilbo absurdo. Naquele
momento a maioria deles ficou achando que o seu desaparecimento não passava de mais uma
traquinagem ridícula,
Mas o velho Rory Brandebuque não tinha certeza. Nem a idade nem aquele enorme jantar
tinham
anublado suas faculdades mentais, e ele disse à sua nora Esmeralda: Tem algo suspeito aí, querida! Acho que o louco do Bolseiro partiu novamente. Velho bobo.
Mas por que nos preocuparmos? Ele não levou as provisões com ele. - E gritou
para Frodo mandar mais uma rodada de vinho.

Frodo era o único presente que não dizia nada. Por um tempo ficou sentado em silêncio ao
lado da cadeira vazia de Bilbo e ignorou todos os comentários e perguntas.
Tinha gostado da brincadeira, é claro, mesmo já estando a par de tudo. Teve dificuldades
para segurar o riso diante da surpresa indignada dos convidados. Mas ao
mesmo tempo sentia-se numa encrenca: percebeu de repente que adorava o velho hobbit. A
maioria dos convidados continuou comendo e bebendo e discutindo as esquisitices de Bilbo
#32
Bolseiro, passadas e atuais; mas os Sacola-bolseiros já tinham ido embora furiosos. Frodo
não queria mais ficar na festa. Deu ordens para que mais vinho fosse servido;
então se levantou e esvaziou seu próprio copo em silêncio à saúde de Bilbo e se esgueirou
para fora do pavilhão.
Quanto a Bilbo Bolseiro, mesmo durante o discurso ficara tateando o anel de ouro em seu
bolso: o anel mágico que guardara em segredo por tantos anos. Conforme desceu
da cadeira, colocou o anel no dedo e nunca mais foi visto por nenhum hobbit na Vila dos
Hobbits novamente.
Foi rapidamente de volta para sua toca e ficou por um momento ouvindo com um sorriso os
rumores no pavilhão e os sons de pessoas se divertindo em outras partes do
campo. Depois entrou em casa. Tirou a roupa de festa, dobrou e embrulhou em papel crepom
seu colete de seda bordado e o guardou. Aí vestiu rapidamente uns trajes
velhos e desalinhados, e apertou em volta da cintura um velho cinto de couro. Nele
pendurou uma pequena espada que estava numa bainha de couro preta e gasta. De
uma gaveta trancada, cheirando a naftalina, retirou uma velha capa e um capuz. Eles
tinham sido guardados ali como se fossem muito preciosos, mas estavam tão remendados
e manchados que mal se podia adivinhar a cor original: provavelmente verde-escuro. Eram
grandes demais para ele. Então Bilbo entrou no escritório e de uma grande
caixa-forte tirou um fardo embrulhado em panos velhos e um manuscrito com capa de couro;
e também um envelope bastante volumoso.
O livro e o fardo ele colocou em
um saco pesado que estava ali, já quase cheio. No envelope colocou o anel de ouro, e sua
fina corrente, e então o selou e endereçou a Frodo. Primeiro colocou-o sobre
a lareira, mas de repente retirou-o dali e o enfiou no bolso. Naquele momento a porta se
abriu e
Gandalf entrou depressa.
- Alô! - disse Bilbo. - Estava pensando se você ia aparecer.
- Fico feliz em encontrá-lo visível - respondeu o mago, sentando-se numa cadeira. Queria pegar você aqui ainda e falar umas últimas coisas. Suponho que você esteja
sentindo que tudo saiu de modo esplêndido e de acordo com seus planos...
- Sim - disse Bilbo. - Embora o clarão tenha sido uma surpresa: se eu fiquei assustado,
imagine os outros. Um acréscimo seu, suponho.
- Foi. Você guardou sabiamente o anel em segredo todos esses anos, e me pareceu
necessário dar aos seus convidados alguma coisa a mais que parecesse explicar o
seu súbito desaparecimento.
- E você quase estragou minha brincadeira. Você é um velho intrometido! - disse Bilbo
rindo. - Mas acho que você é mais esperto, como sempre.
- Eu sou, quando sei das coisas. Mas não tenho muita certeza sobre
essa história toda. Chegamos ao ponto final. Você fez sua brincadeira, e
#33
alarmou e ofendeu a maioria de seus parentes, e deu ao Condado assunto para mais nove
anos, ou mais noventa
é nove, e mais provavel. Você vai continuar?
- Vou. Sinto que preciso de umas férias, bem longas, como já disse antes. Provavelmente
férias permanentes: não tenho expectativas de voltar. Na verdade, não quero
voltar, e já fiz todos os preparativos. Estou velho, Gandalf Não parece, mas estou
começando a sentir isso no fundo de meu coração. Bem conservado, ora bolas! Os direitos sobre essa obra são protegidos pelas leis internacionais de Copyright. Não pode ser vendido, imprimido nem

bufou ele. - Estou me sentindo todo fino, como se estivesse esticado, se você sabe do que
estou falando: como manteiga que foi espalhada num pedaço muito grande
de pão. Isso não pode estar certo. Preciso de uma mudança, ou coisa assim.
Gandalf fitou-o de perto, curioso. - Não, não parece certo - disse ele sensatamente. Não, afinal de contas acho que seu plano é provavelmente o melhor.
- Bem, de qualquer modo eu já me decidi. Quero ver montanhas de novo, Gandalf montanhas; e depois encontrar algum lugar onde possa descansar. Em paz e silêncio,
sem um monte de parentes se intrometendo e uma fila de malditos visitantes na porta.
Preciso encontrar um lugar onde possa terminar meu livro. Pensei num bom final
para ele: e ele viveu feliz parasempre.
Gandalf riu. - Espero que ele viva. Mas ninguém vai ler o livro, não importa como seja o
final.
Olhe, eles podem ler, nos anos futuros. Frodo já leu um pedaço, até onde eu escrevi. Você
vai ficar de olho em Frodo, não vai?
- Vou!, com os dois olhos, sempre que eu puder.
- É claro que ele viria comigo se eu pedisse. Na verdade se ofereceu uma vez, um pouco
antes da festa. Mas não quer realmente, ainda. Eu quero ver o campo selvagem
antes de morrer, e as Montanhas; mas ele ainda está apaixonado pelo Condado, com
florestas e campos e pequenos rios.
Sente-se confortável aqui. Estou deixando tudo
para ele, é claro, com a exceção de algumas bagatelas. Espero que seja feliz, quando
estiver acostumado a viver sozinho. Já é tempo de ele ser dono do próprio nariz.
- Tudo? - perguntou Gandalf - O anel também? Você concordou com isso, lembra?
- Bem, sim, acho que sim - gaguejou Bilbo.
- Onde está ele?
- Num envelope, se quer saber - disse Bilbo impacientemente. - Ali na lareira. Não! Aqui
no meu bolso. - Ele hesitou. - Não é estranho isso, agora? - disse calmamente
para si mesmo. - Afinal de contas, por que não? Por que ele não deveria ficar ali?
Gandalf olhou mais uma vez atentamente para Bilbo, e havia um brilho em seus olhos. - Eu
acho, Bilbo - disse ele baixinho -, que você deveria deixá-lo para trás.
Você não quer?
#34
- Bem, quero - e não quero. Agora que chegou a hora, não gosto nem um pouco da idéia de
me separar dele. E não vejo por que deveria. Por que você quer que eu faça
isso? - perguntou ele, e a sua voz se alterou de um modo estranho. Estava carregada de
suspeita e contrariedade. - Você vive me chantageando com meu anel, mas nunca
me importunou com as outras coisas que consegui na minha viagem.
- Não, mas eu tinha que chantagear você - disse Gandalf. - Eu queria a verdade. Era
importante. Anéis mágicos são... bem, são mágicos; e são raros e curiosos. Eu
estava profissionalmente interessado no seu anel, pode-se dizer, e ainda estou. Quero
saber onde ele está, se você for embora por aí de novo. Também acho que você
o teve por tempo suficiente. Você não vai mais precisar dele, Bilbo, a não ser que eu
esteja muito enganado.
Bilbo ficou vermelho, e havia um brilho furioso em seu olhar. A expressão amigável se fez
tensa. - Por que não? - gritou ele. - E que negócio é esse de você saber
o que eu faço com minhas próprias coisas? O anel é meu. Eu o achei. Ele veio até mim.
- Sim, sim - disse Gandalf - Mas você não precisa ficar furioso.
- Se estou furioso, a culpa é sua - disse Bilbo. - Ele é meu, estou dizendo. Meu. Meu
precioso. Sim, meu precioso.
O rosto do mago permaneceu grave e atento, e apenas uma faísca nos olhos profundos
demonstrou que ele estava assustado e na verdade alarmado. - Ele já foi chamado
assim antes - disse ele. - Mas não por você.
- Mas eu estou dizendo isso agora. E por que não? Até mesmo Gollum disse a mesma coisa
uma vez. Agora o anel não é dele, é meu. E devo dizer que vou ficar com ele.
Gandalf se levantou. Falou de modo ríspido. - Você vai ser um tolo se fizer isso, Bilbo disse ele. - Você torna isso claro a cada palavra que diz.

O anel se apoderou de você e isso foi longe demais. Largue dele! E então você poderá ir
também, e ser livre.
- Eu vou fazer como quiser e irei como desejar - disse Bilbo obstinadamente.
- Agora, meu querido hobbit! - disse Gandalf. - Por toda sua longa existência nós fomos
amigos, e você me deve alguma coisa. Vamos lá! Faça como prometeu: desista
dele!
- Bem, se você quer o anel para você, diga logo! - gritou Bilbo. - Mas você não vai têlo. Eu não vou dar o meu precioso para ninguém. - Sua mão buscou o punho da
pequena espada.
Os olhos de Gandalf brilharam. - Logo será a minha vez de ficar furioso - disse ele. - Se
você disser isso de novo, eu fico. Aí você verá Gandalf, o Cinzento, se
revelar. - Deu uns passos em direção ao hobbit, e parecia ficar cada vez mais alto e
ameaçador; sua sombra enchia toda a sala.
#35
Bilbo recuou para a parede, resfolegando, a mão agarrada ao seu bolso. Ficaram por um
tempo olhando um para o outro, e o ar da sala zunia. Os olhos de Gandalf continuavam
em cima do hobbit. Lentamente suas mãos relaxaram e ele começou a tremer.
- Não sei o que aconteceu com você, Gandalf. - disse ele. - Você nunca foi assim antes.
O que está acontecendo? Ele é meu, não é? Eu o achei, e Gollum teria me matado
se eu não o tivesse guardado. Não sou um ladrão, não importa o que ele tenha dito.
- Eu nunca chamei você de ladrão - respondeu Gandalf - E também não sou ladrão. Não estou
tentando roubar você, mas ajudá-lo. Eu queria que você confiasse em mim
como confiava. - Ele se virou e a sombra sumiu. Ele pareceu diminuir, e voltou a ser um
velho grisalho, curvado e preocupado.
Bilbo passou a mão sobre os olhos. - Sinto muito! - disse ele. - Mas me senti tão
estranho. E apesar disso seria de certo modo um alívio não ter mais de me preocupar
com ele. Ele cresceu na minha mente nos últimos tempos. Às vezes eu sentia que ele era um
olho me vigiando. Estou sempre sentindo vontade de colocá-lo e desaparecer,
sabe... E me perguntando se ele está a salvo, e tocando nele para ter certeza. Tentei
trancá-lo, mas descobri que não podia descansar sem ele no bolso. Não sei por
quê. Parece que não consigo me decidir.
- Então, confie em mim - disse Gandalf. - Já está decidido. Vá embora e deixe-o aqui.
Deixe de possuí-lo. Dê-o a Frodo e eu tomarei conta dele.
Bilbo ficou parado por um momento, tenso e indeciso. Depois suspirou.
- Está bem - disse ele com um esforço. - Eu vou! - Então encolheu os ombros e
sorriu com certa aflição. -Afinal de contas, todo esse negócio de festa foi
por
causa disso: distribuir um monte de presentes de aniversario, e de alguma forma facilitar
as coisas para também dar o anel. No final das contas, as coisas não ficaram
mais fáceis, mas seria uma pena desperdiçar todos os meus preparativos. Estragaria a
brincadeira.
- Na verdade, destruiria o único motivo que eu via na coisa toda disse Gandalf.
- Muito bem! - disse Bilbo. - Ele vai para Frodo, com todo o resto. Ele respirou fundo. E agora devo ir, ou alguém vai me pegar. Eu disse adeus, e não agüentaria
fazer tudo de novo. -Apanhou seu saco e se dirigiu para a porta.
- Você ainda está com o anel no bolso - disse o mago.
- É mesmo! - gritou Bilbo. - E o meu testamento e todos os outros documentos também. É
melhor você pegá-lo e entregá-lo em meu lugar. Será mais seguro.
- Não, não dê o anel para mim - disse Gandalf. - Coloque-o sobre a lareira. Estará a
salvo lá até que Frodo venha. Eu esperarei por ele.
#36
Bilbo tirou o envelope, mas, no momento em que ia colocá-lo ao lado do relógio, sua mão
deu um arranco para trás e o pacote caiu no chão. Antes que Bilbo pudesse

apanhá-lo, o mago pulou e o agarrou, colocando-o em seu lugar. Um espasmo de raiva passou
de leve sobre o rosto do hobbit outra vez. De repente o espasmo deu lugar
a uma aparência de alívio, com uma risada.
- Bem, é isso - disse ele. - Agora vou indo!
Eles foram para o corredor. Bilbo escolheu sua bengala favorita e assobiou. Três anões
saíram de salas diferentes, onde tinham estado ocupados.
- Está tudo pronto? - perguntou Bilbo. - Tudo empacotado e etiquetado" Bem, então vamos!
- Ele saiu pela porta da frente.
A noite estava agradável, e o céu preto ponteado de estrelas. Ele olhou para cima,
sentindo o ar.
- Que bom! Que bom estar partindo novamente, partindo na Estrada
com os anões! É isso que eu realmente quis, por muitos anos! Adeus! - disse ele, olhando
para sua velha casa e inclinando-se para a porta. -Adeus,
Gandalf.
-Adeus por enquanto, Bilbo. Cuide-se bem! Você tem idade suficiente, e talvez também
sabedoria.
- Cuide-se! Eu não me preocupo. Não se preocupe comigo. Estou mais feliz que nunca, e
isso significa muita felicidade. Mas chegou a hora. Meus pés estão sendo impulsionados
de novo, finalmente - acrescentou; e então, numa voz baixinha, como se fosse para si
mesmo, cantou suavemente no escuro:
A Estrada em frente vai seguindo Deixando a porta onde começa.
Agora longe já vai indo,
Devo seguir, nada me impeça;
em seu encalço vão meus pés,
Até ajunçao com a grande estrada, De muitas sendas através.
Que vem depois" Não sei mais nada.
Parou por um momento, silencioso. Então, sem mais uma palavra, deu as costas às luzes e
vozes nos campos e barracas e, seguido por seus três companheiros, deu a
volta entrando no jardim e foi descendo rápido o longo caminho. Pulou a cerca-viva numa
parte onde era mais baixa e chegou às campinas, passando através da noite
como o farfalhar do vento na relva.
Gandalf ficou por um tempo olhando para ele, que sumia na noite. Adeus, meu querido
Bilbo, até nosso próximo encontro! - disse ele suavemente, e entrou na casa.
Frodo entrou logo depois, e o encontrou sentado no escuro, mergulhado em pensamentos. Ele se foi? - perguntou ele.
#37
- Sim - respondeu Gandalf - Finalmente ele se foi.
- Tomara, quero dizer, eu esperava até esta noite que tudo fosse apenas
uma brincadeira - disse Frodo. - Mas no fundo eu sabia que ele realmente queria ir.
Queria
ter entrado um pouco antes, apenas para vê-lo partir.
- Acho realmente que ele preferia escapulir despercebido no final -disse Gandalf. - Não
se preocupe muito. Ele ficará bem - agora. Ele deixou um pacote para você.
Ali está!
Frodo pegou o envelope da lareira e olhou-o, mas não o abriu.
- Nele você encontrará o testamento e todos os outros documentos, eu acho - disse o mago.
- Você é o dono de Bolsão. E também, eu acho, você vai encontrar um anel
de ouro.
- O anel! - exclamou Frodo. - Ele me deixou o anel? Gostaria de saber por quê! Mas ele
ainda pode ser útil.
- Pode ser e pode não ser - disse Gandalf - Eu não faria uso dele, se fosse você. Mas
guarde-o em segredo, e a salvo! Agora vou dormir.
Como dono de Bolsão, Frodo sentiu que era seu doloroso dever dizer adeus a todos os
convidados. Rumores sobre acontecimentos estranhos tinham agora se espalhado
em todo o campo, mas Frodo apenas dizia não há dúvidas de que tudo será esclarecido de
manhã. Por volta da meia-noite, vieram carruagens para as pessoas importantes.

Uma a uma, elas foram rolando colina abaixo, lotadas de hobbits saciados, mas muito
insatisfeitos. Vieram jardineiros, e removeram com carrinhos de mão aqueles que
tinham
inadvertidamente ficado para trás.
A noite passou lentamente. O sol nasceu. Os hobbits acordaram muito mais tarde. A manhã
passou. Pessoas vieram e começaram (por ordem de alguém) a retirar os pavilhões
e as mesas e cadeiras, e as colheres e facas e garrafas e pratos, e as lanternas, e os
arranjos de flores em caixas, e os restos de papel de bombinhas, e bolsas
e luvas e lenços esquecidos, e a comida que não tinha sido consumida (um item muito
pequeno). Então várias outras pessoas vieram (por ordem de ninguém): Bolseiros
e Boffins, e Bolgers, e Túks e outros convidados que moravam ou estavam hospedados em
lugares próximos. Por volta do meio-dia, quando até os mais bem alimentados
estavam a todo vapor novamente, havia uma grande multidão em Bolsão; não convidada, mas
não inesperada.
Frodo estava esperando no degrau, sorrindo, mas com uma aparência bastante cansada e
preocupada. Deu boas-vindas a todos os visitantes, mas não tinha muito mais
para dizer além do que já tinha dito antes. Sua resposta a todas as indagações era
simplesmente:
"O Sr. Bilbo Bolseiro foi embora; pelo que sei, para sempre." Alguns
visitantes ele convidou para entrar, pois Bilbo tinha deixado "mensagens" para eles.
#38
Dentro do corredor estava empilhada uma grande variedade de pacotes e embrulhos e
pequenas peças de mobília. Em cada item havia uma etiqueta. Havia várias etiquetas
deste tipo:
Para Adelard Túk, e SOMENTE PARA ELE, de Bilbo; em um guardachuva. Adelard tinha dado
cabo de muitos guarda-chuvas não etiquetados.
Para DORA BOLSEIRO em memória de uma LONGA correspondência,
com amor. de Bilbo; num grande cesto de lixo. Dora era a irmã de Drogo e a mulher mais
velha entre os parentes vivos de Bilbo e Frodo; tinha noventa e nove anos
e escrevera resmas de bons conselhos durante mais de meio século.
Para MILO COVAS, esperando que seja de utilidade, de BilBo; numa caneta de ouro e um
vidro de tinta. Milo nunca respondia cartas.
Para o uso de ANGÉLICA, do tio Bilbo; num espelho redondo e convexo. Ela era uma jovem
Bolseiro, e obviamente considerava seu rosto bemproporcionado.
Para a coleção de HUGOJUSTA-CORREIA, de um doador; numa estante (vazia). Hugo era ótimo
para pedir livros emprestados, e péssimo para devolvê-los.
Para LOBÉLIA SACOLA -BOLSEIRO, como um PRESENTE; num estojo de colheres de prata. Bilbo
achava que ela se apropriara de grande quantidade de suas colheres enquanto
ele estava longe, na primeira viagem. Lobélia sabia muito bem disso. Quando chegou mais
tarde naquele dia, pegou a idéia imediatamente, mas também pegou as colheres.
Essa é apenas uma pequena seleção dos
presentes. A residência de Bilbo ficara
realmente entulhada de coisas no curso de sua longa existência. Era uma tendência
das tocas de hobbits ficarem entulhadas: pela qual o costume de distribuir tantos
presentes de aniversário foi grandemente responsável. Não que, é claro, os presentes
de aniversários fossem sempre novos; havia um ou outro velho mathom de utilidade
esquecida que tinha circulado por todo o distrito; mas Bilbo geralmente dava presentes
novos, e guardava os que recebia. A velha toca estava sendo agora um pouco desentulhada.
Cada um dos vários presentes de despedida tinha uma etiqueta, escrita pessoalmente por
Bilbo, e muitos tinham alguma finalidade especial ou alguma brincadeira. Mas
é claro que a maioria das coisas foi dada para pessoas que as desejavam e as receberiam
bem. Os hobbits mais pobres, e especialmente aqueles da Rua do Bolsinho,
se saíram muito bem. O velho Feitor Gamgi ficou com dois sacos de batatas, uma pá nova,
um colete de lã e uma garrafa de ungüento para asjuntas enferrujadas.
O
velho Rory Brandebuque, em recompensa por sua grande hospitalidade, ficou com uma dúzia
de garrafas de Velhos Vinhedos: um vinho tinto forte que vinha da Quarta
Sul, e agora já maduro, pois tinha sido guardado pelo pai de Bilbo. Rory

desculpou Bilbo, e depois da primeira garrafa jurou que ele era um bom camarada.
Uma grande quantidade de tudo ficou para Frodo. E, é claro, todos os tesouros mais
importantes, bem como os livros, quadros, e mobília mais que suficiente. Tudo
isso foi deixado para ele. Não houve, entretanto, qualquer sinal ou menção a dinheiro ou
jóias: nem um trocado ou uma conta de vidro foram doados.
Frodo teve uma tarde bastante penosa. Um falso rumor de que todos os pertences da casa
estavam sendo distribuídos gratuitamente se espalhou como fogo selvagem, e
logo o lugar estava atulhado de pessoas que não tinham nada a fazer lá, mas que não
podiam ser impedidas de entrar. As etiquetas se rasgaram e foram misturadas,
e surgiram brigas. Algumas pessoas tentaram permutas e negociatas no corredor; e outros
tentaram fugir com itens menores que não eram destinados a eles, ou com qualquer
outra coisa que aparentemente ninguém quisesse ou protegesse. A estrada que dava para o
portão ficou lotada de carrinhos de mão e carriolas.
No meio da confusão chegaram os Sacola-bolseiros. Frodo tinha se recolhido por uns
momentos e havia deixado seu amigo Merry Brandebuque de olho nas coisas. Quando
Otho pediu para ver Frodo, Merry se inclinou educadaniente,
- Ele está indisposto - disse ele. - Está descansando.
- Você quer dizer escondido - disse Lobélia. - De qualquer modo queremos vê-lo. Vá agora
e diga isso a ele!
Merry os deixou esperando longamente no corredor, e eles tiveram tempo para descobrir seu
presente de despedida, que era o conjunto de colheres. Isto não melhorou
os ânimos. Finalmente foram conduzidos até o escritório. Frodo estava sentado à mesa com
um monte de papéis em sua frente. Parecia indisposto - pelo menos para encontrar-se
com os Sacolabolseiros - e se levantou, bulindo com alguma coisa que estava em seu bolso.
Mas conversou com eles de modo educado.
Os Sacola-bolseiros foram bastante agressivos. Começaram oferecendo preços de barganha
(como se fosse entre amigos) por várias coisas valiosas e sem etiquetas. Quando
Frodo respondeu que apenas as coisas especialmente endereçadas por Bilbo estavam sendo
doadas, disseram que tudo era suspeito.
- Somente uma coisa está clara para mim - disse Otho. - Que você está se saindo muito bem
nessa história. Insisto em ver o testamento.
Otho teria sido herdeiro de Bilbo, se não fosse pela adoção de Frodo. Ele leu o
testamento com muito cuidado e bufou. Estava tudo, infelizmente, muito claro e correto
(de acordo com os costumes legais dos hobbits que
#40
exigem, entre outras coisas, sete assinaturas de testemunhas em tinta vermelha).
- Derrotados novamente - disse ele à sua mulher. - Depois de esperar sessenta anos.
Colheres? Ninharia! - Fez um gesto de desprezo e saiu queimando o chão. Mas não
foi tão fácil se livrar de Lobélia. Um pouco mais tarde, Frodo saiu do escritório para
ver como as coisas estavam indo e ainda a encontrou por ali, investigando
cantos e frestas e dando tapas no assoalho. Ele a conduziu com firmeza até a saída,
depois de a ter livrado de vários artigos pequenos (mas bastante valiosos) que
tinham de algum modo caído dentro de seu guarda-chuva. A julgar pelo rosto, parecia que
ela estava tendo espasmos de tanto pensar numa resposta realmente contundente;
mas tudo o que conseguiu encontrar para dizer, virando-se no degrau, foi:
- Você viverá para se arrepender disso, rapaz! Por que você também não foi? Você não faz
parte deste lugar; você não é um Bolseiro - você é um Brandebuque!
Você ouviu isso, Merry? Isso foi um insulto, eu acho - disse Frodo fechando a porta na
cara dela.
- Foi um elogio - disse Merry Brandebuque. - Mas é claro que o que ela disse não é
verdade.
Depois eles deram a volta na toca e expulsaram três jovens hobbits (dois Boffins e um
Bolger) que estavam fazendo furos nas paredes de uma das adegas. Frodo também

teve uma contenda com o jovem Sancho Pé-soberbo (neto do velho Odo Pé-soberbo), que tinha
iniciado uma escavação na despensa maior, onde ele pensou ouvir um eco.
A lenda do ouro de Bilbo excitava tanto a curiosidade quanto a esperança; pois o ouro
lendário (obtido de modo misterioso, se não positivamente por meios ilícitos)
é, como todos sabem, daquele que o encontrar - a não ser que a busca seja interrompida.
Quando tinha dominado Sancho, colocando-o para fora, Frodo desabou numa cadeira no salão.
- Está na hora de fechar a loja, Merry - disse ele. Tranque a porta e não
abra para ninguém hoje, mesmo que alguém traga um aríete. - Depois foi se recompor com
uma já protelada xícara de chá.
Mal tinha se sentado quando ouviu uma batida leve na porta da frente. "Lobélia de novo,
com toda certeza", pensou ele. "Deve ter pensado em algo realmente desagradável,
e voltou para dizê-lo. Ela pode esperar."
Continuou tomando seu chá. A batida se repetiu, bem mais alto, mas ele não tomou
conhecimento. De repente a cabeça do mago apareceu na janela.
-Se não me deixar entrar, Frodo, eu arranco essa porta e jogo lá embaixo - disse
ele.
- Meu querido Gandalf! Um minutinho! - gritou Frodo, correndo até a porta. - Entre!
Entre! Pensei que fosse Lobélia.
#41
- Então eu perdôo você. Mas eu a vi agora há pouco numa charrete em direção a Beirágua,
com uma cara de azedar leite fresco.
- Ela já tinha quase me azedado. Honestamente, eu quase experimentei o anel de Bilbo.
Queria sumir.
- Não faça isso - disse Gandalf, sentando-se. - Tome cuidado com esse anel, Frodo! Na
verdade, foi em parte por isso que eu vim para dizer uma única palavra.
- Sobre o quê?
- O que você já sabe?
- Só sei o que Bilbo me disse. Ouvi a história dele: Como O encontrou e como o usou:
quero dizer, na sua viagem.
- Eu me pergunto qual história.
- Não aquela que ele contou para os anões e colocou em seu livro disse Frodo. - Ele me
contou a história verdadeira depois que eu vim morar aqui. Disse que você
o importunou até que contasse a verdade, e por isso era melhor que eu soubesse também.
"Sem segredos entre você e mim, Frodo", disse ele; "mas isso deve ficar entre
nós. O anel é meu, de qualquer forma."
Interessante! - disse Gandalf. - E o que você achou de tudo isso?
- Se você quer dizer sobre a invenção de ter ganhado um "presente", bem, achei que a
história real era muito mais provável, e não entendi o motivo da alteração.
Não é muito do feitio de Bilbo fazer isso, e eu achei muito estranho.
Eu também. Mas coisas estranhas podem acontecer com pessoas que possuem esse tipo de
tesouro - se elas o usarem. Que isso fique como um aviso para voce, para que
tome muito cuidado com ele. Esse anel pode ter mais poderes do que simplesmente fazer
você desaparecer quando desejar.
- Não entendo - disse Frodo.
- Eu também não - respondeu o mago. - Simplesmente comecei a pensar no anel,
especialmente depois da noite passada. Não é preciso se preocupar. Mas se voce seguir
meu conselho, vai usá-lo muito raramente, ou nem irá usá-lo. Pelo menos eu peço que você
não o use de qualquer maneira que possa causar comentários ou levantar suspeitas.
Digo de novo: guarde-o a salvo, e em segredo!
-Você é muito misterioso. Está com medo de quê?
- Não tenho certeza, por isso não vou dizer mais nada. Pode ser que eu tenha alguma coisa
para dizer quando voltar. Vou partir imediatamente: então é adeus por enquanto.
- Ele se levantou.
- Imediatamente?! - gritou Frodo. - Achei que você ia ficar no mínimo por mais uma
semana. Estava ansioso por sua
ajuda.

- Eu realmente queria ajudar você, mas tive de mudar meus planos. Posso ficar longe por
um bom tempo, mas volto para ver você de novo
#42
assim que puder. Quando você menos esperar, eu vou aparecer! Chegarei em silêncio. Eu não
devo mais visitar o Condado abertamente com freqüência. Acho que me tornei
muito impopular. Dizem que sou um incômodo e que perturbo a paz. Algumas pessoas estão me
acusando de realmente ter feito Bilbo desaparecer, ou coisa pior. Se você
quer saber, estão dizendo que existe um plano armado por nós dois para tomar posse da
riqueza dele.
- Algumas pessoas! - exclamou Frodo. - Você quer dizer Otho e Lobélia. Que abominável! Eu
lhes daria Bolsão e todo o resto, se pudesse ter Bilbo de volta e ir com
ele vagueando pelos campos. Eu amo o Condado. Mas de alguma forma começo a sentir que
gostaria de ter ido embora também. Fico pensando se poderei vê-lo novamente.
- Eu também - disse Gandalf - E fico pensando em muitas outras coisas. Agora adeus!
Cuide-se bem! Espere por mim, especialmente nas horas mais improváveis. Adeus.
Frodo o acompanhou até a porta. Ele acenou pela última vez e começou a andar num passo
surpreendente; mas Frodo achou que o velho mago parecia mais curvado que o
normal, quase como se estivesse carregando um grande peso. A noite estava chegando, e o
seu vulto com a capa rapidamente desapareceu no crepúsculo. Frodo não o viu
novamente por um longo tempo.

#43
CAPíTULO II
A SOMBRA DO PASSADO

O comentário não se extinguiu dentro de 9 nem de 99 dias. O segundo desaparecimento do
Sr. Bilbo Bolseiro foi discutido na Vila dos Hobbits, e na verdade em todo
o Condado, ao longo de todo o ano, sendo relembrado por muito mais tempo. Tornou-se uma
fábula para os pequenos hobbits, e finalmente o Louco Bolseiro, que costumava
desaparecer num lampejo com um estrondo e reaparecer com sacos de jóias e ouro,
\tornou-se um dos personagens lendários favoritos e sobreviveu durante muito tempo,
mesmo quando os acontecimentos reais já tinham sido esquecidos.
Mas enquanto isso a opinião geral na vizinhança era de que Bilbo, que nunca tinha sido
bom da cabeça, finalmente tinha ficado muito louco e fugido para o Azul. Ali
sem dúvida teria caído num lago ou rio e tido um trágico - mas não inesperado - final. Na
maioria das vezes a culpa era colocada em Gandalf.
"Se pelo menos aquele malfadado mago deixar o jovem Frodo em paz, talvez ele se acomode e
crie algum juizo", diziam eles. E ao que parecia o mago realmente tinha
deixado Frodo em paz, e este havia se acomodado, mas quanto a criarjuízo não se percebia
quase nada. Na verdade, ele imediatamente assumiu para si a reputação de
Bilbo, que sempre fora tido como um sujeito estranho. Recusou-se a manter o luto e no ano
seguinte deu uma festa em homenagem ao centésimo décimo segundo aniversário
de Bilbo, que chamou de Banquete do Um Um Dois. Mas esses números não correspondem à
realidade, pois vinte pessoas foram convidadas, e houve várias refeições nas
quais nevou comida e choveu bebida, como dizem os hobbits.
Alguns se chocavam bastante, mas Frodo manteve o hábito de comemorar o aniversário de
Bilbo ano após ano, até que eles se acostumaram. Dizia não considerar que Bilbo
estava morto. Quando perguntavam: "Então, onde ele está?", encolhia os ombros.
Vivia sozinho, como Bilbo havia feito, mas tinha muitos amigos, especialmente entre os
hobbits mais jovens (em sua maioria descendentes do Velho Túk) que quando
crianças apreciavam a companhia de Bilbo e viviam entrando e saindo de Bolsão. Folco
Boffin e Fredegar Bolger eram dois deles, mas seus amigos mais íntimos eram

Peregrin Túk (geralmente chamado de Pippin), e Merry Brandebuque (seu nome verdadeiro era
Meriadoc, mas isto era raramente lembrado). Frodo fazia longas caminhadas
pelo Condado com eles, mas com mais freqüência ia sozinho, e para o assombro das pessoas
#44
sensatas era visto algumas vezes longe de casa, caminhando nas colinas e bosques sob a
luz das estrelas. Merry e Pippin suspeitavam que ele às vezes visitava os
elfos, como Bilbo havia feito.
Conforme o tempo passava, as pessoas começaram a notar que Frodo também mostrava sinais
de boa "preservação": exteriormente ele conservava a aparência de um hobbit
robusto e vigoroso recém-saído da vintolescência. "A sorte vem para poucos", eles diziam;
mas foi somente quando Frodo chegou à idade geralmente mais sóbria de cinqüenta
que começaram a achar aquilo estranho.
Frodo, depois do primeiro choque, descobriu que ser dono do seu próprio nariz e o Sr.
Bolseiro de Bolsão era bastante agradável. Por alguns anos foi muito feliz
e não se preocupou demais com o futuro. Mas, sem que se desse conta disso, sentia um
arrependimento cada vez maior por não ter partido com Bilbo. Às vezes se pegava
pensando, especialmente no outono, em terras selvagens, e estranhas imagens de montanhas
que nunca havia visto apareciam em seus sonhos. Começou a dizer para si
mesmo: "Talvez eu também cruze o Rio algum dia." Ao que a outra metade de sua mente
sempre respondia: "Ainda não."
As coisas continuaram assim até Frodo chegar ao fim dos quarenta e estar próximo de seu
qüinquagésimo aniversário: cinqüenta era um número que considerava de alguma
forma significativo (ou agourento); de qualquer modo, foi com essa idade que a aventura
repentinamente sobreveio a Bilbo. Começou a se sentir inquieto, e as velhas
trilhas pareciam marcadas demais. Olhava mapas e se perguntava sobre o que estaria além
das suas bordas: a maior parte dos mapas feitos no Condado mostrava espaços
em branco além de seus limites. Pegou o costume de vagar até mais longe, na maioria das
vezes sozinho, e Merry e seus outros amigos o vigiavam com ansiedade. Freqüentemente
era visto andando e conversando com os estranhos andarilhos que tinham começado a
aparecer no Condado nessa época.
Havia rumores sobre coisas estranhas acontecendo no mundo lá fora, e como Gandalf não
tinha até aquele momento aparecido ou enviado recados já por vários anos, Frodo
recolhia todas as notícias que conseguia. Os elfos, que raramente entravam no Condado,
podiam agora ser vistos passando em direção ao Oeste através dos bosques à
noite, passando e não retornando; mas eles estavam abandonando a Terra-média e não
estavam mais preocupados com os problemas do lugar. Havia, entretanto, anões na
estrada em quantidade incomum. A velha estrada Leste-Oeste passava pelo Condado, indo
acabar nos Portos Cinzentos, e os anões sempre a tinham usado para chegar até
suas minas nas Montanhas Azuis. Eram a principal fonte de
#45
notícias de partes distantes que os hobbits possuíam - se é que desejavam qualquer
notícia: geralmente os anões diziam pouco e os hobbits perguntavam menos ainda.
Mas agora Frodo sempre encontrava anões estranhos de países distantes, procurando refúgio
no Oeste. Estavam preocupados, e alguns deles falavam aos sussurros sobre
o Inimigo e a Terra de Mordor.
Os hobbits só conheciam esse nome em lendas do passado escuro, como uma sombra no fundo
de suas memórias; mas era um nome agourento e perturbador. Parecia que o
poder maligno da Floresta das Trevas havia sido expulso pelo Conselho Branco para
reaparecer com força maior nas velhas fortalezas de Mordor. A Torre Escura tinha
sido reconstruída, dizia-se. Dali o poder estava se espalhando em todas as direções, e lá
no extremo oriente e ao sul havia guerras e o medo crescia. Os
orcs se
multiplicavam de novo nas montanhas. Os trofis estavam longe de suas terras e tinham
deixado de ser estúpidos; eram astutos e tinham armas terríveis. E havia murmúrios

sobre criaturas ainda mais horríveis que todas essas, mas que não tinham nome.
-É claro que nada disso chegou aos ouvidos dos hobbits comuns. Mas mesmo os mais surdos e
os que menos saíam de casa começaram a ouvir histórias estranhas, e aqueles
que tinham negócios nas fronteiras começaram a ver coisas esquisitas. As conversas no
Dragão Verde em Beirágua, numa noite na primavera do qüinquagésimo aniversário
de Frodo, demonstravam que mesmo no confortável coração do Condado rumores foram ouvidos,
embora a maioria dos hobbits ainda risse deles.
Sam Gamgí estava sentado em um canto perto do fogo, e à sua frente estava Ted Ruivão, o
filho do moleiro; havia também vários outros hobbits rústicos escutando sua
conversa.
- A gente anda escutando coisas estranhas ultimamente - disse Sam.
- Ah! - disse Ted. - A gente escuta se der ouvidos. Mas eu posso escutar histórias
agradáveis e contos infantis em casa, se quiser.
- Não há dúvida que sim - retorquiu Sam. - E eu digo que há mais verdade em algumas delas
do que você possa imaginar. Então, quem inventou as histórias? Veja os
dragões, por exemplo...
-Não, 'brigado - disse Ted. - Não vejo nada. Ouvi falar deles quando era rapaz, mas não
preciso acreditar nisso hoje em dia. Só existe um dragão em Beirágua, que
é o Verde - disse ele, provocando o riso geral.
- Tudo bem - disse Sam, rindo com os outros. - Mas e esses homensárvores, esses que
podemos chamar de gigantes? Dizem que um homem maior que uma árvore foi visto
indo para os Pântanos do Norte há pouco tempo.
- Quem disse isso?
#46
- Meu primo Hal é um. Ele trabalha para o Sr. Boffin em Sobremonte e sobe até a Quarta
Norte para caçar. Ele viu um.
- Disse que viu, talvez. Esse seu primo vive dizendo que viu coisas, e pode ser que ele
veja coisas que não estão lá.
- Mas esse era grande como um olmo, e estava andando - avançava sete j ardas a cada
passo, como se fosse uma polegada.
- Então aposto que não era uma polegada. O que ele viu era um olmo, é bem possível.
- Mas esse estava andando, eu te digo; e não existe olmo nos Pântanos do Norte.
- Então Hal não pode ter visto um - disse Ted. Houve risos e aplausos: a platéia parecia
achar que Ted tinha marcado um ponto.
- Mesmo assim - disse Sam -, você não pode negar que outros, além do nosso Halfast, viram
pessoas esquisitas atravessando o Condado - atravessando, imagine você:
existe mais gente que foi barrada nas fronteiras. Os Fronteiros nunca estiveram tão
ocupados. E ouvi dizer que os elfos estão indo para o Oeste. Dizem que estão
indo para os portos, muito além das Torres Brancas. - Sam acenou o braço vagamente: nem
ele nem qualquer um ali sabia a que distância ficava o Mar, além das velhas
torres para lá da fronteira Oeste do Condado. Mas existia uma velha tradição de que lá
longe ficavam os Portos Cinzentos, dos quais às vezes navios de elfos partiam,
para nunca mais voltar.
- Eles estão navegando, navegando pelo Mar. Estão indo para o Oeste e nos deixando disse Sam, meio que cantando as palavras, balançando a cabeça triste e solenemente.
Mas Ted riu.
- Bem, isso não é nenhuma novidade, se você acredita nas velhas histórias. E não consigo
ver que importância isso pode ter para mim ou para você. Deixe-os navegar!
Mas eu garanto que você não os viu navegando; nem qualquer outra pessoa do Condado.
- Bem, eu não sei - disse Sam pensativo. Ele acreditava ter visto um elfo uma vez nos
bosques, e ainda esperava ver mais deles algum dia. Dentre todas as lendas
que tinha ouvido em sua infância, esses fragmentos de contos e histórias semi-esquecidas
sobre os elfos, que os hobbits contavam, sempre o tocavam profundamente.
- Existem alguns, mesmo por essas partes - disse ele. - Tem o Sr. Bolseiro, para quem eu
trabalho. Ele me disse que estavam navegando, e ele sabe um pouco sobre

os elfos. E o velho Sr. Bilbo sabia mais: tive muitas conversas com ele quando era
garotinho.
- Nenhum dos dois regula bem - disse Ted. - Pelo menos o velho Bilbo era louco, e Frodo
está ficando. Se é daí que você recolheu suas informações, não precisa inventar
mais nada. Bem, amigos, vou para casa. À sua saúde! - Esvaziou sua caneca e saiu fazendo
barulho.
#47
Sam ficou sentado em silêncio e não falou mais. Tinha muito em que pensar. Em primeiro
lugar, havia muito trabalho a fazer no jardim de
Bolsão e o dia seguinte seria
cheio, se o tempo melhorasse. A grama estava crescendo rápido. Mas tinha outras coisas na
cabeça além da jardinagern. Depois de uns momentos suspirou, levantou-se
e saiu.
Era o começo de abril e o céu estava clareando depois de uma chuva pesada.
O sol tinha se posto e um entardecer pálido e fresco morria dentro da noite. Ele caminhou
sob as primeiras estrelas através da Vila dos Hobbits e Colina acima, assobiando doce e
pensativamente.
Foi bem nessa época que Gandalf reapareceu depois de uma longa ausência. Tinha estado
fora por três anos depois da Festa. Então fez uma visita rápida a Frodo e,
depois de ter dado uma boa olhada nele, partiu novamente. Durante um ou dois anos
consecutivos havia aparecido com bastante freqüência, chegando sem ser esperado
depois do anoitecer e indo embora sem avisar antes do nascer do sol. Não discutia seus
proprios assuntos e viagens, e parecia principalmente interessado em pequenas
notícias sobre a saúde e os afazeres de Frodo.
Depois, de repente, suas visitas cessaram. Já fazia mais de nove anos que Frodo não o via
ou tinha notícias dele, e começou a pensar que o mago nunca mais voltaria
e tinha perdido completamente o interesse por hobbits. Mas naquela noite, enquanto Sam
estava indo para casa e anoitecia, veio a já conhecida batida na janela do
escritório.
Frodo recebeu seu velho amigo com surpresa e grande prazer. Eles olharam bem um para o
outro.
- Ora, ora... - disse Gandalf -Você parece o mesmo de sempre, Frodo!
- Você também - replicou este; mas em segredo pensou que Gandalf parecia mais velho e
desgastado. Quis saber notícias suas e do mundo lá fora, e logo os dois estavam
numa conversa animada, que durou até tarde da noite.
Na manhã seguinte, depois de um desjejum tardio, o mago e Frodo estavam sentados perto da
janela do escritório. Havia um fogo forte na lareira, mas o sol estava
quente, e o vento vinha do sul. Tudo estava muito viçoso, e o verde novo da primavera
brilhava nos campos e nas pontas dos dedos das árvores.
Gandalf estava pensando numa primavera, quase 8O anos atrás, quando Bilbo saíra de Bolsão
sem levar um lenço. Seu cabelo talvez estivesse agora mais branco, e sua
barba e sobrancelhas mais longas, e seu rosto mais marcado pela preocupação e pela
sabedoria; mas os olhos brilhavam como sempre, e ele fumava e soprava anéis de
fumaça com o mesmo vigor e prazer.
#48
Agora fumava em silêncio, pois Frodo estava quieto, perdido em pensamentos. Mesmo na luz
do dia ele sentia a sombra escura das notícias trazidas por Gandalf. Finalmente
quebrou o silêncio.
- Ontem à noite você começou a dizer coisas estranhas sobre o meu anel, Gandalf - disse
ele. - E aí parou, porque disse que era melhor conversar esses assuntos de
dia. Não acha que devia terminar agora? Você diz que o Anel é perigoso, muito mais
perigoso do que eu imagino. De que maneira?
- De muitas maneiras - respondeu o mago. - Ele é muito mais poderoso do que jamais ousei
pensar no início, tão poderoso que no final poderia literalmente dominar

qualquer um da raça dos mortais que o possuísse. O Anel o possuiria.
- Em Eregion, há muito tempo, muitos anéis élficos foram feitos, anéis mágicos, como se
diz. E eram, é claro, de muitos tipos: alguns mais poderosos, outros menos.
Os anéis menos importantes foram apenas ensaios no oficio, que ainda não estava
totalmente desenvolvido, e para os ourives élficos eram insignificantes - embora
eu os considere um risco para os mortais. Mas os Grandes Anéis, os Anéis de Poder, esses
eram perigosos.
- Um mortal, Frodo, que possuir um dos Grandes Anéis não morre, mas também não se
desenvolve ou obtém mais vida; simplesmente continua, até que no final cada minuto
é puro cansaço. E se usar o Anel com freqüência para se tornar invisível, ele desaparece:
torna-se no fim invisível permanentemente, e anda no crepúsculo sob o olhar
do poder escuro que governa os Anéis. Sim, mais cedo ou mais tarde - mais tarde se essa
pessoa for forte ou tiver boa índole no início; mas nem a força e nem bons
propósitos durarão -, mais cedo ou mais tarde o poder escuro irá dominá-la.
- Que assustador! - disse Frodo. Houve outro longo silêncio. O som de Sam
Gamjig cortando a grama vinha do jardim.
- Há quanto tempo você sabe dessas coisas? - perguntou Frodo finalmente. - E o que é que
Bilbo sabia disso?
- Bilbo não sabia mais do que contou a você, tenho certeza - disse Gandalf - Certamente
não lhe passaria nada que considerasse perigoso, mesmo que eu tenha prometido
cuidar de você. Achava que o Anel era muito bonito e muito útil, e que se alguma coisa
estava errada ou esquisita, o problema era com ele. Disse que o Anel estava
crescendo em sua mente", sendo constantemente objeto de sua preocupação; mas nunca
suspeitou que a causa fosse o próprio anel. Embora tenha descoberto que a coisa
precisava de cuidado: nunca parecia ser do mesmo tamanho e peso; encolhia ou se expandia
de um modo estranho, e podia de repente escapar de um dedo em que coubesse
justo.
- É, ele me avisou disso em sua última carta - disse Frodo. - Por isso sempre o mantive
na corrente.
#49
- Muito sábio - disse Gandalf - Mas quanto à sua vida longa, Bilbo nunca a relacionou ao
anel. Considerou que os méritos eram dele mesmo, e tinha muito orgulho disso.
Mas estava ficando inquieto e impaciente. Fino e esticado, dizia. Um sinal de que o anel
estava tomando controle.
- Há quanto tempo você sabe de tudo isso? - perguntou Frodo de novo.
- Sei? - disse Gandalf - Sei de muitas coisas que apenas os Sábios sabem, Frodo. Mas se
quer dizer "sei sobre este anel", bem, ainda não sei, pode-se dizer. Há um
último teste para ser feito. Mas não duvido mais do que já suponho.
- Quando foi que comecei a supor? - continuou ele cismando, em busca da resposta em sua
memória. - Deixe-me ver - foi no ano em que o Conselho Branco expulsou o
poder escuro da Floresta das Trevas, um pouco antes da Batalha dos Cinco Exércitos,
quando Bilbo encontrou seu anel. Uma sombra cobriu meu coração, embora eu ainda
não soubesse o que temia. Sempre me perguntava como Gollurn tinha achado um Grande Anel,
pois aquele era um Grande Anel - isso ao menos estava claro desde o início.
Aí escutei a história estranha de Bilbo, de como o tinha "ganhado", e não pude acreditar
nela. Quando finalmente consegui que contasse a verdade, percebi na hora
que ele estava tentando colocar seu direito sobre o anel acima de qualquer dúvida. Muito
parecido com Gollum e seu "presente de aniversário". As mentiras eram muito
semelhantes para que eu ficasse tranqüilo. Ficou evidente que o anel tinha um poder
pernicioso que começava a repercutir sobre seu dono imediatamente. Este foi o
primeiro indício verdadeiro que tive de que não estava tudo bem. Disse a Bilbo que era
melhor não usar esse tipo de anel, mas ele se ressentiu e logo ficou furioso.
Não havia quase mais nada que eu pudesse fazer. Não poderia tomá-lo sem causar um grande
mal, e não conseguiria fazê-lo, de qualquer forma. Eu só podia observar
e esperar. Talvez pudesse ter consultado Saruman, o Branco, mas alguma coisa sempre me
impedia.

- Quem é Saruman? - perguntou Frodo. - Nunca ouvi falar nele antes.
- Talvez não - respondeu Gandalf - Ele não se preocupa, ou não se preocupava, com
hobbits. Apesar disso, é um dos grandes entre os Sábios. É o chefe da minha ordem
e o presidente do Conselho. Seu conhecimento é profundo, mas seu orgulho cresceu na mesma
proporção, e ele se ofende se alguém se intrometer. A história dos anéis
élficos, grandes ou pequenos, é da sua alçada. Estudou-a por muito tempo, procurando os
segredos perdidos de sua feitura; mas quando os Anéis foram debatidos no
Conselho, tudo o que nos revelou sobre seu estudo se mostrou contra meus receios. Então
minha dúvida adormeceu - de modo inquieto. Ainda observei e esperei.
- E tudo parecia estar bem com Bilbo. E os anos passaram. Sim, passaram, e pareciam não
afetá-lo. Ele não demonstrava sinais de
envelhecimento.
#50
A sombra cobriu meu coração novamente. Mas disse a mim mesmo: "Afinal de contas, ele vem
de
uma família de grande longevidade, por parte de mãe. Ainda há
tempo. Espere!"
- E esperei. Até aquela noite em que deixou esta casa. Ele disse e fez coisas que me
encheram de um medo que nenhuma palavra de Saruman poderia conter. Finalmente
soube que algo escuro e mortal estava em ação. Passei a maioria dos anos desde essa época
descobrindo a verdade sobre isso.
- Não havia nenhum mal permanente já feito, havia? - perguntou Frodo ansiosamente. - Ele
ficaria bem com o tempo, não ficaria? Quero dizer, ele poderia descansar
em paz?
- Sentiu-se melhor imediatamente - disse Gandalf. - Mas só existe um poder neste mundo
que sabe tudo sobre os Anéís e seus efeitos; e pelo que sei, não há nenhum
poder no mundo que saiba tudo sobre hobbits. Entre os Sábios, eu sou o único que sabe
sobre a tradição hobbit: um ramo de conhecimento obscuro, mas cheio de surpresas.
Podem ser moles como manteiga, porém às vezes duros como velhas raizes de árvores. Acho
provável que alguns possam resistir aos Anéis por muito mais tempo do que
os Sábios imaginam. Acho que não há necessidade de se preocupar com Bilbo.
- É claro que ele possuiu o anel por muitos anos, e o usou; de modo que pode demorar
muito até que a influência se acabe - até que rever o anel não represente um
perigo para ele, por exemplo. Se isso não acontecer, ele pode viver muito, bastante
feliz: apenas continuando como estava quando se separou do anel. No fim das contas,
desistiu dele por sua própria vontade: um ponto importante. Não, eu não estava mais
preocupado com Bilbo, uma vez que ele tinha se livrado da coisa. É por você que
me sinto responsável.
- Desde que Bilbo partiu, ando muito preocupado com você, e com todos esses hobbits
encantadores, absurdos e desamparados. Seria um triste golpe para o mundo se
o Poder Escuro dominasse o Condado; se todos vocês, estúpidos e alegres Bolgers,
Corneteiros, Boffins, Justa-correias e o resto, para não falar dos ridículos Bolseiros,
fossem todos escravizados.
Frodo estremeceu. - Mas por que isso deveria acontecer? - perguntou ele. - E por que ele
iria querer escravos assim?
- Para falar a verdade - replicou Gandalf -, acredito que até agora até agora, veja bem ele ignorou totalmente a existência dos hobbits. Você deve ficar agradecido.
Mas a sua segurança passou. Ele não precisa de vocês - tem muitos servidores úteis - mas
não se esquecerá de vocês novamente. E hobbits miseravelmente escravizados
seriam muito mais do agrado dele do que hobbits felizes e livres. Existem coisas assim,
como malícia e vingança.
- Vingança? - disse Frodo. - Vingança por quê? Ainda não entendo o que tudo isso tem a
ver com Bilbo, comigo e com nosso anel.

- Tem tudo a ver - disse Gandalf - Você ainda não sabe do perigo real; mas saberá. Eu não
sabia ao certo da última vez que vim aqui; mas chegou a hora de falar.
Dê-me o anel por um momento.
Frodo retirou-o do bolso das calças, onde estava preso numa corrente pendurada ao cinto.
Soltou-o e o entregou lentamente ao mago. Sentiu que estava muito pesado,
como se o anel ou o próprio Frodo estivessem relutantes em permitir que Gandalf o
tocasse.
Gandalf ergueu-o no ar. Parecia ser feito de ouro puro e maciço. - Você consegue ver
essas marcas nele? - perguntou o mago.
- Não - disse Frodo. - Não vejo nada. O anel é liso, e nunca mostra sinais de arranhões
ou de uso.
- Então olhe! - Para assombro e aflição de Frodo, o mago jogou o anel de repente bem no
meio de um canto aceso da lareira. Frodo deu um grito e estendeu a mão tentando
pegar as tenazes, mas Gandalf o segurou.
- Espere - disse ele numa voz imperativa, lançando de suas sobrancelhas eriçadas um olhar
rápido sobre Frodo.
O anel não mostrou nenhuma alteração aparente. Depois de um tempo Gandalf se levantou,
fechou as folhas dajanela e a cortina. A sala ficou escura e silenciosa, embora
o barulho das tesouras de Sam, agora mais próximo da janela, ainda chegasse abafado do
jardim. Por um
momento Gandalf ficou olhando para o fogo; depois se abaixou
e tirou o anel da lareira com as tenazes, e imediatamente o segurou. Frodo ficou
boquiaberto.
- Está frio - disse Gandalf. - Pegue-o! - Gandalf o colocou na palma da mão do outro, que
estava tremendo: parecia que o anel tinha ficado mais espesso e pesado
que nunca.
- Erga-o! - disse Gandalf. - E olhe de perto!
Fazendo isso, Frodo enxergou as linhas finas, mais finas que o mais fino traço de pena,
que corriam ao longo do anel, na parte interna e na externa: linhas de fogo
que pareciam formar as letras de uma caligrafia contínua. Brilhavam com uma luz
penetrante e contudo remota, como se emanasse de grande profundidade.
#52
- Não consigo ler as letras de fogo - disse Frodo numa voz trêmula.
- Não - disse Gandalf -, mas eu consigo. Essas letras são élfico, de
uma modalidade arcaica, mas a língua é a de Mordor, a qual não vou pronunciar aqui. Mas
isto em Língua Comum quer dizer, aproximadamente:
Um Anel para a todos governar, Um Anel para encontrá-los,
Um Anel para a todos trazer e na escuridão aprisioná-los
- São apenas duas linhas de versos conhecidos há muito tempo na tradição élfica:
Três Anéis para os Reis Elfos sob este céu,
Sete para os Senhores-Anões em seus rochosos corredores, Nove para Homens Mortais fadados
ao eterno sono,
Um para o Senhor do Escuro em seu escuro trono Na Terra de Mordor onde as Sombras se
deitam.
Um Anel para a todos governar, Um Anel para encontrá-los, Um Anel para a todos trazer e
na escuridão aprisioná-los Na Terra de Mordor onde as Sombras se deitam.
Parou, e então disse lentamente, numa voz profunda: - Este é o AnelMestre, o Um Anel para
a todos governar. Este é o Um Anel que ele perdeu há muito tempo, o que
causou um grande enfraquecimento de seu poder. Ele o deseja muito - mas não deve obtê-lo.
Frodo estava sentado em silêncio e paralisado. Parecia que o medo estava estendendo uma
mão enorme, como uma nuvem escura que nascia no Leste e avançava para envolvê-lo.
- Este anel! - gaguejou. - Como, como veio parar nas minhas mãos?
- Ah! - disse Gandalf. - Essa é uma longa história. Seu início remonta aos Anos Negros,
agora apenas lembrados pelos mestres conhecedores das tradições. Se eu tivesse
de lhe contar tudo, ficaríamos aqui sentados até o inverno chegar.

- Mas ontem à noite lhe falei sobre Sauron, o Grande, o Senhor do Escuro. Os rumores que
ouviu são verdadeiros: ele realmente ressurgiu; deixou seus domínios na
Floresta das Trevas e voltou à sua antiga fortaleza na Torre Escura de Mordor. Até vocês
hobbits já ouviram esse nome, como uma sombra rondando os limites das velhas
histórias. Sempre, depois de uma derrota e uma pausa, a Sombra toma outra forma e cresce
novamente.
- Gostaria que isso não tivesse acontecido na minha época - disse Frodo.
#53
- Eu também - disse Gandalf. - Como todos os que vivem nestes tempos. Mas a decisão não é
nossa. Tudo o que temos de decidir é o que fazer com o tempo que nos é
dado. E, Frodo, nosso tempo já está começando a ficar negro. O Inimigo está se tornando
muito forte. Seus planos ainda não estão amadurecidos, eu acho, mas estão
amadurecendo. Será muito difícil para nós. Já seria, mesmo se não fosse por esse acaso
terrível.
- Para o Inimigo falta ainda uma coisa que lhe dê força e sabedoria para derrotar todas
as resistências, quebrar todas as defesas e cobrir todas as terras com uma
segunda escuridão. Ele precisa do Um Anel.
- Os Três, os mais bonitos de todos, foram escondidos dele pelos ReisElfos, e suas mãos
nunca os tocaram ou macularam. Sete os Senhores Anões possuíam, mas ele recuperou
três, e os outros foram consumidos pelos dragões. Nove ele deu a Homens Mortais,
orgulhosos e poderosos, e desse modo os seduziu. Há muito tempo caíram sob o domínio
do Um, e se tornaram Espectros do Anel, sombras sob sua grande Sombra, seus mais
terríveis servidores. Há muito tempo. Faz muitos anos que os Nove foram levados
para
longe. Mas, quem sabe? Conforme as sombras cresçam novamente, estes também podem
retornar. Mas deixa para lá! Não devemos falar dessas coisas nem numa manhã do Condado.
- A situação agora é esta: os Nove foram reunidos por ele; os Sete também, ou então foram
destruidos. Os Três ainda estão escondidos. Mas não o preocupam mais. Precisa
apenas do Um, pois este foi feito por ele mesmo, pertence a ele, que permitiu que uma
grande parte de seu antigo poder passasse para o anel, de modo que pudesse
governar todos os outros. Se o recuperar, poderá comandar a todos novamente, onde quer
que estejam, até mesmo os Três, e tudo o que foi feito com eles não terá mais
efeito, e ele ficará mais forte que nunca.
- E este é o acaso terrível, Frodo. Ele acreditava que o Um estava desaparecido, que
havia sido destruido pelos elfos, como deveria ter acontecido. Mas agora sabe
que ele não desapareceu, que foi encontrado. Então está procurando, procurando, e todo o
seu pensamento está concentrado nisso. É sua grande esperança e nosso grande
receio
- Por que, por que não foi destruido? - gritou Frodo. - E como aconteceu ao Inimigo
perdê-lo, se era tão forte e o considerava tão precioso? Apertou o Anel em sua
mão, como seja enxergasse dedos escuros se estendendo para tentar tomá-lo.
- Foi tomado dele - disse Gandalf. - Antigamente a força de resistência dos elfos contra
ele era maior; e homens e elfos não eram tão estranhos uns aos outros. Os
homens de Ponente vieram ajudá-los. Este é um capítulo da antiga história que merece ser
recordado; naquele tempo também havia tristeza, e uma escuridão crescente,
mas houve pessoas valorosas e
#54
feitos que não foram totalmente em vão. Um dia, talvez, eu lhe conte toda a história, ou
quem sabe você a escute de alguém que a conhece melhor.
- Mas por enquanto, já que acima de tudo você precisa saber como essa coisa veio
parar em suas mãos, e isso já dá uma história bem longa, vou me limitar a essa parte.
Foi Gil-galad, Rei-Elfo, que juntamente com Elendil de Ponente derrotou Sauron, embora os
dois tenham sucumbido nessa empresa; lsildur, filho de Elendil,

cortou o Anel da mão de Sauron e tomou-o para si. Dessa forma Sauron foi subjugado e seu
espírito fugiu e ficou escondido por muitos anos, até que sua sombra tomou
forma novamente na Floresta das Trevas.
- Mas o anel foi perdido. Caiu no Grande ffio, Anduin, e sumiu. lsildur estava marchando
para o Norte ao longo da margem leste do Rio; perto dos Campos de Lis foi
assaltado pelos orcs das Montanhas, e quase todo o seu povo foi assassinado. Ele pulou
nas águas do Rio, mas o Anel escorregou de seu dedo enquanto nadava, e então
os orcs o viram e o mataram com flechas.
Gandalf parou. - E ali, nos lagos escuros dos Campos de Lis - disse ele -, o Anel sumiu
do conhecimento e das lendas; e até mesmo esta parte de sua história é conhecida
apenas por poucas pessoas, e o Conselho dos Sábios não conseguiu descobrir mais. Mas
finalmente acho que posso continuar a história.
- Muito depois, mas ainda há muito tempo, vivia nas margens do Grande Rio, na borda das
Terras Ermas, um pequeno povo de mãos ágeis e pés silenciosos. Acho que eram
semelhantes aos hobbits; parentes dos pais dos pais dos Grados, pois amavam o Rio e
sempre nadavam nele, ou faziam pequenos barcos de junco. Havia entre eles uma
família muito considerada, pois era maior e mais rica que a maioria, que era governada
pela avó, senhora austera e conhecedora da história antiga de seu povo. O
elemento mais curioso e mais ávido de conhecimento dessa família se chamava Sméagol. Ele
se interessava por raizes e origens; mergulhava em lagos fundos, fazia escavações
embaixo de árvores e plantas novas, abria túneis em colinas verdes; com o tempo, deixou
de olhar os topos das colinas, as folhas nas árvores, e as flores se abrindo
no ar: sua cabeça e olhos só se dirigiam para baixo.
- Tinha um amigo chamado Déagol, parecido com ele, de olhos mais penetrantes mas não tão
rápido ou forte. Uma vez pegaram um barco e desceram para os Campos de Lis,
onde havia grandes canteiros de íris e juncos em flor. Ali Sinéagol desceu e foi fuçar as
margens, mas Déagol ficou sentado no barco pescando. De repente um grande
peixe mordeu a isca, e antes que soubesse onde estava, ele foi arrastado para fora do
barco e dentro da água, até o fundo. Então soltou a linha, pois julgou ver
alguma coisa brilhando no leito do rio, e prendendo a respiração conseguiu apanhá-la.
#55
- Depois subiu soltando bolhas, com plantas em seu cabelo e um monte
de lama na mão, e nadou até a margem. E veja só! Quando limpou a lama, viu em sua mão um
lindo anel de ouro, que brilhava e resplandecia ao sol. Seu coração se alegrou.
Mas Sméagol tinha ficado vigiando de trás de uma árvore, e enquanto Déagol se regozijava
com o anel, Sinéagol chegou devagar por trás dele,
"Dê isso para nós, Déagol, meu querido", disse Sméagol sobre o ombro do amigo.
"Por quê?", perguntou Déagol.
"Porque é meu aniversário, meu querido, e eu quero isso", disse Sméagol. "Eu não ligo",
disse Déagol. "Eu já lhe dei um presente de aniversário, que foi mais do
que
eu podia. Eu encontrei isso, e vou ficar com ele."
"Vai mesmo, meu querido?" disse Sméagol; e segurou Déagol pela garganta e o estrangulou,
porque o ouro era tão brilhante e bonito. Depois pôs o anel em seu dedo.
- Jamais se descobriu o que tinha acontecido com Déagol; foi assassinado longe de casa, e
seu corpo foi habilmente escondido. Mas Sméagol voltou sozinho, e descobriu
que ninguém de sua família podia vê-lo quando estava usando o anel. Ficou muito
satisfeito com essa descoberta e a ocultou. Usava-a para descobrir segredos, e se
aproveitava de seus conhecimentos em feitos desonestos e maliciosos. Ficou com olhos
perspicazes e ouvidos aguçados para tudo que fosse pernicioso. O anel tinha
lhe dado poderes de acordo com sua estatura. Não é de admirar que tenha se tornado muito
impopular e que fosse evitado (quando visível) por todos os seus parentes.
Estes o chutavam, e ele mordia seus pés. Começou a roubar e a andar por aí resmungando
para si mesmo, gorgolejando. Por isso chamavam-no de GoIlum e o amaldiçoavam,

e lhe diziam para ir embora; sua avó, querendo paz, exPulsou-o da família e o pôs para
fora de sua toca.
-Vagou sozinho, chorando um pouco pela dureza do mundo, e viajou no acima, até chegar a
um riacho que descia das montanhas, seguindo esse caminho. Capturava peixes
em lagos fundos com dedos invisíveis e os comia crus. Num dia muito quente, quando se
inclinava sobre um lago, sentiu algo queimando na sua nuca, e uma luz ofuscante
que vinha da água doeu em seus olhos molhados. Surpreendeu-se com isso, pois havia quase
se esquecido da existência do sol. Então, pela última vez, olhou para cima
e o desafiou com o punho fechado.
-Mas quando abaixou os olhos, viu à sua frente, distantes, os topos das Montanhas
Sombrias, de onde vinha o riacho. E de repente pensou: "Debaixo daquelas montanhas
deve ser um lugar fresco e de muita sombra.
O sol não Poderia me olhar ali. As raizes dessas montanhas devem ser raízes de verdade;
deve haver grandes segredos enterrados lá que não foram descobertos desde
o início.
#56
- Então viajou de noite pelas montanhas, e encontrou uma pequena caverna, da qual corria
o riacho escuro; e fez o caminho rastejando, como uma larva entrando no
coração das montanhas; e sumiu de todo o conhecimento. O Anel entrou nas sombras com ele,
e nem mesmo quem o fez, quando seu poder começou a crescer novamente, pôde
saber qualquer coisa sobre o assunto.
- Gollum! - gritou Frodo. - Gollum? Quer dizer que esta é justamente a criatura-GoIlum
que Bilbo encontrou? Que asqueroso!
- Acho que esta é uma história triste - disse o mago - e que poderia ter acontecido com
outras pessoas, até mesmo com hobbits que eu conheci.
- Não posso acreditar que GoIlum tenha algum parentesco com os hobbits, por mais distante
que seja - disse Frodo acaloradamente. - Que idéia abominável!
- Mas mesmo assim verdadeira - replicou Gandalf. - De qualquer maneira, sei mais das
origens dos hobbits do que eles próprios. E até a história de Bilbo sugere o
parentesco. Havia muita coisa no fundo de suas mentes e memórias que era similar. Eles se
entenderam notavelmente bem, muito melhor do que um hobbit entenderia,
vamos dizer, um anão, ou um ore, ou mesmo um elfo. Pense nas charadas que ambos sabiam,
para dar um exemplo.
- Sim - disse Frodo. - Mas outros povos além dos hobbits propõem charadas e muitas delas
do mesmo tipo. E os hobbits não trapaceiam. Gollum queria trapacear o tempo
todo. Estava só tentando pegar Bilbo desprevenido. E vou mais além: sua maldade se
divertiu propondo um jogo que poderia acabar lhe dando uma vítima fácil, mas que
não o prejudicaria se perdesse.
- Receio que isso seja a pura verdade - disse Gandalf. - Mas havia algo mais nisso tudo,
eu acho, que você ainda não pode ver. Até mesmo Gollum não estava totalmente
arruinado. Provou ser mais resistente até do que um dos Sábios poderia imaginar - como
também pode acontecer com um hobbit. Havia um cantinho de sua mente que ainda
lhe pertencia, e a luz entrou por ele, como através de uma fenda no escuro: uma luz que
vinha do passado. Penso que na verdade deve ter sido bom para ele ouvir uma
voz agradável novamente, trazendo lembranças do vento, das árvores, e do sol na grama, e
coisas desse tipo que estavam esquecidas.
- Mas é óbvio que isso só iria fazer com que a sua parte má ficasse mais furiosa no fim a não ser que pudesse ser conquistada. A não ser que pudesse ser curada.
- Gandalf suspirou. - Infelizmente, há poucas chances. Mas ainda há esperança. Sim, pois
embora ele tivesse possuído o Anel por um período tão longo, incluindo quase
todo o espaço de que possa se lembrar, já fazia tempo que não o usava muito: na negra
escuridão era quase desnecessário. Certamente
Gollum nunca "desapareceu". Está magro e ainda

resistente. Mas a coisa estava devorando sua mente, é claro, e o tormento ja era quase
insuportável.
- Todos os "grandes segredos" sob as montanhas acabaram se transformando apenas numa
noite vazia: não havia mais nada para descobrir, nada que valesse a pena fazer,
apenas comer coisas nojentas furtivamente e remoer ressentimentos. Odiava a escuridão, e
ainda mais a luz: odiava tudo, e acima de tudo o Anel.
- O que quer dizer? - perguntou Frodo. - Certamente o Anel era o seu precioso e a única
coisa com que se preocupava. Mas se o odiava, por que não se livrou dele,
ou não foi embora e o deixou?
- Você precisa começar a entender, Frodo, depois de tudo o que ouviu disse Gandalf. - Ele
o odiava e o amava, da mesma forma como odiava e amava a si mesmo. Não
podia se livrar dele. Nessa questão, não tinha mais vontade própria.
- Um anel de poder toma conta de si próprio, Frodo. Ele pode escapar traiçoeiramente, mas
quem o possui nunca o abandona. No máximo brinca com a idéia de entregá-lo
aos cuidados de alguma outra pessoa - e isso apenas num estágio inicial, quando ele
começa a se apoderar. Mas até onde sei somente Bilbo em toda a história foi além
de brincar, e realmente o entregou. Precisou de toda a minha ajuda, também. E mesmo assim
ele nunca teria simplesmente abandonado o anel, ou colocado de lado. Não
foi Gollum, Frodo, mas o próprio anel que decidiu as coisas. O anel o
deixou.
- Ali, e bem em tempo de encontrar Bilbo? - disse Frodo. - Um ore não teria sido mais
adequado?
- Isso não é brincadeira - disse Gandalf - Não para você. Esse foi o acontecimento mais
estranho em toda a história do Anel até agora: a chegada de Bilbo exatamente
naquela hora, e o fato de ter colocado a mão sobre ele, cegamente, no escuro.
- Havia mais que um poder em ação, Frodo. O anel estava tentando voltar para seu mestre.
Tinha escorregado da mão de Isildur e o traíra; depois, quando houve uma
chance, pegou o pobre Déagol, e este foi assassinado; e depois disso Golhim, e
o Anel o devorou. Não podia mais fazer uso dele: Gollum era pequeno e mesquinho demais,
e enquanto permanecesse com ele o anel jamais deixaria o lago escuro. Então nesse
momento, quando seu mestre estava novamente acordado e enviando seu pensamento
escuro da Floresta das Trevas, ele abandonou Gollum. Para ser apanhado pela pessoa mais
improvável que se poderia imaginar: Bilbo, do
Condado.
- Por trás disso havia algo mais em ação, além de qualquer desígnio de quem fez o Anel.
Não posso dizer de modo mais direto: Bilbo estava designado a encontrar o
Anel, e não por quem o fez. Nesse caso você também estava designado a possuí-lo. E este
pode ser um pensamento encorajador.
#58
- Mas não é - disse Frodo. - Embora eu não tenha certeza de que entendi o que me contou.
Mas como você soube tudo isso sobre o Anel, e sobre Gollum? Você realmente
sabe de tudo isso, ou ainda está só adivinhando?
Gandalf olhou para Frodo, e seus olhos brilharam. - Eu sabia muito, e aprendi muito respondeu ele. - Mas não vou prestar contas de tudo o que fiz para você. A
história de Elendil e lsildur e do Um Anel é conhecida por todos os Sábios. E ficou
demonstrado, apenas pelas letras de fogo, que o seu anel é o Um, mesmo deixando
de lado outras evidências.
- E quando você descobriu isto? - perguntou Frodo, interrompendo.
- Agora há pouco, nesta sala, é claro - respondeu o mago secamente.
- Mas já esperava fazer essa descoberta. Voltei de escuras jornadas e de uma longa
procura para fazer o teste final. É a última prova e as coisas agora estão muito
claras. Descobrir a parte de Gollum, e ajustá-la à lacuna da história exigiu alguma
reflexão. Posso ter começado com suposições a respeito de Gollum, mas não estou
supondo agora. Eu sei. Eu o encontrei!
- Você encontrou Gollum? - exclamou Frodo, surpreso.
- Sim, a coisa mais óbvia a fazer, é claro, se fosse possível. Já estava tentando havia
muito tempo, mas finalmente consegui.
- Então o que aconteceu depois que Bilbo escapou dele? Você sabe?

- Não claramente. O que você ouviu foi o que Gollum estava disposto a contar - embora, é
claro, não do modo que relatei. Por exemplo, ele chamava o Anel de seu "presente
de aniversário", e não abria mão disso. Disse que veio de sua avó, que tinha montes de
coisas bonitas daquele tipo. Uma história ridícula. Não duvido de que a avó
de Sméagol fosse uma matriarca, uma grande pessoa à sua maneira, mas dizer que ela
possuía muitos Anéis-Élficos era absurdo, e quanto a doá-los, isso era mentira.
Mas uma mentira com um fundo de verdade.
- O assassinato de Déagol assombrava Gollum, e ele inventou uma defesa, repetindo-a ao
seu "precioso" muitas vezes, enquanto roia ossos no escuro, até quase acreditar
no que dizia. Era seu aniversário, Déagol devia ter-lhe dado o anel. Para ele era óbvio
que o anel tinha aparecido daquele modo porque era um presente. Era seu presente
de aniversário, e tudo o mais...
- Eu o suportei o quanto pude, mas a verdade era desesperadamente importante, e no final
precisei ser rude. Amedrontei-o com fogo e arranquei dele a verdadeira história,
pouco a pouco, junto com muito rosnar e resmungar. Considerou-se mal interpretado e
usado. Mas quando finalmente me contou a história, até o final do jogo de charadas
e a fuga de Bilbo, não disse mais nada, a não ser na forma de pistas obscuras. Alguma
outra coisa o amedrontava mais que eu. Resmungava que iria ter de volta o que
era seu. As pessoas iriam ver se ele suportaria ser chutado, expulso de uma toca e depois
roubado. Gollum tinha agora bons amigos, bons e muito fortes. Eles
59
o ajudariam. Bolseiro iria pagar por isso. Esse era seu principal pensamento. Odiava
Bilbo e amaldiçoava seu nome. E mais: sabia de onde ele tinha vindo.
- Mas como descobriu? - perguntou Frodo.
- Bem, quanto ao nome, o próprio Bilbo o disse, muito ingenuamente; e depois disso seria
fácil descobrir de onde vinha, já que Gollum tinha saído de sua ilha. Ah,
sim, ele saiu. O desejo pelo anel provou ser mais forte que seu medo dos
orcs, e até da luz. Depois de um ou dois anos ele deixou as montanhas. Veja você, embora
ainda preso ao desejo pelo anel, Gollum não estava mais sendo devorado por ele; começou a
reviver um pouco. Sentiu-se velho, terrivelmente velho, embora menos tímido,
e estava mortalmente faminto.
- A luz, do sol e da lua, ainda eram odiadas por ele, e sempre serão, eu acho; mas ele
foi esperto. Descobriu que podia se esconder da luz do dia e do luar, e fazer
seu caminho rápida e suavemente na calada da noite com seus olhos pálidos e frios, e
capturar coisas amedrontadas ou imprudentes. Ficou mais forte e corajoso com
nova comida e ar. Conseguiu achar o caminho da Floresta das Trevas, como se poderia
esperar.
- Foi ali que você o encontrou? - perguntou Frodo.
- Eu o vi lá - respondeu Gandalf - Mas antes disso ele vagara por lugares distantes,
seguindo o rastro de Bilbo. Não tenha dúvida de que foi dificil arrancar qualquer
informação dele, pois sua conversa era sempre interrompida por maldições e ameaças.
"O que ele tinha em ssseus bolssos?", dizia ele, "eu não sabia, não, precioso.
Trapaça barata. Não foi uma pergunta honesta. Ele enganou primeiro, enganou sim. Quebrou
as regras. Deveríamos ter espremido ele, sim, precioso. E nós vamos, precioso!"
- Esta é uma amostra de sua conversa. Suponho que você não queira mais. Tive de agüentar
isso por vários dias. Mas através das pistas que escapavam com aquele rosnar,
descobri que seus pés silenciosos o tinham conduzido finalmente a Esgaroth e até as ruas
de Valle, escutando secretamente e espiando. Bem, a notícia dos grandes
acontecimentos estava espalhada pelas Terras Ermas, e muitos tinham ouvido o nome de
Bilbo e sabiam de onde vinha. Nós não fizemos segredo de nossa viagem de volta
até sua casa no Oeste. Os ouvidos atentos de Gollum logo escutariam o que desejavam.
- Então, por que ele não seguiu o rastro de Bilbo por mais tempo? perguntou Frodo. - Por
que não veio até o Condado?
- Ah! - exclamou Gandalf. - Agora chegamos ao ponto. Acho que Gollum tentou. Partiu e se
dirigiu ao Oeste, até o Grande Rio. Mas aí mudou a direção. A distância
não o intimidou, disso tenho certeza. Não, alguma outra coisa o afastou. Assim pensam
meus amigos, os que o caçaram para mim.

- Os elfos da Floresta o procuraram primeiro, uma tarefa fácil para eles, pois seu rastro
ainda era recente nessa época. Seguiram-no através da Floresta das Trevas
e de volta novamente, embora não tenham conseguido capturá-lo. A Floresta estava cheia de
rumores sobre ele, contos terríveis mesmo para animais e pássaros. Os homens
da Floresta disseram que havia algo diferente e terrível, um fantasma que bebia sangue.
Subia nas árvores para procurar ninhos; se arrastava dentro de tocas para
encontrar filhotes; escorregava através das janelas para procurar berços.
- Mas na borda oeste da Floresta das Trevas o rastro mudou de rumo. Desviou para o sul,
fugiu do alcance da visão dos elfos da Floresta e foi perdido. E então cometi
um grande erro. Sim, Frodo, e não o primeiro; embora receie que possa ter sido o mais
grave. Deixei as coisas acontecerem. Deixei-o escapar, pois tinha muito em
que pensar naquela época, e ainda confiava nos estudos de Saruman.
- Bem, isso foi anos atrás. Paguei por isso com muitos dias escuros e perigosos. Já fazia
muito tempo que o rastro era antigo quando comecei a segui-lo novamente,
depois da partida de Bilbo. E minha busca teria sido em vão, se não fosse pela ajuda que
tive de um amigo: Aragorn, o maior viajante e caçador do mundo nesta era.
Juntos procuramos Gollum em toda a extensão das Terras Ermas, sem esperança e sem
sucesso. Mas finalmente, quando eu tinha desistido da busca e me voltava para outras
coisas, Gollum foi encontrado. Meu amigo retornou, depois de passar por grandes perigos,
trazendo a miserável criatura.
- O que Gollum estivera fazendo não dizia. Apenas chorava e nos chamava de cruéis, com
muitos goIltuns de sua garganta: e quando o pressionamos, lamentou-se e nos
adulou, e esfregou as longas mãos, lambendo os dedos como se doessem, como se estivesse
lembrando de alguma tortura antiga. Mas receio que não há sombra de dúvida:
ele tinha feito um percurso longo e furtivo, passo a passo, milha a milha, até finalmente
chegar à Terra de Mordor.
Um silêncio pesado caiu sobre a sala. Frodo podia ouvir as batidas de seu coração. Mesmo
lá fora tudo parecia quieto. Nenhum som da tesoura de Sam podia ser ouvido.
- Sim, a Mordor - disse Gandalf - Infelizmente, Mordor atrai todas as coisas malignas, e
o Poder Escuro estava usando todas as forças para reuni-las ali.
O Anel
do Inimigo também cumpriria seu papel, fazendo Gollum ficar atento aos chamados. E todas
as pessoas estavam na época sussurrando sobre a nova Sombra no Sul, e sobre
seu ódio pelo Oeste. Ali estavam seus novos e bons amigos, que o ajudariam em sua
vingança.
- Idiota infame! Naquela terra poderia aprender muito, demais para que pudesse continuar
tranqüilo. E mais cedo ou mais tarde, enquanto
espreitava
#61
e vigiava nas fronteiras, ele seria capturado e levado - para exame. Foi assim que
aconteceu, receio. Já tinha permanecido ali por um longo tempo quando foi encontrado,
fazendo o caminho de volta. Em alguma missão maldosa. Mas isso não importa agora. Seu
maior dano estava feito.
- Sim, infelizmente! Através dele o Inimigo ficara sabendo que o Um tinha sido encontrado
novamente. Ele sabe onde Isildur morreu. Sabe onde Gollum encontrou seu
anel. Sabe que este é um dos Grandes Anéis, pois garantiu vida longa. Sabe que não é um
dos Três Anéis, pois estes nunca foram perdidos. Sabe que não é nenhum dos
Sete ou dos Nove, pois seu paradeiro é conhecido. Sabe que este é o Um. E finalmente
ouviu falar de hobbits e do Condado.
- É provável que esteja procurando o Condado atualmente, se é que ainda não descobriu
onde fica. Na verdade, Frodo, receio até que o nome Bolseiro, que por muito
tempo passou despercebido, tenha se tornado importante para ele.

- Mas isso é terrível - gritou Frodo. - Muito pior do que o pior que eu havia imaginado a
partir de suas insinuações e advertências. ó Gandalf, meu melhor amigo,
que devo fazer? Pois agora estou realmente com medo. Que devo fazer? É uma pena que Bilbo
não tenha apunhalado aquela criatura vil, quando teve a chance!
- Pena? Foi justamente Pena que ele teve. Pena e Misericórdia: não atacar sem
necessidade. E foi bem recompensado, Frodo. Tenha certeza de que ele foi tão pouco
molestado pelo mal, e no final escapou, porque começou a possuir o Anel desse modo. Com
Pena.
- Sinto muito - disse Frodo. - Mas estou com medo; e não sinto nenhuma pena de Gollum.
- Você não o viu - Gandalf interrompeu.
- Não vi e não quero ver - disse Frodo. Não consigo entender você. Quer dizer que você e
os elfos deixaram-no viver depois de todas as coisas horríveis que fez?
Agora, de qualquer modo, ele é tão mau quanto um ore, e um inimigo. Merece a morte.
- Merece! Ouso dizer que sim. Muitos que vivem merecem a morte. E alguns que morrem
merecem viver. Você pode dar-lhes vida? Então não seja tão ávido parajulgar e
condenar alguém à morte. Pois mesmo os muito sábios não conseguem ver os dois lados. Não
tenho muita esperança de que Gollum possa se curar antes de morrer, mas
existe uma chance. E ele está ligado ao destino do Anel. Meu coração me diz que ele tem
ainda algum tipo de função a desempenhar, para o bem ou para o mal, antes
do fim; e quando a hora chegar, a pena de Bilbo pode governar o destino de muitos - e o
seu também. De qualquer forma não o matamos: está muito velho e infeliz.
Os elfos da Floresta o mantêm preso, mas o tratam com toda a gentileza que têm em seus
sábios corações.
#62
- Mesmo assim - disse Frodo. - Mesmo que Bilbo não pudesse matar Gollum, gostaria que não
tivesse ficado com o Anel. Gostaria que nunca o tivesse encontrado, e que
eu não o possuísse agora! Por que permitiu que eu ficasse com ele? Por que não me obrigou
a jogá-lo fora, ou a destruí-lo?
- Permitir? Obrigar? - disse o mago. - Você não prestou atenção em tudo o que eu disse?
Você não sabe o que está dizendo. Mas quanto a jogá-lo fora, isto seria
obviamente errado. Esses Anéis têm um modo de ser encontrados. Em mãos perversas, este
poderia ter causado um grande mal. Pior de tudo, poderia ter caído nas mãos
do Inimigo. Na verdade, certamente cairia; pois este é o Um, e ele está exercendo todo
seu poder para encontrá-lo ou atraí-lo para si.
- É claro, querido Frodo, foi perigoso para você, e isto me preocupou muito. Mas havia
tantas coisas em questão que precisei correr alguns riscos - embora não tenha
havido um só dia durante minha ausência em que o Condado não estivesse guardado por olhos
atentos. Contanto que você não o usasse, eu não achava que o Anel poderia
ter algum efeito duradouro em você; não para o mal, e de qualquer forma não por um longo
tempo. E lembre-se de que há nove anos, quando o vi pela última vez, eu
tinha certeza de muito pouca coisa.
Mas por que não destruí-lo, como você já deveria ter feito há muito tempo? - gritou
Frodo novamente. - Se tivesse me avisado, ou mesmo mandado um recado, eu o teria
destruido.
- Teria? Como faria isso? Você já tentou?
- Não. Mas acho que ele poderia ser destruido a marteladas, ou derretido.
- Tente! - disse Gandalf. - Tente agora.
Frodo retirou o Anel de seu bolso novamente e olhou para ele. Agora parecia liso e plano,
sem qualquer marca visível.
O ouro tinha uma aparência muito bela e pura,
e Frodo pensou como sua cor era bonita e rica, como era perfeitamente redondo. Era uma
coisa admirável e preciosa. Quando o tirou do bolso, pretendia atirá-lo exatamente
na parte mais quente do fogo. Mas percebia agora que não podia fazê-lo, não sem um grande
esforço. Sentiu o peso do Anel em sua mão, hesitando, e se forçando a lembrar
de tudo o que Gandalf tinha lhe contado; então, com um grande esforço de vontade fez um
movimento, como para atirá-lo longe - mas percebeu que o havia colocado de

volta no bolso.
Gandalf riu de modo severo. - Está vendo? Também você, Frodo, já não consegue se livrar
dele, ou danificá-lo. E eu não poderia "obrigar" você - a não ser usando
de força, o que quebraria sua vontade. Mas quanto a destruir o Anel, a força é inútil.
Mesmo que você o pegasse e o
martelasse
#63
com uma marreta pesada, nenhum vestígio apareceria nele. Suas mãos não podem desfazê-lo,
nem as minhas.
- Seu pequeno fogo, é claro, não derreteria nem ouro comum. Este Anel já passou por ele
incólume, e nem foi aquecido. Mas não há forja de ferreiro neste Condado
que possa alterá-lo de forma alguma. Nem mesmo as bigornas e os fornos dos anões poderiam
fazer isso. Alguém disse que o fogo dos dragões poderia derreter e consumir
os Anéis de Poder, mas hoje em dia não sobrou nenhum dragão na terra cujo velho fogo seja
quente o suficiente; nem nunca houve qualquer dragão, nem mesmo Ancalagon,
o Negro, que pudesse danificar o Um Anel, o Anel Governante, pois ele foi feito pelo
próprio Sauron.
- Só existe uma maneira: encontrar as Fendas da Perdição nas profundezas de Orodruin, a
Montanha de Fogo, e atirar o Anel ali, se você realmente quer destruí-lo,
colocá-lo fora do alcance do Inimigo para sempre.
- É claro que quero destruí-lo! - gritou Frodo. - Ou, bem.... fazer com que ele seja
destruido. Não sou talhado para buscas perigosas. Gostaria de nunca ter visto
o Anel! Por que veio a mim? Por que fui escolhido?
- Perguntas desse tipo não se podem responder - disse Gandalf. Pode ter certeza de que
não foi por méritos que outros não tenham: pelo menos não por poder ou sabedoria,
Mas você foi escolhido, e portanto deve usar toda força, coração e esperteza que tiver.
- Mas tenho tão pouco dessas coisas! Você é sábio e poderoso. Você não ficaria com o
Anel?
- Não! - gritou Gandalf, levantando-se de repente. - Com esse poder eu teria um poder
grande e terrível demais. E comigo o Anel ganharia uma força ainda maior e
mais fatal. - Seus olhos brilharam e seu rosto se acendeu como se estivesse iluminado por
dentro. - Não me tente! Pois eu não quero ficar como o próprio Senhor do
Escuro. Mas o caminho do Anel até meu coração é através da piedade, piedade pela fraqueza
e pelo desejo de ter forças para fazer o bem. Não me tente! Não ouso tomá-lo,
nem mesmo para mantê-lo a salvo, sem uso. O desejo de controlá-l o seria grande demais
para minhas forças. E vou precisar delas. Grandes perigos me esperam.
Foi até ajanela, correu a cortina e abriu as venezianas. A luz do sol afluiu para dentro
da sala novamente. Sam passou ao longo do caminho do lado de fora, assobiando.
- E agora - disse o mago, voltando-se para Frodo -, a decisão é sua! Mas sempre ajudarei
você. - Colocou a mão no ombro de Frodo. -Ajudarei você a carregar este
fardo, enquanto precisar carregá-lo. Mas precisamos fazer alguma coisa logo.
O Inimigo está se aproximando.
Houve um longo silêncio. Gandalf sentou-se novamente e tirava baforadas de seu cachimbo,
como se estivesse perdido em pensamentos. Seus
#64
olhos pareciam fechados, mas sob as pálpebras estavam vigiando Frodo atentamente. Frodo
olhou fixamente para as brasas vermelhas na lareira, até que elas encheram
toda a sua visão, e ele parecia estar olhando no interior de profundos poços de fogo.
Estava pensando nas lendárias Fendas da Perdição, e no terror da Montanha de
Fogo.
- Bem - disse Gandalf finalmente. - Em que está pensando? Já decidiu o que fazer?
- Não! - respondeu Frodo, saindo da escuridão e voltando a si, surpreso ao descobrir que
não estava escuro, e que da janela podia ver o jardim iluminado pelo sol.

- Ou, talvez, sim. Pelo que entendi do que você disse, suponho que devo manter o Anel e
guardá-lo, pelo menos por agora, não importa o que isso me acarrete.
- O que quer que aconteça, será lento, lento para o mal, se guardá-lo com esse propósito.
- Espero que sim - disse Frodo. - Mas espero que possa encontrar logo algum outro
guardião melhor. Mas por enquanto parece que represento um perigo, um perigo para
todos os que vivem perto de mim. Não posso guardar o Anel e ficar aqui. Devo deixar
Bolsão, o Condado, deixar tudo e ir embora. - Ele suspirou.
- Gostaria de salvar o Condado, se pudesse - embora tenha havido ocasiões em que pensei
não ter palavras para descrever a estupidez e idiotice dos habitantes daqui,
e senti que o bom para eles seria um terremoto ou uma invasão de dragões. Mas não sinto
assim agora. Sinto que enquanto o Condado permanecer a salvo e tranqüilo
atrás de mim, a minha andança será mais suportável: saberei que em algum lugar existe um
chão seguro, mesmo que meus pés não possam pisá-lo de novo.
- É claro que às vezes pensei em ir embora, mas imaginava isso como um tipo de férias,
uma série de aventuras como as de Bilbo ou ainda melhores, terminando em paz.
Mas isto agora significa o exílio, fugir de um perigo para cair em outro, levando o
perigo por onde quer que eu vá. E suponho que devo ir só, se estou fazendo isto
para salvar o Condado. Mas sintome muito pequeno, e extirpado de minhas raizes e - bem desesperado.
O Inimigo é tão forte e terrível!
Não disse a Gandalf, mas enquanto falava um grande desejo de seguir Bilbo queimava em seu
coração - seguir Bilbo, e talvez até encontrá-lo novamente. Um desejo tão
forte que superou o medo: quase poderia correr para fora e depois para a estrada sem seu
chapéu, como Bilbo tinha feito numa manhã parecida, há muito tempo.
- Meu querido Frodo! - exclamou Gandalf. - Os hobbits são de fato criaturas
surpreendentes, como já disse antes. Pode-se aprender tudo o que há para saber sobre
eles num mês, e apesar disso ainda podem depois de cem
#65
anos surpreendê-lo numa emergência. Mal esperava por uma resposta dessas, nem mesmo vinda
de você. Mas Bilbo não errou quando escolheu seu herdeiro, embora quase
não imaginasse a importância desse fato. Receio que esteja certo. O Anel não poderá ficar
escondido no Condado por muito mais tempo; e para o seu próprio bem, e
também dos outros, você deve ir, e deixar o nome Bolseiro para trás. Não será seguro ter
este nome, fora do Condado ou nas Terras Ermas. Agora vou dar a você um
nome de viagem. Quando partir, vá como o Sr. Monteiro.
- Mas não acho que você precise ir só. Não se conhecer alguém em quem confia, e que
esteja disposto a ir ao seu lado - e que você esteja disposto a levar a perigos
desconhecidos. Mas se procurar um companheiro, seja cuidadoso na escolha! E tenha cuidado
com o que
disser-, mesmo para os amigos mais íntimos!
O Inimigo tem muitos espiões e muitas maneiras de escutar.
De repente parou, como se estivesse ouvindo alguma coisa. Frodo percebeu que tudo estava
quieto, dentro e fora. Gandalf esgueirou-se para um dos lados da janela.
Então, num movimento brusco, pulou sobre o parapeito e esticou o braço longo para fora e
para baixo. Alguém grasnou e a cabeça encaracolada de Sam
Gamgi, pendurada
por uma orelha, apareceu na janela.
- Ora, ora, pelas minhas barbas! - disse Gandalf - Sam Gamgi, hein? Agora, o que você
pode estar fazendo aí?
-Abençoado seja, Sr. Gandalf, senhor! - disse Sam. - Nada! Nada de mais! Estava só
cortando a beira da grama embaixo da janela, se o senhor me entende. Pegou a tesoura
e a exibiu como prova.
- Não entendo - disse Gandalf, sério. - Já faz um tempo que parei de ouvir o som de sua
tesoura. Há quanto tempo você está espionando?
- Espionando, senhor? Perdão, mas não estou entendendo. Não há segredos em Bolsão, disso
eu não duvido.

- Não seja tolo! O que você ouviu, e por que ficou escutando? - Os olhos de Gandalf
flamejaram e suas sobrancelhas se eriçaram como cerdas.
- Sr. Frodo, senhor! - gritou Sam trémulo. - Não deixe que ele me
machuque, senhor! Não deixe que ele me transforme em alguma coisa apavorante. Meu velho
pai ficaria tão magoado. Eu não queria fazer mal, palavra de honra, senhor!
- Ele não vai machucar você - disse Frodo, mal podendo conter o riso, embora ele mesmo
estivesse assustado, e bastante surpreso. - Ele sabe tanto quanto eu que você
não queria fazer mal a ninguém. Mas venha até aqui e responda as suas perguntas
diretamente.
- Bem, senhor - disse Sam, tremendo um pouco ainda. - Escutei um bocado que não entendi
direito, sobre um inimigo, e anéis, e o Sr. Bilbo, senhor, e dragões, e uma
montanha de fogo, e - elfos, senhor. Escutei porque
#66
não pude me segurar, se entende o que quero dizer. Perdoe, senhor, mas adoro histórias
desse tipo. E acredito nelas também, não importa o que Ted possa dizer. Elfos,
senhor! Eu adoraria vê-los. O senhor não poderia me levar junto para ver os elfos quando
for?
De repente Gandalf riu. - Entre! - gritou ele, e colocando para fora os dois braços
levantou o atônito Sam, a tesoura e pedaços de grama cortada e tudo o mais, exatamente
através da janela, colocando-o no chão. - Levá-lo para ver os elfos, hein? - disse ele,
olhando Sam de perto, mas com um sorriso brilhando em seu rosto. - Então
você escutou que o Sr. Frodo está indo embora?
- Escutei, senhor, e é por isso que eu engasguei: e ao que parece o senhor ouviu. Tentei
não engasgar, senhor, mas aquilo explodiu dentro de mim: fiquei tão atordoado...
- Não posso evitar, Sam - disse Frodo com tristeza. De repente percebeu que fugir do
Condado implicaria despedidas muito mais dolorosas do que simplesmente dizer
adeus aos confortos conhecidos de Bolsão. Preciso ir. Mas... - e aqui olhou firme para
Sam - se realmente gosta de mim, manterá isso em segredo absoluto. Entende?
Se não fizer isso, se voce soltar uma só palavra do que escutou aqui, então quero que
Gandalf o transforme num sapo pintado e encha o jardim de cobras.
Sam caiu de joelhos, tremendo. - Levante-se, Sam - disse Gandalf Pensei em algo melhor
que isso. Algo para fechar sua boca, e puni-lo de modo exemplar por ter ficado
escutando a conversa. Você irá embora com o Sr. Frodo!
- Eu, senhor? - gritou Sam, pulando como um cachorro que é convidado para um passeio. Eu ir e ver elfos e tudo o mais? Viva! - gritou ele, rompendo em lágrimas.

CAPITULO III
TRÊS NÃO É DEMAIS

- Você deve partir sem que ninguém saiba, e logo - disse Gandalf.
Duas ou três semanas haviam passado, e nada de Frodo se aprontar para ir.
- Eu sei, mas as duas coisas são dificeis - objetou ele. - Se eu simplesmente desaparecer
como Bilbo, essa história nunca estará encerrada no Condado.
- É claro que você não deve desaparecer! - disse Gandalf - De nada adiantaria! Eu disse
logo, não instantaneamente. Se puder pensar num modo de escapar do Condado
sem que todo mundo fique sabendo, vale a pena esperar um pouco. Mas você não deve demorar
demais.
- Que tal no outono, ou depois do Nosso Aniversário? --perguntou Frodo. - Acho que
provavelmente até lá posso organizar alguma coisa.
Para falar a verdade, Frodo relutava em partir, agora que o momento

chegara. Bolsão parecia uma residência muito mais desejável do que fora por muitos anos,
e ele desejava aproveitar ao máximo o seu último verão no Condado. Sabia
que, quando o outono chegasse, pelo menos uma parte de seu coração consideraria com mais
carinho a idéia de viajar, como sempre acontecia nessa estação. Na realidade,
decidira ir em seu quinquagesimo aniversário: o centésimo vigésimo oitavo de Bilbo. Esse
parecia, de alguma forma, ser o dia adequado para partir e segui-lo. A possibilidade
de seguir Bilbo predominava em sua mente, sendo a única coisa que tornava suportável a
idéia de ir embora. Pensava o minimo possivel no Anel e a que lugares este
poderia acabar por levá-lo. Mas não revelava todos os seus pensamentos a Gandalf
O que o mago adivinhava era dificil dizer.
Gandalf olhou Frodo e sorriu.
- Muito bem - disse ele. - Acho que assim está bom - mas não pode ser nem um
pouco depois. Estou ficando muito ansioso. Enquanto isso,
cuide-se, e não dê qualquer pista do seu destino! E cuide para que Sam
Gamgi não fale nada. Se ele der com a língua nos dentes, vou realmente transformá-lo num
sapo.
- Quanto ao meu destino - disse Frodo -, seria dificil eu me trair e revelá-lo a alguém,
pois não tenho ainda uma idéia clara.
- Não seja ridículo - disse Gandalf - Não o estou prevenindo para que não deixe seu
endereço no correio! Mas você está deixando o Condado, e ninguém deve saber disso,
até que esteja bem longe. E você vai ter de ir, ou pelo menos partir, em direção ao
Norte, Sul, Leste ou Oeste - e certamente ninguém deve saber a direção.
#68
- Tenho estado tão ocupado pensando em deixar Bolsão e dizer adeus, que nunca nem cogitei
qual direção tomar - disse Frodo. - Para onde devo ir? E pelo que devo
me guiar? Qual será minha busca? Bilbo foi procurar um tesouro, lá e de volta outra vez;
mas eu vou perder um tesouro, e não voltarei, pelo que estou entendendo.
- Mas você ainda não está conseguindo enxergar muito longe - disse Gandalf - Nem eu. Sua
tarefa pode ser encontrar as Fendas da Perdição; mas essa busca pode estar
destinada a outros. Eu não sei. De qualquer modo, você ainda não está pronto para aquela
longa estrada.
- Não mesmo! - disse Frodo. - Mas enquanto isso, que caminho devo tomar?
- Em direção ao perigo; mas sem precipitação demasiada, e não direto demais - respondeu o
mago. - Se
.quer um conselho, vá para Valfenda. Essa viagem não deve
ser muito perigosa, embora a estrada esteja menos fácil do que antes, e ficará pior até o
fim do ano.
- Valfenda - disse Frodo. - Muito bom: vou para o leste, com destino a Valfenda. Levarei
Sam para visitar os elfos; ficará encantado. - Ele falava de modo suave,
mas seu coração de repente foi tomado pelo desejo de ver a casa de Elrond Semi-elfo e
respirar o ar daquele vale profundo, onde grande parte do Belo Povo ainda vivia
em paz.
Numa noite de verão, uma notícia espantosa chegou ao Ramo de Hera e ao Dragão Verde.
Gigantes e outros prodígios nas fronteiras do Condado foram esquecidos para
dar lugar a assuntos mais importantes: o Sr. Frodo estava vendendo Bolsão, na verdade já
tinha vendido - para os Sacola-bolseiros!
- E por uma boa quantia - diziam uns. - Por uma bagatela - diziam outros. - E isso é mais
provável, visto que a Sra. Lobélia é a compradora. (Otho falecera alguns
anos antes, na madura mas frustrante idade de 102 anos.)
A razão pela qual o Sr. Frodo estava vendendo sua bonita toca gerava ainda mais
discussões que o preço. Alguns tinham a teoria - apoiada pelos acenos de cabeça e
insinuações do próprio Sr. Bolseiro - de que o dinheiro de Frodo estava acabando: ele ia
deixar a Vila dos Hobbits e viver modestamente, com o que recebesse pela
venda, lá em Terra dos Buques, entre seus parentes Brandebuques. - O mais longe possível
dos Sacola-bolseiros
- alguns acrescentavam. Mas a idéia da riqueza incomensurável dos Bolseiros de Bolsão
estava tão cristalizada, que essa suposição parecia inverossímil, mais ainda

do que qualquer outra razão ou desrazão que a imaginação deles pudesse sugerir: para a
maior parte, tudo sugeria um plano obscuro e ainda oculto de Gandalf. Embora
se mantivesse quieto e não saísse à luz do dia, todos sabiam que o mago "estava escondido
em Bolsão". Mas mesmo que não se entendesse como a mudança podia se encaixar
nos desígnios de
#69
sua magia, não restava dúvida sobre um ponto: Frodo Bolseiro estava retornando para a
Terra dos Buques.
- Sim, estarei de mudança neste outono - dizia ele. - Merry Brandebuque está procurando
uma toca confortável, ou talvez uma pequena casa. Na verdade, com a ajuda
de Merry, ele já tinha escolhido e comprado
uma casinha em Cricôncavo, no campo além de Buqueburgo. Fingia para todos, com a exceção
de Sam, que pretendia ficar por lá permanentemente. A decisão de partir
em direção ao leste havia lhe sugerido isto; a Terra dos Buques ficava na fronteira leste
do Condado, e, como passara sua infância ali, seu retorno parecia no mínimo
digno de crédito.
Gandalf permaneceu no Condado por mais de dois meses. Então, numa manhã no final de
junho, logo após o plano de Frodo estar finalmente pronto, de repente anunciou
que estava partindo de novo no dia seguinte.
- Só por pouco tempo, espero - disse ele. - Mas vou descer além das fronteiras
do sul para conseguir mais notícias,
se puder. Descansei mais do que devia.
Falava de modo calmo, mas Frodo teve a impressão de que estava bastante
preocupado.
- Aconteceu alguma coisa? - perguntou ele.
- Bem, não; mas escutei umas coisas que me deixaram ansioso e precisam
ser averiguadas. Se, no fim das contas, julgar necessário que você parta com urgência,
voltarei
imediatamente, ou pelo menos mandarei um recado. Enquanto isso, continue com seu plano;
mas tenha mais cuidado do que nunca, especialmente com o Anel. Vou frisar
mais uma vez: não o use.
Partiu ao amanhecer.
- Posso voltar qualquer dia desses - disse ele. Devo estar de volta o mais
tardar para sua festa de despedida. Afinal de contas, acho que você
pode precisar da minha companhia na estrada.
No início, Frodo ficou bastante perturbado, e sempre se perguntava o que Gandalf teria
ouvido; mas a ansiedade se acalmou, e naquele clima agradável esqueceu os
problemas por uns tempos. Raramente o Condado tinha visto um verão mais bonito, ou um
outono mais pródigo: as árvores carregadas de maçãs, o mel pingando dos favos,
as espigas de trigo altas e cheias.
O outono já avançava, e Frodo não tinha voltado a se preocupar com Gandalf outra vez.
Setembro estava passando, e ainda nenhuma notícia dele.
O Aniversário, e a mudança, se aproximavam, e mesmo assim ele não veio nem enviou recado.
Bolsão começou a ficar movimentada. Alguns amigos de Frodo vieram para
ficar e ajudá-lo com a bagagem: Fredegar Bolger e Folco Boffin e, é claro, seus amigos
especiais Pippin Túk e Merry Brandebuque. Só estes quatro viraram todo o lugar
de ponta-cabeça.
Em 20 de setembro, duas carroças cobertas saíram carregadas em direção à Terra dos
Buques, levando para a casa nova, através da Ponte do Brandevin, a mobília e os
mantimentos que Frodo não tinha vendido. No dia
#70
seguinte Frodo ficou realmente ansioso, sempre esperando que Gandalf aparecesse. Quintafeira, a manhã de seu aniversário, surgiu linda e clara, exatamente como

tinha sido no aniversário de Bilbo. Gandalf ainda não aparecera. À noite Frodo deu sua
festa de despedida: bem modesta, apenas um jantar para ele e seus quatro
ajudantes; estava preocupado e não sentia ânimo para festas. Pesava-lhe o coração pensar
que em breve teria de se separar dos jovens amigos. Buscava um modo de dizer
isso a eles.
Entretanto, os quatro hobbits mais jovens estavam alegres, e a festa logo ficou bastante
animada apesar da ausência de
Gandalf. A sala de jantar estava vazia, a não
ser por uma mesa com cadeiras, mas a comida estava boa, e o vinho também: o vinho de
Frodo não fora incluído na venda para os Sacola-bolseiros.
- Não importa o que aconteça com o resto das minhas coisas, quando os
S-Bs lhes puserem as garras em cima; pelo menos encontrei um bom lugar para isto! - disse
Frodo,
enquanto esvaziava o copo. Era a última gota de Velhos Vinhedos.
Depois de muitas canções, e conversar sobre muitas coisas que tinham feito juntos,
fizeram um brinde ao aniversário de Bilbo, e então beberam à saúde dele e de Frodo
juntos, de acordo com o hábito de Bilbo. Então saíram para arejar um pouco e olhar as
estrelas, e depois foram dormir. A festa de Frodo tinha acabado, e Gandalf
não aparecera.
Na manhã seguinte ficaram ocupados carregando outra carroça com o resto da bagagem. Merry
tomou conta disso, e partiu com Fatty (isto é, Fredegar Bolger)
. - Alguém precisa estar lá e aquecer a casa antes da sua chegada - disse
Merry. - Bem, vejo vocês depois - depois de amanhã, se não dormirem no caminho.
Foleo foi para casa depois do almoço, mas Pippin ainda ficou. Frodo estava inquieto e
ansioso, tentando em vão captar algum sinal de Gandalf. Decidiu esperar até
o começo da noite. Depois disso, se Gandalf precisasse vê-lo com urgência, iria até
Cricôncavo, e poderia até chegar lá antes, pois Frodo ia a pé. Seu plano - pelo
prazer de dar uma última olhada no Condado, mais do que por qualquer outro motivo - era
caminhar da Vila dos Hobbits até a balsa de Buqueburgo, com bastante calma.
- Devo treinar um pouco também - disse ele, olhando-se num espelho empoeirado no salão
quase vazio.
Havia muito não fazia caminhadas cansativas, e achou que o reflexo
estava um tanto balofo.
Depois do almoço, para a irritação de Frodo, apareceram os Sacolabolseiros, Lobélia e o
filho ruivo, Lotho.
- Finalmente nossa! - disse Lobélia entrando na casa.
Isso não era correto, nem estritamente verdadeiro, pois a venda de Bolsão
não teria efeito antes de meia-noite. Mas pode ser que Lobélia tenha esquecido: fora
obrigada
a esperar por Bolsão cerca de
#71
setenta e sete anos mais do que imaginara a princípio, e estava agora com cem anos. De
qualquer modo, tinha vindo para se certificar de que nada do que tinha comprado
fora levado embora; e queria as chaves. Demorou muito para ficar satisfeita, pois tinha
trazido um longo inventário, do qual verificou item por item. Ao fim de tudo,
partiu com Lotho e a chave sobressalente, e com a promessa de que a outra chave ficaria
com os
Gamgis na rua do Bolsinho. Bufou e demonstrou de modo cabal que achava
os mgi capazes de saquear tudo durante a noite. Frodo não lhe ofereceu chá.
Tomou o seu com Pippin e Sam Gamgi na cozinha. Fora anunciado oficialmente que Sam ia
para a Terra dos Buques "para ajudar o Sr. Frodo e cuidar de seu pequeno jardim";
esse arranjo foi aprovado pelo Feitor, embora não o consolasse diante da perspectiva de
ter Lobélia como vizinha.
- Nossa última refeição em Bolsão! - disse Frodo, empurrando para trás sua cadeira.
Deixaram a louça para Lobélia. Pippin e Sam amarraram suas três mochilas e as
empilharam na varanda. Pippin saiu para um último passeio no jardim. Sam desapareceu.

O sol se pôs. Bolsão parecia triste, um lugar melancólico e desarrumado. Frodo andou
pelas conhecidas salas, e viu a luz do pôr-do-sol desmaiar nas paredes, e sombras
que vinham dos cantos já se insinuando. O interior da casa escureceu lentamente. Saiu e
desceu pelo caminho que conduzia até o portão de entrada, indo em seguida
por uma passagem estreita até a Estrada da Colina. Tinha uma certa esperança de ver
Gandalf subindo a passos largos em meio ao crepúsculo.
O céu estava claro e as estrelas ficavam cada vez mais brilhantes. Teremos uma noite
agradável - disse ele em voz alta. - Isso é um bom começo. Tenho vontade de
caminhar. Não agüento esperar mais. Vou partir, e Gandalf deve me seguir. - Virou-se para
voltar, e então parou, ouvindo vozes logo ali, do outro lado da esquina
da rua do Bolsinho. Uma delas certamente era do velho Feitor; a outra era estranha, e de
certo modo desagradável. Não conseguia entender o que dizia, mas ouviu as
respostas do Feitor, que tinha uma voz bem aguda. O velho parecia desconcertado.
- Não, o Sr. Bolseiro foi embora. Hoje cedo, e o meu Sam foi junto: de qualquer jeito, as
coisas dele não estão mais aí. Sim, foram vendidas e levadas, digo ao senhor.
Por quê? Isso não é da minha conta. Ele se mudou para Buqueburgo ou algum lugar por ali,
lá para as bandas de baixo. Sim o caminho é bom. Nunca fui até lá; o pessoal
da Terra dos Buques é esquisito. Não, não posso dar nenhum recado. Boa-noite para o
senhor!
Passos desceram a Colina. Frodo tentava vagamente descobrir o motivo de seu alívio quando
percebeu que os passos não tinham subido a Colina. "Acho que estou farto
de perguntas e curiosidade sobre o que faço", pensou
#72
ele. "Que bando de intrometidos!" Fez menção de ir perguntar ao Feitor quem estava
pedindo as informações; mas pensou melhor (ou pior), virou-se e andou rápido
de volta a Bolsão.
Pippin estava sentado sobre sua mochila na varanda. Sam não estava lá. Frodo entrou na
sala escura.
- Sam!
- chamou ele.
- Sam, está na hora!
- Estou indo, senhor - veio uma resposta lá de dentro, rapidamente seguida pelo
próprio Sam, que limpava a boca. Estivera dizendo adeus ao barril de cerveja
na adega.
- Todos a bordo, Sam? - disse Frodo.
- Sim, senhor. Agora posso agüentar bastante, senhor.
Frodo fechou e trancou a porta redonda, dando a chave para Sam.
- Corra até sua casa com isto, Sam! - disse ele. - Depois corte a estrada e
junte-se a nós no portão
da alameda além das campinas, o mais rápido possível. Não vamos passar pela vila esta
noite. Muitas orelhas em pé e olhos espionando.
- Sam correu a toda velocidade.
- Bem, finalmente estamos indo! - disse Frodo.
Puseram suas mochilas nos ombros e pegaram suas bengalas, dobrando a esquina em
direção ao lado oeste de Bolsão.
-Adeus! - disse Frodo, olhando para as janelas escuras e fechadas.
Acenou a mão, voltou-se e (seguindo os passos de Bilbo, sem saber) apressou-se
atrás de Peregrin, descendo
o caminho do jardim. Pularam sobre a parte baixa da cerca-viva lá embaixo e entraram nos
campos, passando pela escuridão como um farfalhar na grama.
No pé da Colina, do lado oeste, chegaram até o portão que se abria para uma alameda
estreita. Ali pararam e ajustaram as correias de suas mochilas. Imediatamente
Sam apareceu, andando rápido e respirando com dificuldade, sua pesada mochila na altura
dos ombros, e sobre a cabeça um saco sem formato definido, ao qual dava o
nome de chapéu. No escuro lembrava muito um anão.
- Tenho certeza de que me deram as coisas mais pesadas - disse Frodo.
- Tenho pena dos caramujos, que carregam suas casas nas costas.

- Consigo carregar bem mais, senhor. Minha mochila está bem leve disse Sam, resoluto e
insincero.
- Não, não consegue, Sam! - disse Pippin. - Está bom assim para ele. Não há nada nas
mochilas além
do que nos mandou colocar. Esteve indolente nos últimos
tempos, e sentirá menos o peso da mochila quando tiver perdido um pouco do seu.
- Tenha pena de um pobre e velho hobbit - riu Frodo. - Estarei fino como uma vara de
salgueiro quando chegar à Terra dos Buques, com certeza. Mas eu estava falando
besteira. Suponho que esteja levando mais que a sua parte, Sam, e vou verificar isso na
próxima vez que empacotarmos as
#73
coisas. - Pegou novamente a bengala. - Bem, todos nós gostamos de andar
no escuro - disse ele. - Então, vamos deixar algumas milhas para trás antes de dormir.
Por um breve trecho, seguiram a alameda em direção ao oeste. Depois, abandonando-a,
viraram à esquerda e entraram silenciosamente nos campos de novo. Foram em fila
indiana ao longo de cercas-vívas e das orlas dos matagais, e a noite escura caiu sobre
eles. Em suas capas escuras, ficavam invisíveis como se todos tivessem um
anel mágico. Já que eram todos hobbits, e estavam tentando ser silenciosos, não fizeram
qualquer barulho que
mesmo um hobbit pudesse ouvir. Os próprios seres selvagens
dos campos e florestas mal notaram sua passagem.
Depois de algum tempo cruzaram o Agua, a oeste da Vila dos Flobbits, por uma pinguela
estreita.
O rio ali não era mais que uma sinuosa fita negra, ladeada por amieiros
inclinados. Uma ou duas milhas à frente, atravessaram rapidamente a grande estrada que
vinha da Ponte do Brandevin; estavam agora na Terra dos Túks e, virando em
direção ao sudeste, dirigiram-se para a Terra das Colinas Verdes. Depois de começar a
subir as primeiras ladeiras, voltaram-se e viram as luzes da Vila dos Hobbits
piscando ao longe, no suave vale do Agua, que rapidamente desapareceu nas dobras da terra
escurecida, seguido por Beirágua ao lado de seu lago cinzento. Quando a
luz do último sítio já estava bem distante, espiando por entre as árvores, Frodo se virou
e acenou um adeus.
- Fico pensando se verei este vale outra vez - disse ele calmamente. Depois de andar
cerca de três horas, pararam para descansar. A noite estava clara, fresca e
estrelada, mas feixes de névoa semelhantes a fumaça estavam avançando, subindo as
encostas das colinas, vindo das correntes de água e das várzeas profundas. Bétulas
delgadas, que um leve vento balançava sobre suas cabeças, desenhavam uma rede negra
contra o céu pálido. Fizeram uma ceia bastante frugal (para hobbits), e depois
continuaram. Logo toparam com uma estrada estreita que, subindo e descendo, desaparecia
cinzenta na escuridão à frente. Era a estrada para a Vila do Bosque, para
Tronco, e para a balsa de Buqueburgo, que subia da estrada principal no Vale do Água,
descrevendo curvas nos arredores das Colinas Verdes em direção à Ponta do Bosque,
um canto selvagem da Quarta Leste.
Depois de um tempo, mergulharam num caminho que desenhava uma fenda profunda entre altas
árvores, cujas folhas secas farfalhavam na noite. Estava muito escuro. No
começo conversaram, ou cantarolaram uma melodia suave juntos, agora que estavam longe de
ouvidos curiosos. Depois continuaram a marcha em silêncio, e Pippin começou
a ficar para trás. Finalmente, quando começaram a subir uma ladeira ingreme, ele parou e
bocejou.
- Estou com tanto sono - disse ele - que logo vou cair na estrada. Vocês vão dormir em
pé? Já é quase meia-noite!
#74
- Pensei que gostasse de andar no escuro - disse Frodo. - Mas não há tanta pressa. Merry
nos espera a qualquer hora depois de amanhã. Vamos parar no próximo ponto
adequado.

- O vento está soprando do Oeste - disse Sam. - Se chegarmos ao outro lado desta colina,
encontraremos um local bem protegido e confortável, senhor. Existe um pinheiral
seco logo ali adiante, se estou bem lembrado.
- Sam conhecia bem a terra num raio de vinte milhas da Vila dos Hobbits, mas este era o
limite de sua geografia.
Bem no topo da colina encontraram o pinheiral. Deixando a estrada, entraram na escuridão
das árvores, que tinha um cheiro profundo de resina, e recolheram galhos
e pinhas secas para fazer uma fogueira. Logo tinham um alegre crepitar de chamas ao pé de
um pinheiro grande, e se sentaram em volta do fogo por um tempo, até começarem
a cochilar. Então, cada um num canto das raizes da grande árvore, enrolaram-se em
suas capas e cobertores, e logo estavam num sono pesado. Não montaram guarda;
nem Frodo receava qualquer perigo por enquanto, pois eles ainda estavam no coração do
Condado. Algumas criaturas vieram olhá-los quando o fogo tinha se apagado.
Uma raposa que passava através da floresta cuidando de seus próprios negócios parou por
vários minutos, farejando.
"Hobbits!", pensou ela. "O que vem depois? Ouvi falar sobre coisas estranhas nesta terra,
mas nunca soube de hobbits dormindo ao relento sob as árvores. Três deles!
Tem alguma coisa muito estranha por trás disso." Estava muito certa, mas nunca soube
disso.
A manhã chegou, pálida, fria e úmida. Frodo acordou primeiro, e descobriu que a raiz da
árvore tinha feito um buraco em suas costas, e seu pescoço estava duro. "Caminhar
por prazer! Por que não vim com uma condução?", pensou ele, como sempre fazia no início
de uma expedição. "E todos os meus ótimos acolchoados de pena vendidos para
os Sacola-bolseíros! Essas raízes de árvore fariam bem a eles." Espreguíçou-se.
- Acordem, hobbits! - gritou ele. - Está uma linda manhã.
- O que tem de bonito nisso? - disse Pippin, espiando com um só olho da beira de
seu cobertor. - Sam, apronte o desjejuni para as nove e meia! Já esquentou
a água
do banho?
De um salto Sam se pôs de pé, ainda com muito sono.
- Não, senhor, ainda não! - disse ele.
Frodo arrancou os cobertores de Pippin e o fez rolar no chão; depois caminhou até
a beira da floresta. Ao leste, bem distante, o sol vermelho surgia da névoa
que
pairava espessa sobre o mundo. Tingidas de dourado e vermelho, as árvores do outono
pareciam estar navegando sem raizes num mar de sombras, Um pouco abaixo dele,
à esquerda, a estrada descia íngreme por um desfiladeiro e desaparecia.
#75
Quando voltou, Sam e Pippin estavam fazendo uma boa fogueira.
Água - gritou Pippin. - Cadê a água?
- Não carrego água no bolso - disse Frodo.
- Pensamos que tivesse ido buscar - disse Píppín, arrumando a comida e as
xícaras. É melhor ir agora.
- Vocês também podem vir - disse Frodo -, e tragam todas as garrafas de água. Havia um riacho no pé da colina.
Encheram as garrafas e a pequena chaleira de acampamento
numa pequena cascata, onde a água caía de uma altura de mais ou menos um metro sobre uma
saliência rochosa cinzenta. Estava quase congelada, e eles bufaram e resfolegaram
ao lavar o rosto e as mãos.
Já eram mais de dez horas quando terminaram o desjejum e de arrumar as mochilas, e o dia
começava a ficar quente e agradável. Desceram a ladeira, e atravessaram
o riozinho no ponto em que ele mergulhava sob a estrada, e galgaram a próxima ladeira, e
então subiram e desceram outra saliência das colinas, após o que suas capas,
cobertores, água, comida e outros equipamentos já pareciam um fardo pesado.

A marcha do dia prometia ser quente e cansativa. Entretanto, depois de algumas milhas a
estrada não tinha mais tantos altos e baixos: subia ziguezagueando até o
topo de uma encosta íngreme, e então se preparava para descer pela última vez. À frente
eles viram as terras mais baixas, ponteadas com pequenos grupos de árvores
que na distância se desfaziam em névoa escura. Olhavam através da Ponta do Bosque em
direção ao rio Brandevin. A estrada dava voltas diante deles como um pedaço
de fio.
- A estrada vai seguindo sempre em frente - disse Pippin -, mas não consigo
continuar sem um descanso. Já está mais que na hora de almoçarmos. - Sentou-se
no barranco
à beira da estrada e olhou na distância em direção ao leste, dentro da névoa, além da
qual ficava o Rio e o fim do Condado onde tinha passado toda sua vida. Sam
estava perto dele, os olhos redondos bem abertos - pois estava olhando, através de terras
que nunca tinha visto, para um novo horizonte.
- Os elfos moram nesses bosques? - perguntou ele.
- Não que eu saiba - disse Pippin.
Frodo estava em silêncio. Também ele olhava ao longo da estrada em direção ao
leste, como se nunca tivesse visto aquilo antes. De
repente falou, em voz alta, mas como se fosse para si mesmo, dizendo devagar:
A Estrada em frente vai seguindo Deixando a porta onde começa.
Agora longejá vai indo,
Devo seguir, nada me impeça;
#76
Por seus percalços vão meus pés,
Até ajunção com a grande estrada, De muitas sendas através.
Que vem depois? Não sei mais nada.
- isso é parecido com um trecho dos versos do velho Bilbo - disse Pippin. - Ou é uma das
suas imitações? Não parece muito encorajador.
- Não sei - disse Frodo. - Ocorreu-me, como se eu estivesse compondo; mas posso ter
escutado há muito tempo. Certamente me lembra muito Bilbo nos últimos anos, antes
de ir embora, Ele costumava sempre dizer que só havia uma Estrada, que se assemelhava a
um grande rio: suas nascentes estavam em todas as portas, e todos os caminhos
eram seus afluentes. "É perigoso sair porta afora, Frodo", ele costumava dizer. "Você
pisa na Estrada, e, se não controlar seus pés, não há como saber até onde você
pode ser levado. Você percebe que é exatamente esse o caminho que atravessa a Floresta
das Trevas, e que, se você deixar, poderá levar você até a Montanha Solitária
e muito mais além, e para lugares piores?" Costumava dizer isso no caminho que passava
pela porta de Bolsão, principalmente depois de ter feito uma longa caminhada.
- Bem, a Estrada não vai me arrastar a lugar nenhum, pelo menos pela próxima hora - disse
Pippin, desafivelando sua mochila.
Os outros seguiram o exemplo, colocando
as suas no barranco e esticando as pernas sobre a estrada. Depois de descansar, almoçaram
bem, e então descansaram mais.
O sol estava começando a abaixar e a luz da tarde estava sobre a paisagem quando desceram
a colina. Até agora não tinham encontrado vivalma na estrada. Esse caminho
não era muito usado, sendo pouco adequado para carroças, e havia pouco trânsito na Ponta
do Bosque. Já estavam andando havia uma hora ou mais quando Sam parou por
um momento, como se escutasse algo. Estavam agora em terreno plano, e a estrada, depois
de muitas curvas, estendia-se em linha reta através de um capinzal salpicado
de árvores altas, sentinelas avançadas das florestas que se aproximavam.
- Ouço um pônei ou um cavalo vindo pela estrada - disse Sam. Olharam para trás, mas uma
curva os impedia de enxergar muito além.
- Imagino se não é Gandalf, vindo atrás de nós - disse Frodo; mas enquanto falava, teve
um pressentimento de que não era, e se sentiu dominado por um desejo repentino
de sumir da vista do cavaleiro.

- Pode não fazer muita diferença - disse ele se desculpando -, mas prefiro não ser visto
na estrada - por ninguém. Estou cansado de comentários sobre o que faço.
E se for Gandalf - acrescentou ele, completando o pensamento - podemos fazer-lhe uma
pequena surpresa, puni-lo por
estar-tão atrasado. Vamos nos esconder!
#77
Os outros dois correram para a esquerda e desceram até uma pequena concavidade não muito
distante da estrada. Deitaram-se no solo. Frodo hesitou por um momento:
a curiosidade ou algum outro sentimento lutava contra seu desejo de se esconder.
O som de cascos se aproximou. Bem na hora, ele se jogou numa moita alta atrás de
uma árvore que cobria a estrada de sombra. Então levantou a cabeça e espiou
cuidadosamente por cima de
uma das raízes grandes.
Pela curva vinha um cavalo negro, não um pônei de hobbit, mas um cavalo grande: montado
por um homem grande, que parecia abaixado na sela, envolto numa grande capa
e num capuz preto, de modo que só se viam as botas nos estribos altos.
O rosto, coberto por uma sombra, era invisível.
Quando chegou à árvore onde estava Frodo, o cavalo parou. A figura do cavaleiro
permanecia imóvel com a cabeça abaixada, como que tentando escutar algo. De dentro
do capuz veio um ruído, como se alguém tentasse farejar um cheiro indefinível; a cabeça
se virava para os dois lados da estrada.
Um medo repentino e insensato de ser descoberto tomou conta de Frodo, que pensou no Anel.
Mal ousava respirar, e mesmo assim a vontade de retirá-lo do bolso se tornou
tão forte que sua mão começou lentamente a se mover. Sentia que era só colocá-lo, e
ficaria a salvo.
O conselho de Gandalf parecia absurdo. Bilbo tinha usado o Anel.
"E ainda estou no Condado", pensava ele, no momento em que sua mão alcançou a corrente em
que estava o Anel. Nesse momento o cavaleiro sentou-se ereto e sacudiu
as rédeas.
O cavalo avançou, primeiro andando devagar, para depois romper num trote rápido.
Frodo se arrastou até a beira da estrada e ficou olhando o cavaleiro, até que desapareceu
na distância. Não podia ter certeza, mas teve a impressão de que, de repente,
antes que sumisse de vista, o cavalo tinha virado para o lado e entrado no mato à
direita.
- Bem, acho isso estranho, e na verdade perturbador - falou Frodo consigo mesmo, enquanto
andava em direção aos companheiros. Pippin e Sam permaneciam deitados no
chão, e não tinham visto nada; então Frodo descreveu o cavaleiro e seu comportamento
estranho.
- Não sei por que, mas tive certeza de que estava me procurando ou mefarejando; e também
tive certeza de que eu não queria que me descobrisse. Nunca vi ou senti
algo assim no Condado antes.
- Mas o que teria umas das pessoas grandes a ver conosco? - disse Pippin. - E o que
estaria fazendo nesta parte do mundo?
-Existem alguns homens por aí - disse Frodo. - Lá embaixo, na Quarta Sul, andaram tendo
problemas com as pessoas grandes, eu acho. Mas nunca soube de nada como este
cavaleiro. Fico imaginando de onde veio.
#78
- Desculpe - interrompeu Sam. - Eu sei de onde ele vem. É da Vila dos Hobbits que este
cavaleiro vem, a não ser que exista mais de um. E
sei para onde vai.
- O que quer dizer? - disse Frodo abruptamente, olhando para ele assombrado. - Por que
não falou nada antes?
- Só lembrei agora, senhor. Foi assim: quando volto para a nossa toca ontem à noite com a
chave, meu pai diz para mim: Oi, Sam, diz ele. Achei que tinha ido embora

com o Sr. Frodo hoje cedo. Passou por aqui um camarada estranho perguntando pelo Sr.
Bolseiro de Bolsão, e ele acabou de sair. Mandei-o para Buqueburgo. Não que
tenha gostado do jeito dele. Parecia muito furioso quando eu disse que o Sr. Bolseiro
tinha deixado sua velha casa para sempre. Chiou na minha cara! Me deu um arrepio.
Que tipo de pessoa pode ser?, digo eu para o Feitor. Eu não sei, diz ele; mas não era um
hobbit. Ele era alto e parecia negro, e se inclinava em cima de mim. Acho
que era uma das pessoas grandes, dos lugares distantes. Elefalava esquisito.
- Não pude ficar para ouvir mais, já que o senhor estava à minha espera; e não dei muita
atenção a isso.
O Feitor está ficando velho, e bem cego, e devia estar quase
escuro quando esse camarada subiu a Colina e o encontrou tomando ar no fim de nossa rua.
Espero que ele não tenha feito nenhum mal, senhor, nem eu.
- De qualquerjeito, a culpa não é dele - disse Frodo. - Para falar a verdade, eu o
escutei conversando com um estranho, que parecia perguntar por mim, e quase fui
até lá saber quem era. Gostaria de ter ido, ou que você tivesse me contado isso antes.
Devia ter tomado mais cuidado na estrada.
- Ainda assim, pode não haver ligação alguma entre o sujeito estranho do Feitor e este
cavaleiro - disse Pippin. - Saímos da Vila dos Hobbits em segredo, e eu não
vejo como ele possa nos ter seguido.
- Devia ter esperado Gandalf - murmurou Frodo. - Mas talvez isso só piorasse as coisas.
- Então você sabe ou imagina alguma coisa sobre este cavaleiro? disse Pippin, que
escutara essas últimas palavras.
- Não sei, e preferia não adivinhar - disse Frodo.
- Tudo bem, primo Frodo! Pode guardar o seu segredo por agora, se quiser fazer mistério.
Mas enquanto isso, que vamos fazer? Gostaria de beliscar alguma coisa, mas
algo me diz que devemos sair daqui. Essa conversa de cavaleiro farejador com nariz
invisível me deixou inquieto.
- É, acho que vamos agora - disse Frodo - mas não pela estrada como prevenção, caso
aquele cavaleiro volte, ou outro o siga. Temos muito chão pela frente hoje. A
Terra dos Buques ainda está a milhas daqui.
As árvores lançavam sombras altas e esguias sobre o mato quando partiram novamente. Agora
se mantinham a certa distância da estrada, do lado
#79
esquerdo, e escondidos o máximo possível. Mas isso os atrasou, pois o mato era espesso e
cheio de moitas, e o solo irregular, as árvores já começando a se agrupar
em feixes.
O sol já baixava, vermelho, além das montanhas atrás deles, e a tarde já avançava quando
voltaram para a estrada, no final de um longo trecho plano e reto que se
estendera por algumas milhas. Naquele ponto descrevia uma curva e descia para as terras
da Baixada, seguindo para Tronco; mas havia uma ramificação à direita, que
desenhava curvas e entrava numa floresta de velhos carvalhos, em direção à Vila do
Bosque.
- Este é o nosso caminho - disse Frodo.
Não muito distante da bifurcação, encontraram o tronco de uma enorme árvore:
ainda estava viva e tinha folhas nos pequenos ramos crescidos em volta dos tocos
quebrados
de seus galhos caídos havia muito; mas era oca, e podia-se entrar nela através de uma
grande fissura no lado oposto à estrada. Os hobbits se arrastaram para dentro,
e lá sentaram sobre o chão de folhas velhas e madeira podre. Descansaram e fizeram uma
refeição leve, conversando baixo e parando para escutar de tempo em tempo.
Já os envolvia o crepúsculo quando se puseram a caminho. O vento Oeste suspirava nos
galhos. As folhas sussurravam. Logo a estrada começou a mergulhar de leve, mas
continuamente, no lusco-fusco. Uma estrela surgiu sobre as árvores no Leste que escurecia
diante deles. Caminhavam lado a lado no mesmo passo, para manter o ânimo.
Depois de um tempo, à medida que as estrelas aumentavam em número e brilho, a inquietação
os deixou, e eles pararam de prestar atenção ao som de cascos. Começaram

a cantar baixinho, como os bobbits fazem ao caminhar juntos, especialmente quando se
aproximam dos lares à noite. Para a maioria dos hobbits, é uma cantiga de ceia
ou de dormir; mas para esses hobbits era uma cantiga de caminhar (embora não deixasse, é
claro, de mencionar a ceia e a cama). Bilbo Bolseiro tinha feito a letra
para uma melodia antiga como as colinas, e ensinou-a a Frodo quando caminhavam nas
ladeiras do vale do Água, e conversavam sobre Aventura.
Sobre a lareira arde a chama, E sob o teto há uma cama;
Mas nossos pés vão mais andar, Ali na esquina pode estar Árvore alta ou rochedofrio Que
ninguém sabe ninguém viu.
Folha e relva, árvore eflor Deixa passar aonde for! Água e monte vão chegando, Vai
passando! Vai passando!
#80
Talvez te espere noutra esquina Porta secreta ou nova sina.
E se hoje nós passarmos por elas, Amanhã podemos revê-las
E seguir a senda secreta
Que o Sol e a Lua têm por meta.
Maçã e espinho, noz e ameixa, Deixa passar! Deixa, deixa! Pedra e areia, lagoa e vargem,
Boa viagem! Boa viagem!
Lá atrás a casa, emfrente o mundo, Muitas trilhas ao vagabundo,
Pelas sombras do anoitecer, Té a última estrela aparecer. Agora o mundojá não chama,
Voltemos pra casa e para a cama.
Nuvem, sombra, dúbia neblina, Deixa a retina, deixa a retina! Água e comida, luz e chama,
Ejá pra cama! Já pra cama!
A cantiga terminou.
- E agora pra cama! Agora pra cama! - cantou Pippin bem alto.
- Quieto! - disse Frodo. - Acho que ouvi cascos de novo.
Pararam de repente e ficaram quietos como sombras de árvores, escutando. Havia um som de
cascos no caminho, um pouco atrás, mas que se aproximava devagar. Saíram
do caminho rápida e silenciosamente, correndo para a sombra mais profunda embaixo dos
carvalhos.
- Não vamos muito longe! - disse Frodo. - Não quero ser visto, mas quero ver se é outro
Cavaleiro Negro.
- Muito bem! - disse Pippin. - Mas não esqueça que ele fareja!
Os cascos se aproximaram. Não tinham tempo para encontrar um esconderijo melhor que a
escuridão geral sob as árvores; Sam e Pippin se agacharam atrás de um tronco,
enquanto Frodo se arrastava alguns metros em direção ao caminho, que se mostrava cinzento
e pálido, uma linha de luz sumindo através da floresta. Acima, o céu claro
estava coalhado de estrelas, mas não havia luar.
O barulho de cascos parou. Olhando, Frodo viu alguma coisa escura atravessar o espaço
mais claro entre duas árvores, e depois parar. Parecia a sombra negra de um
cavalo, conduzida por uma sombra negra menor. A sombra ficou parada perto do ponto onde
tinham abandonado o caminho, e se
#81
se virava de um lado para outro. Frodo pensou ouvir o som de alguém farejando. A sombra
se abaixou até o solo, e começou a avançar em direção a ele.
Mais uma vez, o desejo de colocar o Anel se apossou de Frodo; agora mais forte que antes.
Tão forte que, sem perceber o que estava fazendo, sua mão já tateava o
bolso. Mas neste momento veio um som semelhante ao de música e risadas misturadas. Som de
vozes perfeitamente audíveis, mais altas e depois mais baixas, através
do ar iluminado pela luz das estrelas. A sombra negra se endireitou e se afastou. Montou
a sombra do cavalo e pareceu desaparecer através do caminho, dentro da escuridão
do outro lado. Frodo pôde respirar novamente.
- Elfos! - exclamou Sam num sussurro rouco. - Elfos, senhor! - Poderia ter se jogado à
frente das árvores e corrido na direção das vozes, se os outros não o tivessem

segurado.
- Sim, são elfos - disse Frodo. - Pode-se encontrá-los de vez em quando na Ponta do
Bosque. Não moram no Condado, mas vagueiam por aqui na primavera e no outono,
vindos de suas terras além das Colinas das Torres. Ainda bem que fazem isso! Vocês não
viram, mas aquele Cavaleiro Negro parou bem aqui, e estava realmente vindo
em nossa direção quando a música começou. Assim que escutou as vozes, ele fugiu.
- E os elfos? - disse Sam, entusiasmado demais para se preocupar com o cavaleiro. Podemos ir até lá para vê-los?
- Escutem! Estão vindo para cá - disse Frodo. - Temos só de esperar. A cantoria chegou
mais perto. Uma das vozes podia agora ser ouvida acima das outras. Cantava
na bela língua dos elfos, que Frodo entendia um pouco, e os outros não conheciam. Apesar
disso, na imaginação deles, o som combinado com a melodia parecia tomar
a forma de palavras que entendiam só em parte. Frodo escutou a canção assim:
Branca-de-Neve! Clara Senhora! Reinas além dos Mares Poentes! És nossa Luz aqui nesta
hora
No mundo das arvores oni
presentes!
ó Gilthoniel! ó Elbereth!
De hálito puro e claro olhar! Branca-de-Neve, a ti nossa voz Em longes terras, além do
Mar.
Estrelas que, no Ano sem Sol, Pela sua mãofOstes semeadas,
Em campos de vento, em claro arrebol, Agora soisflores prateadas.
#82
ó Elbereth, ó Gilthoniel!
Inda lembramos, nós que moramos Nesta lonjura, em matas silentes,
A luz dos astros nos Mares Poentes.
A canção terminou.
- Estes são Altos-elfos! Falaram o nome de Elbereth!
- disse Frodo surpreso. - Esse belo povo raramente é visto no Condado. Poucos ainda
permanecem na Terra-média, a leste do Grande Mar. De fato, um acaso estranho!
Os hobbits se sentaram na sombra ao lado do caminho. Logo os elfos desceram por ele em
direção ao vale. Passaram devagar, e os hobbits puderam ver a luz das estrelas
brilhando nos olhos e cabelos deles. Não levavam qualquer luz, e mesmo assim, conforme
caminhavam, um clarão, como a luz da lua que aparece sobre a borda das montanhas
anunciando sua chegada, parecia iluminar seus pés. Agora estavam em silêncio, e o último
elfo, ao passar, se voltou e olhou em direção aos hobbits, rindo.
- Salve, Frodo - gritou ele. - Você está fora de casa tarde da noite. Ou será que está
perdido? - Então gritou pelos outros, e todo o grupo parou e se juntou em
volta deles.
- Isto é realmente maravilhoso! - disseram eles. - Três hobbits numa floresta à noite.
Não vemos uma coisa dessas desde que Bilbo foi embora. Que significa isto?
- Isto simplesmente significa, belo povo, que parece que estamos indo pelo mesmo caminho
que vocês. Gosto de andar sob as estrelas. Mas a sua companhia seria bem-vinda.
- Mas não precisamos de outra companhia, e os hobbits são tão enfadonhos - riram eles. E como você sabe que estamos indo pelo mesmo caminho que vocês, já que não
sabem aonde estamos indo?
- E como você sabe meu nome? - perguntou Frodo.
- Sabemos de muitas coisas - disseram eles. - Já o vimos antes muitas vezes com Bilbo,
embora vocês possam não nos ter visto.
- Quem são vocês, e quem é o seu senhor?
- Sou Gildor - respondeu o líder, o elfo que o tinha chamado primeiro.
- Gildor Inglorion da Casa de Finrod. Somos Exilados, e a maioria de nossos parentes
partiu há muito tempo, e também nós vamos permanecer aqui apenas um pouco,
antes
de nosso retorno pelo Grande Mar. Mas alguns de nosso povo ainda moram em paz em
Valfenda. Agora vamos, Frodo, contenos o que está fazendo. Pois vemos uma sombra
de medo em você.

- ó Povo Sábio! - interrompeu Pippin ansiosamente. - Contem-nos sobre os Cavaleiros
Negros!
- Cavaleiros Negros? - disseram em voz baixa. - Por que estão perguntando sobre
Cavaleiros Negros?
#83
- Porque dois Cavaleiros Negros passaram por nós hoje, ou um deles duas vezes - disse
Pippin. - Agora há pouco fugiu, quando vocês se aproximaram.
Os elfos não responderam imediatamente, mas conversaram entre si num tom baixo, em sua
própria língua. Finalmente Gildor voltou-se para os hobbits. - Não vamos falar
disso aqui - disse ele. -Achamos que é melhor virem conosco. Não é nosso hábito, mas
desta vez levaremos vocês pela nossa estrada, e vocês vão se hospedar conosco
esta noite, se quiserem.
- ó Belo Povo, isto é boa sorte além do que esperava - disse Pippin. Sam estava mudo. Agradeço-lhe muito, Gildor Inglorion - disse Frodo, fazendo uma reverência.
- Elen síla lúmenn omentielvo, uma estrela brilha sobre a hora do nosso encontro acrescentou ele, na língua dos Altos-elfos.
- Tenham cuidado, amigos - gritou Gildor rindo. - Não digam segredos! Aqui está um
estudioso da Língua Antiga. Bilbo foi um bom mestre. Salve, amigo-dos-elfos! disse ele fazendo uma reverência a Frodo. - Venha agora com seus amigos e junte-se ao
nosso grupo! É melhor andarem no meio, para não se perderem. Podem ficar cansados
antes de pararmos.
- Por quê? Aonde vamos? - perguntou Frodo.
Por hoje vamos para a floresta nas colinas sobre a Vila do Bosque. Fica a algumas milhas,
mas vão ter de descansar no final, e isto encurtará a sua viagem amanhã.
Agora continuavam a marcha em silêncio, e passavam como sombras e luzes fracas: os elfos
(mais ainda que os hobbits) sabiam andar sem fazer nenhum ruído, se desejassem.
Pippin começou logo a ficar sonolento e cambaleou uma ou duas vezes; sempre um elfo ao
seu lado estendia o braço, evitando que-caísse. Sam andava ao lado de Frodo,
como se sonhasse, com uma expressão no rosto que misturava medo e uma alegria atônita.
A floresta em ambos os lados se tornou mais densa; as árvores agora eram mais jovens e
espessas; e conforme o caminho descia, entrando numa dobra das montanhas,
havia profundas moitas de aveleiras nas ladeiras dos dois lados. Finalmente os elfos
deixaram o caminho virando à direita. Uma trilha verde quase invisível passava
pelas moitas; e por ela seguiram, através de curvas que voltavam a subir as ladeiras, até
o topo de uma saliência das colinas, que altiva se projetava sobre a parte
mais baixa do vale do rio. De repente saíram da sombra das árvores, e diante deles estava
um espaço grande de capim baixo, cinzento no escuro da noite. De três lados,
a floresta avançava por cima dele, mas ao leste o solo descia vertiginosamente, e as
copas das árvores escuras que cresciam no fundo da ladeira ficavam abaixo de
seus pés. Mais além, as terras baixas se estendiam escuras e planas sob as estrelas. Mais
próximas, algumas luzes brilhavam na aldeia da Vila do Bosque.
#84
Os elfos sentaram-se no capim e conversaram em voz baixa; pareciam não tomar mais
conhecimento dos hobbits. Frodo e seus companheiros se embrulharam em capas e
cobertores, tomados pelo sono. A noite avançou, e as luzes no vale se apagaram. Pippin
adormeceu, com a cabeça apoiada num outeiro verde.
Lá em cima no Leste oscilavam Remmirath, as Estrelas Enredadas, e lenta acima da névoa a
vermelha Borgil se levantava, brilhando como uma jóia de fogo. Então, por
alguma mudança de ar, toda a névoa foi retirada como um véu; e ali subia, como se
escalasse a borda do mundo, o Espadachim do Céu, Menelvagor com seu cinto brilhante.
Todos os elfos começaram a cantar. De repente, sob as árvores, uma fogueira se acendeu
com uma luz vermelha.
- Venham! - disseram os elfos chamando os hobbits. Agora é hora de conversar e de se
divertir!

Pippin se sentou, esfregando os olhos. Tremeu. - Há um fogo no salão, e comida para
convidados famintos - disse um elfo parado diante dele. Na ponta sul do gramado
havia uma abertura. Ali o solo verde entrava na floresta, e formava um amplo espaço
como um salão, coberto pelos ramos das árvores. Os grandes troncos se alinhavam como
pilares em cada um dos lados. No meio
ficava uma fogueira, e nas árvores-pilares, tochas com luzes de ouro e prata
queimavam continuamente. Os elfos se sentaram em volta da fogueira, sobre a grama ou
sobre rodelas serradas de velhos troncos. Alguns iam e vinham carregando taças e servindo
bebidas; outros traziam comida em montes de pratos e bandejas.
- É uma refeição modesta - disseram eles aos hobbits - pois estamos alojados na floresta,
longe de nossos salões. Se alguma vez forem à nossa casa, serão mais bem
tratados.
- A mim parece bom o suficiente para uma festa de aniversário - disse Frodo.
Mais tarde, Pippin se lembraria muito pouco da comida e da bebida, pois sua mente estava
tomada pela luz nos rostos dos elfos, e pelos sons de vozes, tão variadas
e bonitas que o faziam sentir-se como se estivesse sonhando acordado. Mas saberia dizer
que houve pão, cujo sabor superava o de uma bela bengala de pão branco para
alguém que está morrendo de fome; e frutas doces como pomos silvestres e mais saborosas
que as cultivadas em jardins; ele esvaziou um copo cheio de uma bebida aromática,
fresca e transparente como água de fonte, dourada como uma tarde de verão.
Sam jamais poderia descrever em palavras, nem representar de modo claro para si mesmo, o
que sentiu ou pensou naquela noite que, apesar disso, ficou-lhe gravada
na memória como um dos acontecimentos mais importantes da sua vida. O mais próximo disso
a que conseguiu chegar foi dizer:
- Bem, senhor, se eu pudesse cultivar maçãs assim, diria que sou um hortelão.
#85
Mas foram as canções que tocaram meu coração, se entende o que quero dizer.
Frodo estava sentado, comendo, bebendo e conversando com prazer; mas sua mente se
concentrava nas palavras ditas. Sabia um pouco da língua élfica, e escutava atento.
De vez em quando falava com aqueles que o serviam, e lhes agradecia na língua deles. Em
contrapartida, sorriam e diziam
: - Aqui está uma jóia rara entre os hobbits.
Depois de um tempo Pippin adormeceu profundamente, e foi levantado e levado para
um abrigo sob as árvores; ali o deitaram num leito macio onde dormiu o resto
da
noite. Sam se recusou a deixar seu mestre. Quando pippin tinha ido, ele veio e se sentou
encolhido perto de Frodo, onde finalmente pendeu de sono e fechou os olhos.
Frodo permaneceu por muito tempo acordado, conversando com Gildor.
Falaram de muitas coisas, velhas e novas, e Frodo perguntou muito sobre os acontecimentos
no vasto mundo fora do Condado. As novidades eram na maioria tristes e
agourentas: uma escuridão que crescia, as guerras dos homens e a fuga dos elfos.
Finalmente Frodo fez a pergunta que calava mais fundo em seu coração.
- Diga-me, Gildor, você viu Bilbo depois que ele nos deixou? Gildor sorriu. - Sim respondeu ele. - Duas vezes. Disse-me adeus aqui mesmo. Mas o vi uma outra vez,
longe daqui. - Não disse mais nada sobre Bilbo, e Frodo ficou em silêncio.
- Você não me pergunta ou fala muito sobre as coisas que o preocupam, Frodo - disse
Gildor. - Mas eu já sei um pouco, e posso ler mais em seu rosto e no pensamento
por trás de suas perguntas. Você está deixando o Condado, e ainda assim duvida se poderá
encontrar o que procura, ou conseguir o que pretende, ou se algum dia retornará,
Não é isso?
- É sim - disse Frodo -, mas pensei que minha partida fosse um segredo conhecido apenas
por Gandalf e meu fiel Sam. - Olhou para Sam, que roncava baixinho.
- O segredo não chegará ao Inimigo por nosso intermédio - disse Gildor.
- O Inimigo? - disse Frodo. - Então você sabe por que estou deixando o Condado?
- Não sei por que motivo o Inimigo está perseguindo você - respondeu Gildor -, mas
percebo que está - embora isso me pareça muito estranho. E faço uma advertência:

o perigo agora está adiante e também atrás de você, e dos dois lados.
- Quer dizer os Cavaleiros? Receava que fossem servidores do Inimigo. O que são os
Cavaleiros Negros?
- Gandalf não lhe disse nada?
#86
- Sobre essas criaturas, nada.
- Então acho que não cabe a mim dizer mais - para evitar que o terror o impeça de
continuar a viagem. Pois a mim parece que você partiu em cima da hora, se é que
já não está atrasado. Deve se apressar, e não ficar e nem voltar; o Condado não oferece
proteção a você.
- Não consigo imaginar que informação possa ser mais terrível que suas insinuações e
advertências - exclamou Frodo. - É claro que sabia que havia perigo à minha
frente, mas não esperava encontrá-lo no nosso próprio Condado. Um hobbit não pode
caminhar do Água até o Rio em paz?
- Mas não é o seu próprio Condado - disse Gildor. - Outros moraram aqui antes dos
hobbits; e outros virão quando os hobbits não estiverem mais aqui.
O vasto mundo
está em volta de vocês. Podem se trancar aqui dentro, mas não trancá-lo lá fora.
- Eu sei - e apesar disso o Condado sempre me pareceu tão seguro e familiar. Que posso
fazer agora? Meu plano era sair do Condado em segredo, e ir até Valfenda;
mas agora meus passos estão sendo seguidos, antes mesmo de chegar à Terra dos Buques.
- Acho que ainda deve seguir esse plano - disse Gildor. - Não acho que a Estrada será
dura demais para sua coragem. Mas se desejar um conselho mais direto, deve
pedi-lo a Gandalf. Não sei o motivo de sua fuga, e por isso não sei por que meios seus
perseguidores vão atacá-lo. Isso Gandalf deve saber. Suponho que deve encontrá-lo
antes de deixar o Condado?
- Espero que sim. Mas esta é outra coisa que me deixa ansioso. Tenho esperado Gandalf há
muitos dias. Ele deveria ter chegado à Vila dos Hobbits no máximo há duas
noites; mas não apareceu. Agora fico imaginando o que pode ter acontecido. Será que devo
esperá-lo?
Gildor ficou em silêncio por um momento. - Não gosto dessa notícia
- disse ele finalmente. - O atraso de Gandalf não é um bom presságio. Mas dizem por aí:
Não se meta nas coisas dos magos, pois eles são sensíveis e ficam,facilmente
irritados. A escolha é sua: ir ou esperar.
- E também dizem por aí: Não peça conselhos aos elfos, pois eles dirão ao mesmo tempo não
e sim.
- É mesmo? - riu Gildor. - Os elfos raramente dão conselhos imprudentes, pois o conselho
é uma dádiva perigosa, mesmo dos sábios para os sábios, e tudo pode dar
errado. Mas e você? Se não me contou sobre tudo o que o preocupa, como posso fazer uma
escolha melhor que a sua? Mas se quer um conselho, vou dá-lo em nome de nossa
amizade. Acho que deve partir imediatamente, sem demora; e se Gandalf não chegar antes de
sua partida, então também aconselho o seguinte: não vá sozinho. Leve amigos,
que sejam confiáveis e prestativos. Agora, deve me agradecer, pois não dou este
conselho com tranqüilidade. Os elfos têm suas próprias dores e seus próprios
#87
labores, e não se preocupam muito com os assuntos dos hobbits, ou de qualquer outra
criatura sobre a terra. Nossos caminhos se cruzam raramente, por acaso
ou de propósito. Neste nosso encontro, pode haver algo mais que o acaso; mas o propósito
não está claro para mim, e temo falar demais.
- Fico imensamente grato - disse Frodo - mas queria que dissesse de modo direto o que são
os Cavaleiros Negros. Se seguir seu conselho, posso não encontrar Gandalf
por um longo tempo, e preciso saber qual é o perigo que me persegue.
- Não basta saber que são servidores do Inimigo? - respondeu Gildor.

- Fuja deles! Não fale com eles! São letais. Não me pergunte mais nada! Mas meu coração
pressente que, antes que tudo se acabe, você, Frodo, filho de Drogo, saberá
mais sobre essas coisas terríveis que Gildor Inglorion. Que Elbereth o proteja!
- Mas onde buscarei coragem? - perguntou Frodo. - É disso que eu mais preciso.
-A coragem pode ser encontrada em lugares improváveis - disse Gildor. Tenha esperança!
Durma agora! Pela manhã deveremos ter partido, mas enviaremos nossas mensagens
por todo lugar. Os Grupos Errantes vão saber de sua viagem, e aqueles que têm poder para
o bem estarão vigiando. Nomeio-o
amigo-dos-elfos, e que as estrelas brilhem
sobre o final de seu caminho! Raramente tivemos tanto prazer na companhia de estranhos, e
é bonito escutar palavras da Língua Antiga dos lábios de outros andarilhos
do mundo.
Frodo sentiu-se sonolento, ainda enquanto Gildor terminava de falar.
- Vou dormir agora - disse ele, e o elfo o conduziu a um abrigo ao lado de Pippin, e ele
se jogou sobre um leito, caindo imediatamente num sono sem sonhos.

CAPíTULO IV
ATALHO ATÉ COGUMELOS

Na manhã seguinte, Frodo acordou descansado. Estava deitado no abrigo de uma árvore viva,
com ramos entrelaçados que desciam até o chão; o leito era de grama e samambaias,
fundo, macio e com um cheiro exótico.
O sol brilhava através das folhas que se agitavam, ainda verdes, no topo da árvore. Pulou
de pé
e saiu.
Sam estava sentado na grama perto da borda da floresta. Pippin, em pé, estudava o céu e o
tempo. Nenhum sinal dos elfos.
- Deixaram frutas e bebida, e pão - disse Pippin. - Venha comer. O pão está quase tão bom
como ontem à noite. Eu não queria deixar nenhum para você, mas Sam insistiu.
Frodo se sentou ao lado de Sam e começou a comer. - Quais são os planos para hoje? perguntou Pippin.
- Chegar a Buqueburgo o mais rápido possível - respondeu Frodo, voltando a atenção para a
comida.
- Você acha que veremos algum sinal daqueles Cavaleiros? - perguntou Pippin animado. Sob
o sol da manhã, a perspectiva de encontrar uma tropa inteira deles não lhe
parecia muito alarmante.
- Provavelmente sim - disse Frodo, não apreciando muito o lembrete.
- Mas espero atravessar o Rio sem que nos vejam.
Gildor lhe revelou alguma coisa sobre eles?
- Não muito - apenas insinuou coisas com frases enigmáticas - respondeu Frodo
evasivamente.
- Você perguntou alguma coisa sobre eles farejarem?
- Não discutimos isso - disse Frodo, com a boca cheia.
- Deveriam ter discutido. Tenho certeza de que é muito importante.
- Nesse caso estou certo de que Gildor se recusaria a explicar - disse Frodo secamente. E agora me deixe um pouco em paz! Não quero responder uma lista de perguntas
enquanto como. Quero pensar!
Puxa vida! - disse Pippin. - Durante o desjejum? - E andou em direção à borda da
floresta.

Da mente de Frodo, aquela manhã clara - traiçoeiramente clara, pensava ele - não tinha
expulsado o medo da perseguição, e ele ponderava as palavras de Gildor. A
voz alegre de Pippin chegou-lhe aos ouvidos. Estava correndo sobre a grama verde e
cantando.
"Não! Eu não poderia!" disse ele consigo mesmo. "Uma coisa é levar meus jovens amigos
para passear pelo Condado, até ficarmos famintos e
#90
cansados, quando temos boa cama e comida. Levá-los para o exílio, onde a fome e o cansaço
podem não ter cura, é bem diferente - mesmo que se julguem dispostos a
vir. A herança é só minha. Nem Sam acho que devo levar." Olhou para Sam
Gamgi, e percebeu que ele o observava.
Bem, Sam! - disse ele. - Que acha disso? Vou deixar o Condado o mais rápido que puder tomei a decisão de não esperar nem um dia em Cricôncavo, se isso puder ser
evitado.
Muito bom, senhor!
Você ainda quer vir comigo?
- Quero.
- Vai ser muito perigoso, Sam. Já está perigoso. Existem grandes chances de nenhum de nós
voltar vivo.
- Se o senhor não voltar, então certamente também não voltarei, isto é certo. Não o
deixe!, disseram para mim. Deixá-lo!, eu disse. Nunca pensei nisso. Vou com ele,
mesmo que suba até a Lua; e se qualquer um daqueles Cavaleiros Negros tentar impedi-lo,
terão que se ver com
Sam Gamgi, eu disse. Eles riram.
- Quem são eles, e de que está falando?
- Os elfos, senhor. Conversaram comigo ontem à noite, e pareciam saber que o senhor
estava indo embora, então não vi motivo para negar isso. Que povo maravilhoso,
os elfos, senhor! Maravilhoso!
- São mesmo - disse Frodo. - Você continua gostando deles, agora que os viu mais de
perto?
- Eles parecem estar um pouco acima do meu gostar ou desgostar, por assim dizer respondeu Sam devagar. - Parece que não tem muita importância o que acho
deles, São
muito diferentes do que esperava - tão velhos e jovens, e tão alegres e tristes, de certo
modo...
Frodo riu de Sam, bastante surpreso, como quem esperasse enxergar algum sinal externo da
estranha mudança que se operara nele. Não parecia a voz do velho Sam
Gamgi
que julgava conhecer. Mas era o mesmo Sam Gamgi ali sentado, a não ser por sua expressão
extraordinariamente pensativa.
- Você acha necessário deixar o Condado agora - agora que seu desejo de vê-los já se
realizou? - perguntou ele.
- Sim, senhor. Não sei como dizer isto, mas depois de ontem à noite me sinto diferente.
Parece que enxergo mais longe, de certa maneira. Sei que vamos pegar uma
estrada muito longa, para dentro da escuridão; mas sei também que não posso voltar.
O que quero agora não é ver os elfos, nem dragões e nem montanhas - não sei direito
o que quero: mas tenho alguma coisa para fazer antes do fim, e ela está lá na frente,
longe do Condado. Preciso passar por isso, se é que o senhor me entende.
- Não entendo muito bem. Mas percebo que Gandalf escolheu para mim um bom companheiro.
Estou contente. Nós vamos juntos.
#91
Frodo terminou de comer em silêncio. Então, levantando-se, examiDou a região diante dele,
e chamou Pippin.
-Todos prontos para partir? - disse ele enquanto Pippin subia correndo. - Precisamos ir
imediatamente. Dormimos até tarde, e temos muitas milhas pela frente.

- Você dormiu até tarde - disse Pippin. - Já estou acordado há muito tempo; e estamos só
esperando você terminar de comer e de pensar.
- Já terminei as duas coisas. E vou partir para a balsa de Buqueburgo o mais rápido
possível. Mas se for pela estrada que deixamos ontem à noite vamos ficar dando
voltas: vou sair daqui, cortando caminho pelo campo.
- Então você vai voar - disse Pippin. - Você não vai encontrar atalhos em lugar algum
neste trecho.
- Mas de qualquer modo podemos fazer um percurso mais curto que a estrada - respondeu
Frodo. - A balsa fica a leste da Vila do Bosque, mas a estrada grande faz uma
curva para a esquerda - dá para ver um cotovelo ali ao norte. Ela contorna o extremo
norte do Pântano, a fim de encontrar o caminho que vem da Ponte sobre Tronco.
São muitas milhas fora do rumo. Poderíamos economizar um quarto da distância se fôssemos
em linha reta daqui onde estamos até a balsa.
- Todo atalho dá trabalho - argumentou Pippin. - O campo é acidentado por essas
bandas, e existem atoleiros e todo tipo de dificuldade lá embaixo no Pântano
- conheço
a região naquelas partes. E se está preocupado com os Cavaleiros Negros, não vejo por que
encontrá-los na estrada seja pior do que numa floresta ou num campo.
- É menos fácil encontrar pessoas nas florestas e campos - respondeu Frodo. - E se a
expectativa é de que você esteja na estrada, existe mais chance de ser procurado
na estrada, e não fora dela.
- Muito bem! - disse Pippin. - Seguirei você por todos os atoleiros e valas. Mas o
caminho é dificil! Contava em passar pelo Perca Dourada em Tronco antes do pôr-do-sol.
Lá servem a melhor cerveja da Quarta Leste, ou pelo menos serviam: faz muito tempo que
não experimento.
- Isso resolve o assunto! - disse Frodo. - Todo atalho dá trabalho, mas hospedarias dão
mais ainda. A todo custo temos de nos manter longe do Perca Dourada. Queremos
chegar a Buqueburgo antes de escurecer. O que me diz, Sam?
- Vou junto com o senhor, Sr. Frodo - disse Sam (mesmo tendo um pressentimento oculto e
sentindo um grande pesar por perder a melhor cerveja da Quarta Leste).
- Então, se temos de nos embrenhar por atoleiros e urzes, vamos já! disse Pippin.
#92
OO calor já estava quase igual ao do dia anterior, mas nuvens começavam a chegar do
Oeste. Parecia que ia chover. Os hobbits desceram aos tropeços por uma ladeira
verde e íngreme e se enfiaram entre densas árvores lá embaixo. A direção escolhida
deixava a Vila do Bosque à esquerda e cortava num plano inclinado através dos
maciços de árvores que se estendiam na face leste da colina, até que alcançassem as
planícies à frente. Então poderiam ir direto para a balsa pelo campo que era
aberto, a não ser por algumas valas e cercas. Frodo calculava que teriam de caminhar
dezoito milhas, indo em linha reta.
Logo descobriu que a floresta era mais densa e emaranhada do que parecera à primeira
vista. Não havia trilhas na vegetação baixa, e eles não podiam avançar muito
rápido. Quando alcançaram o final da ladeira, encontraram um riacho que vinha das colinas
lá atrás e corria sobre um leito profundo, do qual subiam margens íngremes
e escorregadias, cobertas por arbustos espinhosos. Muito inconvenientemente, o riacho
cortava a linha que tinham escolhido. Não podiam saltar por sobre ele e nem
atravessá-lo sem ficar molhados, arranhados e enlameados. Pararam, imaginando o que
fazer. - Primeiro obstáculo - disse Pippin, com um sorriso melancólico.
Sam Gamgi olhou para trás. Por uma abertura nas árvores, passou os olhos pelo topo da
ladeira pela qual tinha descido.
- Olhem - disse ele, agarrando o braço de Frodo. Todos olharam e na encosta, de pé,
contra o céu, viram bem acima deles um cavalo. Ao lado, uma figura negra,
Imediatamente desistiram da idéia de voltar. Frodo foi à frente, e se enfiou rapidamente
pelos densos arbustos que ladeavam o riacho. - Ufa! disse ele a Pippm. Nós dois estávamos certos! O atalho já deixou de ser em linha reta, mas conseguimos um
esconderijo bem na hora. Você tem bons ouvidos, Sam. Consegue escutar alguma
coisa vindo?

Ficaram todos quietos, quase prendendo a respiração para escutar; mas não havia nenhum
ruído indicando que estavam sendo perseguidos. Não acho que ele tentaria trazer
o cavalo ladeira abaixo - disse Sam. - Mas acho que sabe que viemos por aqui. É melhor
irmos andando,
Ir indo não foi nem um pouco fácil. Tinham mochilas para carregar e os arbustos e
espinheiros relutavam em deixá-los passar. Impedido pelo maciço de colinas atrás
deles, o vento deixara de soprar, e o ar estava parado e abafado. Quando finalmente
forçaram o caminho em direção ao terreno mais aberto, estavam com muito calor,
cansados e arranhados, e também não sabiam ao certo em que direção caminhavam. Na
planície as margens afundavam, e o riacho ficava mais largo e mais raso, indo em
direção ao Pântano e ao ffio.
- Mas este é o Córrego de Tronco! - disse Pippin. - Se é que vamos tentar voltar para
nosso caminho, temos imediatamente de atravessar e ir à direita.
#93
Foram atravessando o riacho, e se apressaram em direção a um espaço aberto
amplO, coberto de juncos e sem árvores, na margem oposta. Mais além encontraram um
cinturão
de árvores: em sua maioria altos carvalhos, entremeados aqui e ali com olmos e freixos.
O solo era bastante plano e havia pouca vegetação rasteira; mas as árvores
estavam muito próximas para que eles pudessem enxergar muito longe. Súbitas rajadas de
vento levavam as folhas pelos ares, e gotas de chuva começaram a cair do céu
carregado. Então o vento foi parando e a chuva começou a cair forte. Avançavam com
dificuldade, o mais rápido que conseguiam, em meio a tufos de grama e montes de
folhas mortas que boiavam na água, enquanto a chuva tamborilava e escorria por toda a sua
volta. Não conversavam, mas olhavam para trás e para os lados.
Depois de meia hora, Pippin disse:
- Espero que não tenhamos virado muito em direção ao sul e que não estejamos
andando ao longo da floresta!
O cinturão não é muito
largo - diria que não ultrapassa uma milha e já deveríamos tê-lo atravessado.
- Não adianta irmos em ziguezague - disse Frodo. - Isso não vai consertar as coisas.
Vamos continuar por aqui! Nem sei se já quero sair para o espaço aberto.
Continuaram talvez por mais algumas milhas. Então o sol brilhou através de nuvens
rasgadas e a chuva diminuiu, Agora já passava do meiodia, e sentiram que já estava
mais que na hora de almoçar. Pararam sob um olmo: as folhas, embora estivessem
rapidamente amarelecendo, ainda eram espessas, e o solo embaixo estava razoavelmente
seco e bem protegido. Quando começaram a fazer a refeição, descobriram que os elfos
tinham enchido suas garrafas com uma bebida clara, de um dourado pálido: tinha
o aroma de um mel feito de muitas flores e era maravilhosamente reconfortante. Logo
estavam rindo e desprezando a chuva e os Cavaleiros Negros. Sentiam que logo
deixariam para trás as últimas milhas.
Frodo encostou-se no tronco da árvore, fechando os olhos. Sam e Pippin se sentaram perto
e começaram a cantar baixinho:
Eh! Eli! Eli! O que eu quero é beber, Matar minha dor e o meu mal esquecer Pode ventar
também pode chover
E muita estrada sobrar pra vencer, Ao pé deste olmo eu quero deitar
E olhar para a nuvem que vai devagar
Eh! Eli! Eh!, começaram de novo, mais alto. Pararam de repente. Frodo pulou de pé. Um
gemido longo veio com o vento,
como o choro de alguma
#94
criatura solitária e má. Ficou mais alto e depois mais baixo, e então terminou num tom
muito agudo e penetrante. Eles ficaram escutando,
como que petrificados,

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
e o lamento foi respondido por um outro grito, mais fraco e distante, embora não desse
menos arrepios na espinha. Depois tudo silenciou, a não ser pelo som do vento
nas árvores.
- O que acham que foi isso? - perguntou Pippin finalmente, tentando dar um tom tranqüilo
à sua voz, que apesar disso estava meio
trêmula. - Se foi um pássaro, este
eu nunca ouvi no Condado antes.
- Não foi pássaro nem animal - disse Frodo. - Foi um chamado ou sinal - havia palavras
naquele grito, embora eu não tenha conseguido entendê-las. Mas nenhum hobbit
tem uma voz assim.
Não se falou mais nada sobre o assunto. Estavam todos pensando nos Cavaleiros, mas
ninguém falava neles. Agora relutavam, em partir e em ficar; mas mais cedo ou
mais tarde teriam de atravessar o campo aberto até a balsa, e era melhor ir mais cedo e
durante o dia. Em poucos minutos tinham colocado as mochilas nos ombros e
seguiam novamente.
Logo a floresta terminou de modo abrupto. Uma região ampla coberta por gramíneas se
estendia à frente deles. Agora percebiam que, de fato, tinham ido muito para
o sul. Adiante, sobre as planícies, visualizavam a colina baixa de Buqueburgo do outro
lado do Rio, mas agora ela estava à esquerda. Saindo cuidadosamente da borda
da floresta, começaram a atravessar o espaço aberto o mais rápido possível.
No início sentiram receio por estarem longe do abrigo da floresta. O lugar onde tinham
feito o desjejum já ficara muito para trás. Frodo tinha expectativas de ver
a pequena figura distante de um cavaleiro sobre as colinas, agora escuras contra o céu;
mas não havia nem sinal deles.
O sol, que afundava nas colinas atrás deles,
brilhava novamente, fugindo das nuvens que se desfaziam. O medo os abandonou, embora
ainda se sentissem inquietos. Mas rapidamente o terreno foi ficando menos intratável
e írregular. Logo entraram em campos e prados bem tratados: havia cercas-vivas, portões e
valas para drenagem. Tudo parecia quieto e pacífico, apenas um canto comum
do Condado. A cada passo sentiam-se mais alegres. A linha do Rio se aproximava, e os
Cavaleiros Negros começaram a parecer fantasmas da floresta deixada para trás.
Passaram ao longo da borda de uma grande plantação de nabos, e depararam com um portão
maciço, além do qual se estendia uma alameda batida entre duas cercas-vivas
baixas e bem podadas, indo em direção a um arvoredo. Pippin parou.
- Conheço estes campos e este portão! - disse ele. - É Glebafava, a terra do velho
Magote. A fazenda dele fica ali naquelas árvores.
#95
- É problema atrás de problema! - disse Frodo, que parecia quase tão alarmado como se
Pippin tivesse dito que a trilha conduzia à caverna de um dragão. Os outros
olharam surpresos.
- Qual é o problema com o velho Magote? - perguntou Pippin. - Ele tem amizade com todos
os Brandebuques. É claro que é o terror dos ínvasores, e cria cachorros ferozes
- mas também, as pessoas aqui estão perto da fronteira, e devem se precaver.
- Eu sei - disse Frodo. - Mas mesmo assim - acrescentou ele com um sorriso envergonhado tenho pavor dele e dos cachorros. Desviei desta fazenda por anos a fio.
Ele me pegou várias vezes invadindo o lugar, atrás de cogumelos, quando era um rapazola
na Sede do Brandevin. Na última vez me bateu e me levou até os cachorros.
"Vejam, meninos", disse ele, - da próxima vez que esse pequeno verme botar os pés nas
minhas terras, vocês podem devorá-lo. Agora levem-no para fora!" Eles me perseguiram
por todo o caminho até a balsa. Nunca me livrei do medo - mas me atrevo a dizer que os
animais sabiam o que estavam fazendo, e não teriam me atacado de verdade.
Pippin riu. - Bem, já é hora de fazerem as pazes. Principalmente se você está de volta
para morar na Terra dos Buques.
O velho Magote é um sujeito de bem, se você deixar os cogumelos em paz. Vamos entrar pela
alameda, e então não estaremos invadindo. Se o encontrarmos, eu falo com ele. É amigo de
Merry; houve uma época em

que costumávamos vir muito aqui juntos.
Foram ao longo da alameda, até avistarem os telhados de sapé de uma grande casa e de
outros barracões da fazenda, que começavam a aparecer em meio as árvores. Os
Magotes e os Poçapés de Tronco, como a maioria dos habitantes do Pântano, moravam em
casas; esta casa era de construção sólida, feita de tijolos, e cercada por um
grande muro em toda a volta, Um amplo portão de madeira se abria para a alameda.
De repente, conforme se aproximavam, latidos estrondosos irromperam, seguidos por uma voz
alta que gritava: - Garra! Presa! Lobo! Venham, meninos!
Frodo e Sam ficaram como estátuas, mas Pippin avançou mais alguns
passos.
O portão se abriu e três cachorros enormes saíram, disparando pela alameda em direção
aos viajantes, latindo ferozmente. Não tomaram conhecimento de Pippin, mas Sam se
encolheu contra a parede, enquanto dois cachorros que mais pareciam lobos o farejavam
desconfiados, e rosnavam quando se movia. O maior e mais feroz dos três parou na frente
de Frodo, rosnando e com os pêlos em pé.
Através do portão vinha agora um hobbit corpulento, de rosto redondo evermelho.
- Olá, Olá. E quem são vocês e o que querem? - perguntou ele.
#96
- Boa tarde, Sr. Magote - disse Pippin.
O fazendeiro olhou-o de perto. - Ora, ora, vejam só! Mestre Pippín ou melhor, o Sr.
Peregrin Túk - gritou ele, e sua expressão zangada se abriu num sorriso. - Faz
muito tempo que não o vejo por essas bandas. Sorte sua que o reconheci. Já ia soltar meu
cachorro em cima dos forasteiros. Hoje estão acontecendo coisas estranhas.
É claro que às vezes pegamos um pessoal esquisito vagando por aqui. É muito perto do Rio
- disse ele, balançando a cabeça. - Mas esse sujeito é o mais esquisito
que já vi. Ele não vai atravessar minhas terras e depois escapar de novo, não se eu puder
impedi-lo.
- De que sujeito está falando? - perguntou Pippin.
- Então vocês não viram? - disse o fazendeiro. - Ele subiu a alameda em direção à estrada
agora há pouco. Era um camarada estranho, fazendo perguntas estranhas.
Mas é melhor entrarem. Assim poderemos ficar mais bem acomodados e contar as
novidades. Tenho um gole de boa cerveja na tdega, se o senhor e seus amigos quiserem,
Sr. Túk.
Parecia certo que o fazendeiro falaria mais, se lhe permitissem fazer ;so em seu próprio
passo e maneira, de modo que todos aceitaram o
convite.
- E os cachorros? - perguntou Frodo ansioso.
O fazendeiro riu. - Não vão fazer mal nenhum, a não ser que eu ordene. Aqui, Garra!
Presa! Quietos - gritou ele. - Quieto, Lobo! - Para o
alívio de Frodo e Sam, os cachorros
foram embora e deixaram-nos passar.
Pippin apresentou os outros dois ao fazendeiro
. - Este é o Sr. Frodo Bolseiro - disse ele. - Pode não se lembrar, mas ele
morou na Sede do Branvin. - Ao escutar o
nome Bolseiro, o fazendeiro ficou surpreso, e olhou Frodo com olhos atentos, Por um
momento, Frodo pensou que a lembrança ; cogumelos roubados tinha despertado,
e
que os cachorros receberiam ordem de expulsá-lo. Mas Magote pegou-o pelo braço.
- Ora, ora, mas isto não é o mais esquisito de tudo - exclamou ele. Sr. Bolseiro, não é?
Entre! Precisamos ter uma
conversa.
Entraram na cozinha do fazendeiro, e sentaram-se perto da grande lareira. A Sra. Magote
trouxe cerveja numa jarra enorme, enchendo quatro
canecas grandes. Era de boa qualidade,
e Pippin se sentiu mais que recompensado por ter perdido a chance de ir ao Perca Dourada.
Sam bebeu sua -ja desconfiado. Sempre desconfiava de habitantes de outras

partes do Condado , e também não estava disposto a ficar logo amigo de alguém que
tivesse batido em seu patrão, não importava há quanto tempo.
Depois de falar um pouco sobre o tempo e sobre as perspectivas da
lavoura (que não eram piores do que o normal), o fazendeiro Magote
abaixou sua caneca, olhando para cada um deles.
- Agora, Sr. Peregrin - disse ele. - De onde estão vindo, e para onde vão? Estavam vindo
me visitar? Porque, se for isto, passaram pelo meu portão sem que eu os
tivesse visto.
#97
- Bem... não - respondeu Pippin. - Para falar a verdade, já que adivinhou, entramos pela
alameda do outro lado: viemos pelas plantações, mas foi por acaso. Nós nos
perdemos na floresta lá atrás, perto da Vila do Bosque, tentando cortar caminho até a
balsa.
- Se tinham pressa, a estrada seria melhor - disse o fazendeiro. - Mas eu não estava
preocupado com isso. Dou-lhe permissão para passar pelas minhas terras se desejar,
Sr. Peregrin. E ao senhor também, Sr. Bolseiro mas aposto que ainda gosta de cogumelos. Ele riu. - Sim, reconheci o nome. Lembro-me do tempo em que o jovem Frodo
Bolseiro era um dos piores fedelhos da Terra dos Buques. Mas eu não estava pensando nos
cogumelos. Tinha acabado de ouvir o nome Bolseiro quando apareceram.
O que acham que esse sujeito esquisito me Perguntou?
Todos esperavam ansiosamente que ele continuasse. - Bem - continuou o fazendeiro,
chegando ao ponto com um prazer vagaroso. - Ele veio montado num grande cavalo
preto pelo portão, que por acaso estava aberto, e chegou até minha porta. Era todo preto,
também, com uma capa e um capuz, como se não quisesse ser reconhecido.
"Ora, que diabos ele pode estar querendo aqui no Condado?", pensei comigo. Não
encontramos muitas pessoas grandes na fronteira; e de qualquer jeito nunca ouvi falar
de alguém semelhante a esse sujeito preto.
- "Bom dia para o senhor!", digo eu, indo até ele. "Esta alameda não leva a lugar nenhum,
e aonde quer que esteja indo, o melhor caminho é pela estrada." Não gostei
da aparência dele; e quando o Garra saiu, começou a farejar e soltou um ganido, como se
tivesse levado uma ferroada: depois pôs o rabo entre as pernas e saiu correndo
como um raio, uivando, O sujeito preto ficou parado, imóvel,
"Venho de longe", disse ele, devagar e dum jeito seco, apontando lá para o oeste, por
cima das minhas plantações, vejam só! "Viu Bolseiro por aí?", perguntou ele com uma voz estranha, curvando-se sobre mim,
Não pude ver o rosto, totalmente coberto pelo capuz, e senti um arrepio na espinha, Mas
não consegui entender
porque ele vinha vindo pela minha alameda desse jeito atrevido.
- "Vá embora!-, eu disse. "Aqui não tem nenhum Bolseiro. Está na parte errada do Condado.
É melhor voltar para o oeste, para aVila dos
Hobbits.
- mas desta vez vá pela estrada."
- "Bolseiro, partiu", respondeu ele num sussurro. "Ele está chegando. Não está longe.
Quero encontrá-lo. Pode me avisar se ele passar por aqui? Voltarei com ouro."
- "Não, não vai voltar", eu disse. "Vai voltar para o lugar de onde veio, rapidinho. Doulhe um minuto antes de chamar meus cachorros."
#98
- Ele soltou uma espécie de silvo. Poderia ser uma risada, e poderia não ser. Daí meteu
as esporas no seu cavalo grande, que avançou sobre mim, e eu pulei de lado
bem na hora. Chamei os cachorros, mas ele fez meiavolta, e cavalgou através do portão e
pela alameda em direção à estrada, rápido como um raio. Que acham disso?
Frodo ficou imóvel por um momento, olhando o fogo, mas só pensava em
como conseguiriam chegar até a balsa. - Não sei o que pensar - disse ele finalmente.

- Então vou dizer o que penso - disse Magote, - O senhor nunca
deveria ter se
misturado com gente da Vila dos Hobbits, Sr. Frodo.
O pessoal lá é esquisito.
- Sam se mexeu na cadeira, e lançou para o fazendeiro um olhar nada amigável. - Mas o
senhor sempre foi um menino descuidado. Quando soube que tinha deixado os Brandebuques
para morar com o Sr. Bilbo, disse que iria encontrar problemas. Ouça o que digo, tudo
isso vem das atividades estranhas do Sr. Bilbo.
O dinheiro dele foi conseguido de um modo estranho em lugares distantes, dizem por aí.
Será que
alguém não está querendo saber o que foi feito do ouro e das jóias que ele enterrou na
colina da
Vila dos Hobbits, como ouvi dizer?
Frodo não dizia nada: a perspicácia das conjecturas do fazendeiro era bastante
desconcertante.
- Bem, Sr. Frodo - continuou Magote -, folgo em saber que o senhor tenha tido o juizo de
voltar para a Terra dos Buques. Meu conselho é o seguinte: fique aqui!
E não se misture com esse pessoal de fora. Terá amigos nestas partes. Se algum desses
sujeitos pretos vier atrás do senhor de novo, eu cuido deles. Direi que está
morto, ou que deixou o Condado, ou qualquer coisa que desejar. E não estarei mentindo,
pois parece que é do velho Sr. Bilbo que eles querem notícias.
- Talvez tenha razão - disse Frodo, evitando o olhar do fazendeiro e olhando para o fogo.
Magote olhou para ele pensativo. - Bem, vejo que tem suas próprias idéias - disse ele. Está na cara que não foi nenhum acaso que trouxe o senhor e aquele cavaleiro
aqui na mesma tarde; e pode ser que minhas novidades não tenham sido tão novidade assim
para o senhor, no final das contas. Não estou pedindo que me conte nada que
deseje guardar para si; mas vejo que está metido em algum tipo de problema. Talvez esteja
achando que não vai ser tão fácil chegar até a balsa sem ser capturado...
- Estava pensando nisso - disse Frodo. - Mas temos que tentar chegar até lá; e isso não
se faz sentando e pensando. Então, receio que devemos ir. Somos imensamente
gratos por sua gentileza! Tive pavor do senhor e de seus cachorros por mais de trinta
anos, Sr. Magote, apesar de o senhor poder rir do que digo. É uma pena. Perdi
um grande amigo. E agora sinto em partir tão depressa. Mas voltarei, quem sabe, um dia se tiver uma chance.
#99
- Será bem-vindo quando vier - disse Magote. - Mas agora tive uma idéia. Já está quase no
fim do dia, e nós vamos cear, pois nos deitamos logo depois do sol. Se
o senhor e o Sr. Peregrin e os outros pudessem ficar e comer alguma coisa conosco,
ficaríamos satisfeitos.
- Nós também ficaríamos - disse Frodo. - Mas temo que devamos partir imediatamente. Mesmo
assim estará escuro antes de chegarmos à balsa.
- Ah! mas esperem um minuto! Eu ia dizer: depois de uma pequena
ceia, eu pego uma carroça e levo vocês todos até a balsa. Isso vai poupar uma boa
caminhada, e também pode poupá-los de problemas de outro tipo. Frodo agora aceitou
o convite agradecido, para o alivio de Pippin e
Sam- o sol já estava atrás das colinas do oeste, e a luz ia enfraquecendo. Dois dos
filhos de Magote e as três filhas entraram, e uma ceia generosa foi posta sobre
a grande mesa. A cozinha foi iluminada com velas e o fogo foi reativado. A Sra. Magote
entrava e saía, alvoroçada.
Um ou dois hobbits que também eram da casa apareceram.
Logo catorze pessoas se sentaram para comer. Havia cerveja em quantidade, e um grande
prato de cogumelos com bacon foi servido, além de muitos outros produtos da
própria fazenda. Os cachorros estavam deitados ao lado do fogo, mordendo restos de carne
e roendo ossos.
Quando terminaram, o fazendeiro e seus filhos foram com uma lamparina aprontar a carroça.
Estava escuro na varanda quando os convidados saíram, Jogaram suas mochilas
na carroça e
subiram. O fazendeiro se sentou no lugar do condutor e chicoteou os dois
fortes pôneis. Sua esposa ficou parada na luz que vinha da porta aberta.

- Tome cuidado, Magote! - disse ela. - Não vá di
Scutir com nenhum estranho, e volte
direto para casa!
- Está bem! - disse ele, conduzindo a carroça para fora do portão. Agora não havia nem
sinal de vento soprando; a noite estava tranqüila e quieta, o ar levemente
frio. Seguiram sem luzes e devagar. Depois de uma ou duas milhas, a alameda terminou,
cruzando
uma vala profunda, e subindo uma ladeira curta até a estrada,
que ficava num nível mais alto que a propriedade.
Magote desceu e deu uma boa olhada dos dois lados, para o norte e para o sul, mas não se
via nada na escuridão, e nenhum som cortava o ar parado.
Tênues manchas
de neblina pairavam sobre as valas, e avançavam sobre as plantações.
- A neblina vai ficar densa, mas não vou acender minhas lamparinas até que esteja
voltando para casa. Nesta noite, poderemos ouvir qualquer coisa na estrada muito
antes de encontrá-la.
A alameda de Magote ficava a cinco milhas ou mais da balsa. Os hobbits se agasalharam mas
ficaram de ouvidos bem atentos a qualquer som
#100
mais alto que o rangido das rodas e o lento clope-clope dos cascos dos pôneis. Para
Frodo, a carroça parecia mais lenta que um caramujo. Ao lado dele, Pippin cabeceava
de sono; mas Sam olhava atentamente em direção à neblina que subia.
Finalmente chegaram à entrada do caminho que conduzia à balsa. Ali havia como marco dois
postes altos e brancos que logo assomaram à direita deles. Magote puxou
as rédeas e a carroça rangeu uma última vez. Bem na hora em que estavam descarregando as
mochilas e descendo, ouviram o que todos tinham receado: cascos na estrada
adiante. O som vinha em direção a eles.
Magote pulou para fora e ficou segurando as cabeças dos pôneis, tentando enxergar à
frente na escuridão.
O cavaleiro se aproximava, clipe-clope, clipe-clope. O ruído
dos cascos parecia alto naquele ar parado, em meio ao nevoeiro.
- É melhor se esconder, Sr. Frodo - disse Sam ansioso. - Entre na carroça e se cubra com
os cobertores, e nós vamos enviar esse cavaleiro para o lugar de onde nunca
deveria ter saído! - Sam desceu e ficou ao lado do fazendeiro. Os Cavaleiros Negros só se
aproximariam da carroça se passassem por cima dele.
Clope-clope, clope-clope. O cavaleiro já estava quase chegando até eles.
- Alô, quem vem aí? - chamou Magote.
Os cascos que avançavam pararam imediatamente. Eles
tiveram a impressão de estar enxergando uma forma escura envolta por uma capa na névoa,
um ou dois metros adiante.
- Agora! - disse o fazendeiro, jogando as rédeas para Sam e avançando com passos largos.
- Não se aproxime nem mais um passo!
O que você quer, e para onde vai?
- Estou procurando o Sr. Bolseiro. O senhor o viu? - disse uma voz abafada - mas a voz
era de Merry Brandebuque. Uma lamparina escura foi descoberta, e sua luz caiu
sobre o rosto atônito do fazendeiro.
- Sr. Merry! - gritou ele.
- Sim, claro! Quem pensou que era? - disse Merry se aproximando, e saindo da névoa que o
envolvia.
O receio de todos desvaneceu, e o tamanho de Merry pareceu diminuir
até chegar à estatura de um hobbit comum. Estava montando um pônei, e um cachecol
envolvia seu pescoço, cobrindo até acima do queixo, como proteção contra a neblina.
Frodo pulou da carroça para cumprimentá-lo.
- Então, finalmente chegaram! - disse Merry. - Estava começando a me perguntar
se chegariam ainda hoje, e já estava voltando
para cear. Quando a neblina aumentou, atravessei a balsa e cavalguei em direção a Tronco
para ver se não tinham caído em nenhum fosso. Mas estou pasmo de ver por
onde vieram. Onde os encontrou, Sr. Magote? Na lagoa dos patos?

- Não, peguei-os invadindo minhas terras - disse o fazendeiro. - E quase lhes soltei os
cachorros em cima; mas eles vão contar toda a história, sem dúvida. Agora,
se me desculpam, Sr. Merry, Sr. Frodo e todos, é melhor eu voltar para casa. A Sra.
Magote fica aflita depois que escurece.
Ele recuou a carroça até a alameda e a virou. - Bem, boa noite a todos!
- disse ele. - Tivemos um dia esquisito, sem dúvida. Mas bem está o que bem acaba; embora
talvez não devamos dizer isto antes de chegar a nossas próprias casas.
Não posso negar que ficarei feliz ao chegar. - Acendeu as lamparinas, e subiu na carroça.
De repente tirou uma grande cesta de baixo de seu assento. - Estava quase
esquecendo - disse ele. - A Sra. Magote arrumou isto para o Sr. Bolseiro, com seus
cumprimentos. - Entregou a cesta e partiu, seguido por um coro de "obrigados",
que se misturava a várias saudações de "boa-noite".
Ficaram olhando os pálidos anéis de luz ao redor das lamparinas, que iam desaparecendo
dentro da neblina da noite. De repente, Frodo riu: da cesta coberta que segurava,
subia o aroma de cogumelos.

CAPíTULO V
CONSPIRAÇÃO DESMASCARADA

- Agora é melhor irmos para casa também - disse Merry. - Essa história está meio
esquisita, mas vai ter de esperar até chegarmos lá.
Desceram a alameda da balsa, que era reta e bem-cuidada, ladeada por grandes pedras
caiadas. Cerca de cem metros dali, ficava a margem do rio, onde havia um largo
ancoradouro de madeira. Uma balsa grande e rasa estava atracada. Os tocos em que eram
amarradas as embarcações, próximos à beira da água, brilhavam na luz de duas
lamparinas suspensas em postes altos. Atrás deles a neblina, subindo do solo plano, já
cobria as cercas-vivas; mas a água à frente era escura, com apenas alguns
chumaços de névoa que se enrolavam como vapor por entre os juncos na margem. Parecia
haver menos neblina no outro lado.
Merry conduziu o pônei até a balsa por um passadiço, e os outros o seguiram. Então, Merry
empurrou a balsa com uma vara comprida, afastando-a vagarosamente do ancoradouro.
O Brandevin fluía lento e largo diante deles. A margem oposta era íngreme, e por ela
subia uma trilha sinuosa que começava no outro ancoradouro. Ali havia luzes
piscando. Atrás se erguia a Colina Buque, onde brilhavam muitas janelas redondas, verdes
e amarelas, por entre tufos perdidos de neblina. Eram as janelas da Sede
do Brandevin, antiga residência dos Brandebuques.
Muito tempo atrás, Gorbendad Velhobuque, chefe da família Velhobuque, uma das pessoas
mais velhas do Pântano e mesmo do Condado, tinha atravessado o rio, que era
a fronteira original do lado leste. Ele construiu (e escavou) a Sede do Brandevin,
mudando seu nome para Brandebuque, e por ali ficou, vindo a se tornar senhor do
que era virtualmente um país independente. A família cresceu mais e mais, e depois de sua
época continuou crescendo, e a Sede do Brandevin passou a ocupar toda a
parte baixa da colina, com três grandes portas de entrada, muitas portas laterais e cerca
de cem janelas. Os Brandebuques, e sua numerosa prole, começaram a fazer
tocas, e mais tarde casas, por todo o lugar. Esta foi a origem da Terra dos Buques, uma
faixa densamente habitada entre o rio e a Floresta Velha, um tipo de colônia

do Condado. Sua aldeia principal era Buqueburgo, que se amontoava nas encostas e ladeiras
atrás da Sede do Brandevin.
O povo do Pântano tinha boas relações com os moradores da Terra dos Buques, e a
autoridade do Senhor da Sede (como era chamado o chefe da família Brandebuque) ainda
era reconhecida pelos fazendeiros da região
#104
entre Tronco e Juncal. Mas a maioria das pessoas do velho Condado achava os moradores da
Terra dos Buques peculiares, meio estrangeiros, por assim dizer. Embora,
na realidade, eles não fossem muito diferentes dos outros hobbits das quatro Quartas. A
não ser por uma coisa: gostavam de barcos e alguns sabiam nadar.
Originalmente, essa terra não era protegida do lado leste, mas ali providenciaram uma
cerca-viva: a Sebe Alta. Plantada há muitas gerações, estava agora alta e espessa,
pois era constantemente cuidada. Estendia-se desde a Ponte do Brandevin, descrevendo um
grande arco que se afastava do rio, até Fim-da-Sebe (onde corria o
Voltavime
vindo da floresta para desaguar no Brandevin): eram cerca de vinte milhas de ponta a
ponta. Mas é claro que a proteção não era completa. A floresta se aproximava
da cerca em muitos pontos. Os moradores da Terra dos Buques mantinham as portas trancadas
depois de escurecer, e isso também não era comum no Condado.
A balsa ia lentamente através da água. O porto da Terra dos Buques se aproximou, Sam era
o único do grupo que nunca tinha estado do outro
lado do rio. Foi tomado
por um sentimento estranho, ao observar a corrente que borbulhava ao passar: sua vida
antiga lá atrás, envolta pela neblina; à sua frente, sombrias aventuras. Coçou
a cabeça, e por um momento desejou que o Sr. Frodo pudesse ter continuado a viver
tranqüilamente em Bolsão.
Os quatro hobbits desceram da balsa. Merry estava amarrando a balsa, e Pippin já ia
conduzindo o pônei pela trilha, quando Sam (que tinha ficado olhando para trás,
como a dizer adeus ao Condado) disse num suspiro rouco:
- Olhe para trás, Sr. Frodo! Vê alguma coisa?
No ancoradouro distante, sob as luzes longínquas, conseguiam apenas adivinhar uma figura:
parecia um escuro fardo preto que tinha ficado para trás. Mas quando olharam
melhor, parecia que a figura se movia de um lado para o outro, como se examinasse no
chão. Depois foi se arrastando, se agachando de volta para a escuridão além
das lamparinas.
- Que raios pode ser aquilo? - exclamou Merry.
- Alguma coisa que está nos seguindo - disse Frodo. - Mas não pergunte mais nada agora!
Vamos sair daqui imediatamente! - Apressaram-se pela trilha até o topo da
margem, mas quando olharam para trás novamente, o outro ancoradouro estava coberto pela
neblina, e não se podia ver nada.
- Ainda bem que vocês não mantêm barcos na margem oeste! - disse Frodo. - Cavalos
conseguem atravessar este rio?
- Poderiam avançar umas vinte milhas ao norte, até a Ponte do Brandevín - ou poderiam
nadar - respondeu Merry. - Embora eu nunca tenha ouvido falar de cavalos cruzando
este rio a nado. Mas o que os cavalos têm a ver com isso?
#105
- Depois eu lhe conto, Vamos entrar em casa e assim poderemos conversar.
- Tudo bem! Você e Pippin sabem o caminho; então vou corri o ponei na frente, dizer a
Fatty Bolger que vocês estão chegando. Vamos preparar a ceia e as outras coisas.
- já ceamos mais cedo, corm o Sr. Magote - disse Frodo, - Mas poderíamos cear de novo.
- Então, vamos lá! Me dê essa cesta! - disse Merry, cavalgando para dentro da escuridão.
O Brandevin ficava a uma certa distância da nova casa de Frodo em Cricôncavo. Passaram
pela Colina Buque e a Sede do Brandevin à sua esquerda, e nos arrabaldes de

Buqueburgo pegaram a estrada principal da Terra dos Buques que ia da Ponte em direção ao
Sul. Depois de caminharem
meia milha nessa estrada rumo ao norte, encontraram
uma alameda que se abria à direita. Seguiram por ela algumas milhas, subindo e descendo
em direção ao campo.
Finalmente depararam com uma cerca-viva e um portão estreito. Na escuridão, não se via
nada da casa, que ficava afastada da alameda, no meio de um amplo círculo
coberto de grama e circundado por uma faixa de árvores baixas no interior da cerca
externa. Frodo tinha escolhido esse lugar porque ficava num ponto do campo onde
não passava muita gente, e não havia outras habitações por perto, Podia-se entrar e sair
sem ser notado. A casa tinha sido construída muito tempo atrás pelos Brandebuques,
para o uso de convidados, ou de membros da família que desejassem escapar da vida agitada
da Sede do Brandevin por uns tempos. Era antiga e com jeito de casa de
campo, o mais parecida possível com uma toca hobbit: comprida e baixa, sem pavimentos
superiores; e tinha um telhado de turfa, janelas redondas e uma grande porta,
também redonda.
Andando pelo caminho verde que conduzia do portão até a casa, não se podia ver nenhuma
luz; as janelas estavam escuras e fechadas. Frodo bateu na porta e Fatty Bolger
abriu. Uma luz amistosa projetou-se para fora. Entraram rápido e se trancaram por dentro
junto com a luz. Estavam agora numa sala ampla, com portas dos dois lados;
à frente, um corredor conduzia ao centro da casa.
- Bem, o que acha? - perguntou Merry, vindo pelo corredor. - Nesse curto espaço de tempo,
fizemos o possível para que a casa parecesse um lar. Afinal de contas,
Fatty e eu só chegamos aqui com a última carroça de bagagem ontem.
Frodo olhou em volta. A aparência era de um lar. Muitas de suas coisas favoritas - ou das
coisas favoritas de Bilbo (que nesse novo ambiente faziam
#106
lembrar muito dele) - estavam arrumadas do modo mais semelhante possível à sua antiga
disposição em Bolsão. Era um lugar agradável, confortável, acolhedor; e Frodo
se viu desejando que realmente estivesse chegando para se acomodar num retiro tranqüilo.
Parecia-lhe injusto fazer com que os amigos tivessem todo esse trabalho;
e ele começou de novo a imaginar como poderia dizer que devia partir tão breve, na
verdade, imediatamente. Mas isso teria de ser feito naquela mesma noite, antes
de irem dormir.
- Está encantador! - disse ele com esforço. - Mal percebo que me mudei.
Os viajantes penduraram suas capas, e empilharam as mochilas no chão. Merry os conduziu
pelo corredor e escancarou a última porta. A luz do fogo, e uma onda de vapor,
vinham lá de dentro.
- Um banho! - gritou Pippin. - ó magnífico Meriadoc!
- Em que ordem vamos tomar banho? - perguntou Frodo. - Mais velhos primeiro, ou mais
rápidos primeiro? De qualquer modo, você vai ficar por último, Mestre Peregrin.
- Deixem que eu arranjo as coisas de um modo melhor! - disse Merry.
- Não podemos começar a vida aqui em Cricôncavo com uma discussão sobre banhos. Naquela
sala, há três banheiras e um caldeirão cheio de água fervendo. Também há
toalhas, tapetes e sabão. Entrem e sejam rápidos!
Merry e Fatty entraram na cozinha do outro lado do corredor, e se ocuparam com os
preparativos finais para a ceia. Pedaços de canções concorrentes vinham do banheiro,
misturados com o ruído dos hobbits espirrando água para todo lado. De repente a voz de
Pippin ficou mais alta que as outras, cantando uma das canções de banho favoritas
de Bilbo.
Cantemos o banho do fim do dia que da sujeira nos alivia!
Tonto é quem cantar não tente.- Ah! coisa nobre é Água Quente.
Doce é o som da chuva que cai, e do riacho que saltando vai;
melhor que chuva ou riacho ondulante é Água Quente e vaporizante.
Agua,fria podemos mandar
goela abaixo e nos alegrar,Os direitos sobre essa obra são protegidos pelas leis internacionais de Copyright. Não pode ser vendido, imprimido nem

melhor é Cerveja no copo da gente e lombo abaixo Água bem Quente.
#107
Bela é a Água do alto a saltar
emfonte limpa suspensa no ar,mas nunca,fonte, tão doce és comoÁgua Quente debaixo dos
pés.
um grito de oooh! Houve um barulho estrondoso de água espirrando, e
como se Frodo estivesse parando um cavalo. A banheira de Pippin mais parecia
uma fonte com água jorrando para o alto.
Merry apareceu na porta:
- Que tal uma ceia e cerveja no gogó? - chamou ele.
Frodo saiu, secando o cabelo.
- Tem tanta água no ar que vou terminar isto na cozinha - disse ele.
- Caramba! - disse Merry. O chão de pedra estava uma poça. -Vai ter de passar um esfregão
em tudo antes de tocar na comida, Peregrin - disse ele. - Rápido! - Ou
não esperaremos você.
Cearam na cozinha, numa mesa perto do fogo.
- Suponho que não vão querer repetir de novo? - disse Fredegar, sem muitas
esperanças.
-Claro que vamos! - gritou Píppin.
- Os cogumelos são meus! - disse Frodo. - Dados a mim pela Sra. Magote, a rainha das
mulheres de fazendeiros. Tire as mãos gulosas daí, que eu sirvo.
Os hobbits têm uma paixão por cogumelos, que ultrapassa mesmo o desejo mais voraz de uma
pessoa grande. Um fato que explica em parte as longas expedições do jovem
Frodo às renomadas plantações do Pântano, e a ira do injuriado Magote. Nesta ocasião,
havia o suficiente para todos, mesmo dentro dos padrões dos hobbits. Também
havia muitas outras coisas, e, quando terminaram, até mesmo Fatty Bolger soltou um
suspiro de satisfação. Empurraram a mesa e aproximaram as cadeiras do fogo.
- Arrumamos tudo depois - disse Merry. - Agora, contem-me tudo! Suponho que estiveram
metidos em aventuras, o que não foi justo sem minha presença. Quero um relatório
completo; e acima de tudo quero saber qual foi o problema com o velho Magote, e por que
ele falou comigo daquele jeito. Até parecia que estava com medo, se é que
isto é possível.
- Todos nós tivemos medo - disse Pippin, depois de uma pausa, durante a qual Frodo ficou
olhando para o fogo, sem dizer nada. - Você também teria, se tivesse Cavaleiros
Negros no seu encalço por dois dias.
- E que são eles?
- Figuras negras montando cavalos negros - respondeu Pippín. - Se Frodo não quiser falar,
eu lhe conto a história toda desde o começo. - Fez então um relatório completo
da viagem, desde que deixaram Vila dos Hobbits. Sam fez vários sinais afirmativos com a
cabeça, e soltou exclamações apoiando Pippin. Frodo permanecia em silêncio.
#108
- Eu pensaria que estão inventando tudo isso - disse Merry -, se não tivesse visto aquela
figura negra no ancoradouro - e ouvido o tom estranho na voz de Magote.
O que acha de tudo isso, Frodo?
- O primo Frodo tem estado muito fechado - disse Pippin. - Mas chegou a hora de se abrir.
Até agora, não nos foi oferecida nenhuma informação, a não ser a suposição
de Magote: de que isso tem a ver com o tesouro do velho Bilbo.
- Aquilo foi só suposição - disse Frodo de repente. - Magote não sabe de nada.
- O velho Magote é um sujeito astuto
- disse Merry. - Há muita coisa escondida que aquele rosto redondo não deixa transparecer
quando fala. Ouvi dizer que numa época costumava ir à Floresta Velha, e
ele tem a reputação de conhecer muitas coisas estranhas. Mas pelo menos, Frodo, você pode
nos dizer se a suposição dele é ou não infundada.

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
- Eu acho - respondeu Frodo devagar - que a suposição tem fundamento, pelo menos até onde
chega. Existe uma ligação com as antigas aventuras de Bilbo, e os Cavaleiros
estão empreendendo uma busca, ou talvez deva dizer perseguição, tentando pôr as mãos em
cima dele, ou de mim. Também acho, se querem saber, que isto não é nenhuma
brincadeira; e que não estou a salvo nem aqui e nem em qualquer-outro lugar.
- Frodo olhou à sua volta,para as janelas e paredes, como receando que de repente tudo
desabasse. Os outros olhavam-no em silêncio, também trocando olhares significativos entre
si.
- Acho que agora ele vai falar - cochichou Pippin para Merry. Merry concordou, balançando
a cabeça.
- Bem! - disse Frodo finalmente, endireitando-se na cadeira, como se tivesse tomado uma
decisão. - Não posso esconder isto por mais tempo. Tenho uma coisa para dizer
a todos vocês. Mas não sei por onde começar.
- Acho que posso ajudá-lo - disse Merry calmamente -, contando uma parte eu mesmo.
- Que quer dizer? - perguntou Frodo, olhando-o ansiosamente.
- Apenas isto, meu querido e velho Frodo: você está desolado, porque não sabe como dizer
adeus. Você pretendia,deixar o Condado, é claro. Mas o perigo lhe sobreveio
antes do que esperava, e agora está se decidindo a partir imediatamente. E não quer fazêlo. Sentimos muito por você.
Frodo abriu a boca, e a fechou novamente. Sua cara de surpresa era tão cÔmica que todos
riram. - Querido e velho Frodo! - disse Pippin. - Você realmente achou que
tinha jogado poeira em nossos olhos? Não foi cuidadoso ou esperto o suficiente para isso!
É óbvio que vem planejando partir e dizer adeus a tudo e a todos desde
abril. Nós o vimos constantemente resmungando: "Será que um dia verei aquele vale
novamente?", e coisas assim.
#109
E fingindo que começava a ficar sem dinheiro, e realmente vendendo seu adorado lar,
Bolsão, para aqueles Sacola-bolseiros. E todas aquelas conversas secretas com
Gandalf.
- Céus! - disse Frodo. - Pensei que tinha sido cuidadoso e esperto. Não sei o que Gandalf
diria. Então, todo o Condado está comentando a minha partida?
- Ah, não! - disse Merry. - Não se preocupe com isso. É claro que o segredo não vai durar
muito; mas no momento só é conhecido por nós, conspiradores, eu acho. Afinal
de contas, deve se lembrar que o conhecemos bem, e sempre estamos com você. Geralmente
conseguimos adivinhar o que está pensando. Eu também conhecia Bilbo.
Para falar a verdade, tenho ficado de olho em você desde que ele partiu. Achei que iria
atrás dele, mais cedo ou mais tarde, e ultimamente temos estado muito ansiosos. Tínhamos
pavor que nos pudesse passar a perna, e ir embora de repente sozinho, como
ele fez. Desde a primavera, estamos de olhos abertos, e fazendo muitos planos por nossa
própria conta. Você não vai escapar tão facilmente!
- Mas preciso ir - disse Frodo. - Isso não pode ser evitado, queridos amigos. É terrível
para todos nós, mas não adianta ficarem tentando me impedir. Já que adivinharam
tanta coisa, por favor me ajudem, e não me atrasem.
- Você não está entendendo - disse Pippin. - Você precisa ir - portanto nós precisamos ir
também. Merry e eu vamos com você. Sam é um sujeito excelente, e pularia
dentro da garganta de um dragão para salvá-lo, se não tropeçasse nos próprios pés; mas
você precisará de mais de um companheiro nessa aventura perigosa.
- Meus queridos e idolatrados hobbits! - disse Frodo, profundamente emocionado. - Não
posso permitir que façam isso. Tomei a decisão há muito tempo, também. Vocês
falam de perigos, mas não entendem. Isso não é nenhuma caça ao tesouro, nenhuma viagem de
lá-e-de-volta. Estou fugindo de um perigo mortal, em direção a outro perigo
mortal.
- Claro que entendemos - disse Merry firmemente. - É por isso que decidimos ir. Sabemos
que o Anel não é brincadeira; mas faremos o possível para ajudá-lo contra
o Inimigo.
- O Anel! - disse Frodo, agora completamente aturdido.

- Sim, o Anel - disse Merry. - Meu querido e velho hobbit, você não leva em consideração
a curiosidade dos amigos. Sei da existência do Anel há muitos anos - desde
antes de Bilbo partir, na verdade; mas já que ele obviamente considerava isso um segredo,
guardei para mim o que sabia, até que formamos nossa conspiração. É claro
que não conhecia Bilbo como conheço você; eu era muito jovem, e também ele era mais
cauteloso - mas não o suficiente. Se quiser saber como descobri, eu lhe conto.
#110
- Continue! - disse Frodo baixinho.
-A armadilha foram os Sacola-bolseiros, como já se poderia esperar. Um dia, um ano antes
da Festa, eu por acaso estava caminhando pela estrada, quando vi Bílbo mais
adiante, De repente, na distância, os S-Bs surgiram, vindo em nossa direção. Bilbo
diminuiu o passo, e então de súbito desapareceu. Fiquei tão assustado que não
tive capacidade de me esconder de um modo mais usual; mas entrei na cerca-viva e caminhei
ao longo do campo, do lado de dentro. Estava espiando a estrada, depois
que os S-Bs tinham passado, e olhando direto para Bilbo quando ele reapareceu. Pude ver o
reflexo de um objeto de ouro quando ele colocou alguma coisa de volta
no bolso da calça.
- Depois disso, mantive os olhos abertos - continuou Merry. - Na verdade, confesso que
espionei. Mas deve admitir que a coisa era muito intrigante, e eu era apenas
um adolescente. Devo ser o único no Condado, além de você, Frodo, que já leu o livro
secreto do velho camarada.
- Você leu o livro! - gritou Frodo. - Puxa vida! Então nada pode ser guardado a salvo?
- Não perfeitamente a salvo, eu acho - disse Merry. - Mas eu só dei uma olhada rápida, e
isso já foi dificil. Ele nunca deixava o livro jogado por aí. Fico imaginando
o que foi feito dele. Gostaria de dar mais uma olhada. Você está com ele, Frodo?
- Não, não estava em Bolsão. Bilbo deve tê-lo levado.
- Bem, como ia dizendo - continuou Merry -, guardei para mim o que sabia, até esta
primavera, quando as coisas ficaram sérias. Então formamos nossa conspiração;
e como também estávamos levando isso a sério, e falávamos a sério, não fomos escrupulosos
demais. Você é um osso duro de roer, e Gandalf é ainda pior. Mas se quiser
conhecer nosso investigador-chefe, posso apresentá-lo.
- Onde está ele? - perguntou Frodo olhando ao redor, como se esperasse que uma figura
mascarada e sinistra saísse de dentro do armário.
- Um passo à frente, Sam! - disse Merry, e Sam se levantou com o rosto vermelho até as
orelhas. -Aqui está nosso coletor de informações! E ele coletou muitas, posso
lhe garantir, antes de ser finalmente pego. Depois do que, posso dizer, pareceu julgar
que estava comprometido com sua palavra de honra, e simplesmente ficou mudo.
- Sam! - gritou Frodo, sentindo que a surpresa não poderia ser maior, e não podendo
decidir se estava zangado, aliviado, achando graça ou simplesmente fazendo papel
de bobo.
- Sim, senhor! - disse Sam. - Peço desculpas, senhor! Mas não quis lhe fazer mal, Sr.
Frodo, nem ao Sr. Gandalf, falando nisso. Ele é sensato, veja bem, e quando
o senhor disse ir sozinho, ele disse não! leve alguém em quem possa confiar.
#111
Mas isso não quer dizer que eu possa confiar em qualquer um disse Frodo.
Sam lançou-lhe um olhar triste.
- Tudo depende do que você deseja interrompeu MeTry. - Pode confiar em nós para ficarmos
juntos com voce nos bons e maus momentos
- até o mais amargo fim. E pode confiar também que guardaremos qualquer um de seus
segredos - melhor ainda do que você os guarda para si. Mas não pode confiar que
deixaremos que enfrente Problemas sozinho, e que vá embora sem dizer uma palavra. Somos
seus amigos, Frodo. De qualquer modo, é isto: sabemos a maior parte do que
Gandalf lhe disse. Sabemos muito sobre o Anel. Estamos com um medo terrível - mas iremos
ao seu lado; seguiremos você como cães.

- E, afinal de contas, senhor - acrescentou Sam -, o senhor deveria seguir o conselho dos
elfos. Gildor lhe disse que deveria levar pessoas que estivessem dispostas.
E nós estamos, isso não se pode negar.
- Eu não nego - disse Frodo olhando para Sam, que agora sorria. Não nego, mas nunca mais
vou acreditar que está dormindo, quer você ronque ou não. Vou dar-lhe um
chute forte para ter certeza.
- Bando de patifes enganadores! - disse ele, virando-se para os outros.
- Mas ainda bem que tenho vocês! - disse rindo, levantando-se e acenando os braços. Desisto. Vou seguir o conselho de Gildor. Se o perigo não fosse tão grande
dançaria de alegria. Mas mesmo assim, não consigo evitar a felicidade que sinto;
felicidade que há muito não sentia. Temia muito por esta noite.
- Bom! Está combinado! Três brindes para o Capitão Frodo e companhia! - gritaram eles,
dançando em volta de Frodo. Merry e Pippin começaram uma canção, que aparentemente
tinham aprontado para a ocasião. Foi feita seguindo o modelo da canção dos anóes que
lançou Bilbo em sua aventura muito tempo atrás, e ia na mesma melodia:
Adeus vamos dar à casa e ao lar! Pode chover e pode ventar,
Vamos embora antes da aurora, Mata e montanha atrás vão ficar.
A Valfenda vamos onde elfos achamos Em descampados e por entre ramos; Por trechos
desertos seguimos espertos,
O que vem depois nós não divisamos.
Na frente o inimigo, atrás o perigo. Dormindo ao relento, o céu por abrigo. Até que por
sina a dureza termina, Finda ajornada, cumprido o castigo.
#112
Vamos embora! Vamos embora! Vamos partir antes da aurora!
- Muito bem! - disse Frodo. - Mas neste caso há muito o que fazer antes de irmos dormir sob um teto, pelo menos por hoje.
- Oh! Aquilo era poesia! - disse Pippin. - Você realmente quer partir antes do dia raiar?
- Não sei - respondeu Frodo. - Tenho medo daqueles Cavaleiros Negros, e tenho certeza de
que não é seguro ficar num só lugar por muito tempo, principalmente num
lugar para onde se sabe que eu estava indo. Também, Gildor me aconselhou a não esperar.
Mas eu gostaria muito de ver
Gandalf. Pude perceber que até Gildor ficou perturbado
quando soube que Gandalf não tinha aparecido. Depende de duas coisas. Em quanto tempo os
Cavaleiros conseguiriam chegar a Buqueburgo? E em quanto tempo poderíamos
partir? Temos muitos preparativos a fazer.
- A resposta para a segunda pergunta - disse Merry - é que poderíamos partir dentro de
uma hora. Já preparei praticamente tudo. Há seis pÔneis num estábulo do outro
lado do campo; os mantimentos e equipamentos estão todos embalados, com a exceção de
roupas extras e da comida perecível.
- Parece que a conspiração foi muito eficiente - disse Frodo. - Mas e os Cavaleiros
Negros? Seria seguro esperar Gandalf mais um dia?
- Tudo isso depende do que você acha que os Cavaleiros fariam, se o encontrassem aqui respondeu Merry. - Eles poderiam já ter chegado até aqui, é claro, se não
tivessem parado no Portão Norte, onde a Cerca desce até a margem do rio, exatamente deste
lado da Ponte. Os guardas do portão não os deixariam entrar à noite, embora
eles pudessem forçar a entrada. Mesmo durante o dia, tentariam mantê-los fora daqui, eu
acho, pelo menos até conseguirem enviar uma mensagem para o Senhor da Sede
- pois não iriam gostar da aparência dos Cavaleiros, e certamente teriam medo deles. Mas,
é claro, a Terra dos Buques não pode resistir a um ataque determinado por
longo tempo. E é possível que, de manhã, até mesmo a um Cavaleiro Negro que subisse e
perguntasse pelo Sr. Bolseiro fosse permitido entrar. Muita gente sabe que
você está vindo morar em Cricôncavo.
Frodo ficou sentado por um tempo, pensando. - Já me decidi - disse ele finalmente. Parto amanhã, assim que o dia nascer. Mas não vou pela estrada: seria ainda
menos seguro do que esperar aqui. Se for através do Portão Norte, minha partida da Terra
dos Buques será imediatamente do conhecimento de todos, em vez de ser um

segredo por vários dias no mínimo, como deve acontecer. Além do mais, a Ponte e a Estrada
Leste perto da fronteira
#113
serão certamente vigiadas, quer algum Cavaleiro entre na Terra dos Buques quer não. Não
sabemos quantos são; mas há pelo menos dois, e possivelmente mais. A única
coisa a fazer é partir numa direção totalmente inesperada.
- Mas isso só pode significar que o caminho é o da Floresta Velha! disse Fredegar
horrorizado. - Não pode estar pensando em fazer isso. A Floresta é quase tão perigosa
quanto os Cavaleiros Negros.
- Nem tanto - disse Merry. - Parece uma atitude desesperada, mas acho que Frodo tem
razão. É o único jeito de partirmos sem sermos seguidos imediatamente. Com sorte,
poderemos conseguir uma boa vantagem.
- Mas vocês não vão ter sorte na Floresta Velha - objetou Fredegar. Ninguém tem sorte
ali. Vão se perder. As pessoas não entram lá.
- Entram sim! - disse Merry - Os Brandebuques entram - ocasionalmente, quando lhes dá na
telha. Temos uma entrada particular. Frodo entrou uma vez, há muito tempo.
Já estive lá várias vezes: geralmente de dia, é claro, quando as árvores estão com sono e
bastante tranqüilas.
- Bem, faça como achar melhor! - disse Fredegar. - Tenho mais medo da Floresta Velha do
que de qualquer outra coisa que conheço: as histórias que contam são um
pesadelo; mas meu voto conta pouco, pois não vou nessa viagem. Mesmo assim, fico feliz em
pensar que alguém vai ficar para trás, alguém que possa contar a Gandalf
o que fizeram, quando ele aparecer, como tenho certeza de que fará logo.
Apesar de gostar muito de Frodo, Fatty Bolger não tinha vontade de deixar o Condado, nem
de ver o que havia fora de lá. Sua família era da Quarta Leste, do Vau Budge,
nos Campos da Ponte, na verdade. Mas nunca atravessara a Ponte do Brandevin. A tarefa que
lhe cabia, segundo o plano original dos conspiradores, era ficar e dar
conta dos curiosos, mantendo a farsa de que o Sr. Bolseiro ainda morava em Cricôncavo o
máximo possível. Tinha até trazido algumas roupas velhas de Frodo para tornar
mais real a encenação. Eles nem imaginavam o perigo que essa encenação acabaria
representando.
- Excelente! - disse Frodo, quando entendeu o plano, - De outro modo, não poderíamos
deixar qualquer mensagem para Gandalf. É claro que não sei se esses cavaleiros
sabem ler ou não, mas não ousaria deixar uma mensagem escrita, pois poderiam entrar e
revistar a casa. Mas se Fatty está disposto a ficar na retaguarda, posso ter
certeza de que Gandalf saberá por onde fomos, e isso decide o assunto. A primeira coisa a
fazer amanhã é entrar na Floresta Velha.
- Bem, então é isso - disse Pippin. - Somando tudo, prefiro nossa tarefa à de Fatty esperar aqui até que os Cavaleiros Negros cheguem.
- Espere até ter avançado bastante na floresta - disse Fredegar. - Vão desejar estar de
volta aqui comigo antes de 24 horas.
#114
- Não adianta ficar discutindo isso - disse Merry. - Ainda temos de arrumar umas coisas e
terminar de empacotar tudo antes de dormir. Chamo vocês antes do dia nascer.
Quando finalmente se deitou, Frodo não conseguiu dormir por um tempo. As pernas lhe
doiam. Sentia-se feliz em pensar que iriam cavalgando no dia seguinte. Finalmente
caiu num sonho vago, no qual parecia estar olhando por uma janela alta sobre um mar
escuro de árvores emaranhadas. Lá embaixo, entre as raizes, ouvia-se o som de
criaturas se arrastando e farejando. Sabia que mais cedo ou mais tarde sentiriam seu
cheiro.
Depois escutou um ruído distante. A princípio, pensou ser um vento forte vindo sobre as
folhas da floresta. Então percebeu que não era o vento, mas o som do Mar
ao longe; um som que nunca ouvira quando acordado, embora com freqüência lhe perturbasse
os sonhos. De repente descobriu que estava fora de casa, ao relento. Não

havia árvore alguma no fim das contas. Estava numa charneca escura, sentindo no ar um
estranho cheiro salgado. Olhando para cima, viu uma torre branca e alta, que
se erguia solitária sobre um penhasco. Sentiu um enorme desejo de subir na torre e ver o
Mar. Começou a subir com dificuldade: mas de repente um raio cruzou o céu,
e houve um barulho de trovão.

#115
CAPITULO VI
A FLORESTA VELHA

Frodo acordou de súbito. Ainda estava escuro no quarto. Merry estava ali, com uma vela
numa mão, enquanto a outra espancava a porta. - Já vai!
O que foi? - perguntou Frodo, ainda assustado e confuso.
- o que foi? - gritou Merry. - Está na hora de acordar. São quatro e meia e há muita
neblina. Vamos! Sam já está aprontando o desjejum. Até Pippin já se levantou.
Só vou selar os pôneis e carregar a bagagem. Acorde aquele preguiçoso do Fatty! Ele pelo
menos tem de se levantar para se despedir.
Logo após as seis horas, os cinco hobbits estavam prontos para partir. Fatty Bolger ainda
bocejava. Saíram da casa em silêncio. Merry foi na frente, conduzindo um
pônei carregado, por um caminho que atravessava um matagal atrás da casa, passando por
várias plantações. As folhas das árvores reluziam, e todos os galhos gotejavam:
o orvalho gelado tornava a grama cinzenta. No silêncio reinante, ruídos distantes
pareciam próximos e claros: pássaros tagarelando num quintal, alguém fechando a
porta de uma casa ao longe.
No barracão encontraram os pôneis; pequenos animais robustos, do tipo apreciado
pelos hobbits: não velozes, mas bons para um longo dia de trabalho. Montaram,
e logo foram em direção à névoa, que parecia relutante em dar-lhes passagem, e se fechava
proibitivamente atrás deles. Depois de uma hora de viagem, devagar e sem
conversarem, viram de repente a Cerca surgir adiante. Era alta e estava coberta por uma
rede de teias de aranha prateadas.
- Como vão conseguir atravessar a Cerca? - perguntou Fredegar.
- Sigam-me e verão! - disse Merry. Dobrou à esquerda ao longo da Cerca, e logo chegaram a
um ponto onde ela se inclinava para dentro, acompanhando a beira de uma
valeta. A alguma distância da Cerca, um corte havia sido feito no solo, que descia
suavemente e entrava na terra. Nas laterais, paredes de tijolo se erguiam em linha
reta, para depois descreverem um arco, formando um túnel que mergulhava embaixo da Cerca
e saía do outro lado da valeta.
Neste ponto Fatty Bolger parou. - Adeus, Frodo! - disse ele. - Gostaria que não
estivessem indo pela Floresta. Só espero que não precisem ser resgatados antes do
fim do dia. Mas boa sorte para vocês - hoje e sempre!
- Se à nossa frente não existirem coisas piores que a Floresta Velha, serei uma pessoa de
sorte - disse Frodo. - Diga a Gandalf para se apressar
#116
através da Estrada Leste: logo voltaremos para ela, avançando o mais rápido possível. Adeus! - gritaram todos, descendo pela valeta e desaparecendo dentro do túnel.
O interior era escuro e úmido. A outra extremidade era fechada por um portão feito de
grossas barras de ferro. Merry desceu do pônei e destrancou o portão, e, quando
todos tinham passado, fechou-o novamente. Houve uma pancada e o trinco travou com um
clique.
O som era agourento.
- Pronto! - disse Merry. - Vocês deixaram o Condado, e agora estão do lado de fora, na
borda da Floresta Velha.

- As histórias que contam sobre este lugar são verdadeiras? - perguntou Pippin.
- Não sei a que histórias se refere - respondeu Merry. - Se estiver falando das histórias
de medo que as babás de Fatty lhe contavam, sobre ores, lobos e coisas
assim, diria que não. Pelo menos eu não acredito nelas. Mas a Floresta é esquisita. Tudo
nela é muito mais vivo, mais ciente do que está acontecendo, por assim dizer,
do que são as coisas no Condado. E as árvores não gostam de forasteiros. Elas vigiam as
pessoas. Geralmente, ficam satisfeitas somente em vigiar, enquanto dura a
luz do dia, e não fazem muita coisa. De vez em quando, uma árvore mais hostil pode
derrubar um galho, ou levantar uma raiz, ou agarrar você com um ramo longo, Mas
à noite as coisas podem ser mais alarmantes, pelo que ouvi dizer, Estive lá depois do
anoitecer apenas uma ou duas vezes, e só perto da Cerca. Tive a impressão de
que todas as árvores estavam cochichando entre si, passando notícias e planos numa língua
ininteligível; e os galhos balançavam e se mexiam sem qualquer vento. Na
verdade, dizem que as árvores se locomovem, e podem cercar forasteiros e prendê-los. Há
muito tempo, elas de fato atacaram a Cerca: vieram e se plantaram bem próximas,
curvando-se sobre ela. Mas vieram os hobbits e cortaram centenas de árvores; depois
fizeram uma grande fogueira na Floresta, queimando todo o solo numa longa faixa
a leste da Cerca. Depois disso as árvores desistiram de atacar, mas se tornaram muito
hostis. Ainda existe o lugar, um espaço amplo e escalvado não muito distante,
onde a fogueira foi feita.
- Só as árvores é que são perigosas? - perguntou Pippin.
- Existem várias coisas esquisitas morando dentro da Floresta, e do lado de lá - disse
Merry. - Ou pelo menos assim ouvi dizer; eu nunca vi nenhuma delas. Mas alguma
coisa deixa trilhas. Toda vez que se entra lá, pode-se encontrar trilhas abertas; elas
parecem mudar de tempo em tempo, de modo singular. Não muito longe deste túnel
há, ou houve por um longo tempo, o início de uma trilha bem larga conduzindo à Clareira
da Fogueira, e continuando mais ou menos na direção que pretendemos seguir,
para o leste e um pouco ao norte. É essa trilha que vou tentar encontrar.
#117
Agora os hobbits tinham deixado o portão do túnel e seguiam pela ampla cavidade.
Do outro lado havia uma trilha que subia até o solo da Floresta, cem metros ou
mais além da Cerca; mas desaparecia logo ao atingir o pé das árvores. Olhando para trás,
eles podiam ver a escura linha da Cerca através dos galhos das árvores,
que já se emaranhavam ao redor. A frente, só conseguiam enxergar troncos de árvores de
tamanhos e formas inumeráveis: retos ou inclinados, torcidos, curvados, grossos
ou delgados, lisos ou nodosos e cheios de galhos; e todos os galhos eram verdes ou,
quando cobertos por musgo ou lodo, cinzentos.
Só Merry parecia bastante alegre.
- É melhor você ir na frente e encontrar a trilha - disse Frodo a ele. - Não vamos nos
dispersar, e é importante sempre ter a Cerca
como ponto de referência.
Fizeram o caminho por entre as árvores, e os pôneis pisavam cuidadosamente,
evitando as muitas raizes torcidas e emaranhadas. Não havia vegetaçao rasteira. O
solo descrevia uma subida, e, conforme avançavam, parecia que as árvores se
tornavam mais altas, mais escuras
.e a Floresta mais fechada. Não se ouvia qualquer
ruído, a não ser um ocasional gotejar de umidade caindo das folhas paradas. Até agora,
não se escutava qualquer sussurro ou movimento entre os galhos; mas todos
os hobbits tinham a desagradável sensaçao de que estavam sendo observados com
desaprovação. Logo essa desaprovação se intensificou, passando a antipatia e até
inimizade.
A sensação foi ficando cada vez mais forte, até que se viram olhando rápido para cima, ou
para trás por sobre os ombros, como se esperassem um golpe repentino.
Ainda não havia nenhum sinal da trilha, e cada vez mais as árvores pareciam barrar a
passagem. De repente, Pippin sentiu que não podia suportar isso por mais tempo,
e sem avisar ninguém soltou um grito alto: - Ei! Ei! Não vou fazer mal nenhum. Apenas me
deixem passar, está bem?

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Os outros pararam, assustados; mas o grito foi sumindo, como se tivesse sido abafado por
uma cortina pesada. Não houve eco ou resposta, mas a Floresta pareceu ficar
mais fechada e mais atenta que antes.
- Eu não gritaria, se fosse você - disse Merry. - Isso pode prejudicar mais que ajudar.
Frodo começou a se perguntar se realmente era possível encontrar uma trilha, e se tinha
feito a coisa certa, trazendo os outros para aquela abominável Floresta.
Merry olhava de um lado para o outro, e parecia já não ter certeza da direção a seguir.
Pippin percebeu isso.
- Não demorou muito para nos perdermos - disse ele.
Mas nesse momento Merry deu um suspiro de alívio, e apontou para frente.
- Bem, bem - disse ele. - Estas árvores realmente mudam de lugar. Lá está a Clareira da
Fogueira à nossa frente (pelo menos espero que seja), mas a trilha que levava
a ela parece ter saído do lugar!
#118
Conforme avançavam, a floresta ficava mais bem iluminada. De repente, saíram do meio
das árvores, e se viram num amplo espaço circular. Podia se ver o céu acima, limpo e
azul; o que surpreendeu a todos, pois sob o teto da Floresta
não puderam ver o dia nascendo, nem a neblina se desvanecer. Entretanto, o sol ainda não
estava alto o suficiente para emitir raios que atingissem o centro da clareira,
embora sua luz alcançasse as copas das árvores. Na borda da clareira, todas as folhas
eram mais densas e verdes, cercando o lugar com uma parede quase sólida. Nenhuma
árvore crescia ali, apenas um mato grosso e muitas plantas altas: cicutas e salsas-domato de talo comprido e amarelado, ervas-de-fogo que se abriam em penugens
cinzentas, urtigas e cardos exuberantes. Um lugar triste, mas que comparado à densa
Floresta parecia um jardim alegre e encantador.
Os hobbits se sentiram encorajados, olhando cheios de esperança para a luz do dia que se
espalhava no céu. Do outro lado da clareira, havia uma falha na parede de
árvores, e além dela uma trilha bem desenhada. Podia-se ver que a trilha entrava na
Floresta e que em alguns pontos era larga e descoberta, embora de vez em quando
as árvores se aproximassem e a cobrissem com a sombra de seus galhos escuros. Foram por
ali. Continuavam a subir suavemente, mas agora com muito mais rapidez e com
os corações mais leves, parecia que a Floresta estava mais branda, e que afinal iria
deixá-los passar sem grandes dificuldades.
Mas depois de uns momentos o ar ficou quente e abafado. As árvores começaram a se
aproximar dos dois lados da trilha, e não se conseguia enxergar muito à frente.
Agora sentiam novamente, e mais forte que nunca, a má disposição da Floresta exercendo
pressão sobre eles.
O silêncio era tão grande que o ruído dos cascos dos pôneis,
farfalhando nas folhas mortas e ocasionalmente tropeçando em raizes escondidas, parecia
um estrondo aos ouvidos. Frodo tentou cantar alguma coisa para encorajá-los,
mas sua voz não passava de um murmúrio:
ó vós que vagais pela terra sombria confiai! Porque, embora negra se estenda, termina
afloresta algures algum dia,
o sol que se abre penetra sua tenda;
sol que levanta, o sol que anoitece,
dia que termina, o dia que começa. Pois a leste e a oeste a floresta perece...
Perece - logo após ter dito a palavra, sua voz desapareceu. O ar parecia pesado, fazendo
com que pronunciar palavras ficasse muito cansativo. Logo atrás deles, um
grande ramo caiu de uma velha árvore, quebrando-se com um estalo no solo. As árvores
pareciam se fechar à frente deles.
#119
- Elas não gostam dessa coisa de terminar e perecer - disse Merry. Eu não cantaria mais
nada agora. Espere até chegarmos à borda, e então nos viraremos para elas,
cantando num coro bem alto!

Falava de modo alegre, e embora pudesse estar bastante ansioso, não o deixava
transparecer. Os outros não responderam. Estavam deprimidos. Um grande peso se instalava
no coração de Frodo, que a cada passo se arrependia de ter desafiado a ameaça que as
árvores representavam. Estava de fato quase parando e propondo que voltassem
(se ainda era possível), quando as coisas mudaram de rumo. A trilha, antes inclinada,
ficou quase plana. As escuras árvores se afastaram para os lados, e à frente
podia-se ver a trilha seguindo quase em linha reta. Diante deles, mas ainda a certa
distância, surgia o topo verde de uma colina, sem árvores, erguendo-se como uma
cabeça calva acima da Floresta ao redor. A trilha parecia ir direto para lá.
Agora avançavam rápido novamente, deliciados com a idéia de subir acima do nível do teto
da Floresta por uns momentos. A trilha desceu, e depois começou a subir
de novo, conduzindo-os finalmente ao pé da encosta íngreme da colina. Ali abandonava as
árvores e sumia dentro da turfa. A mata se erguia em toda a volta da colina,
como uma cabeleira espessa que terminava abruptamente num círculo em volta de uma coroa
raspada.
Os hobbits conduziram os poneis colina acima, descrevendo voltas e mais voltas até
alcançarem o topo. Ali pararam e olharam tudo ao seu redor. Com a luz do sol,
o ar brilhava, embora ainda envolvido pela névoa, que os impedia de enxergar longe. Perto
de onde estavam a névoa já tinha se dissipado quase totalmente; embora
aqui e acolá ainda se depositasse em depressóes na vegetação, e ao sul ainda subisse como
vapor ou mechas de fumaça branca.
- Aquela - disse Merry apontando com a mão -, aquela é a linha do Voltavime. Ele desce
das Colinas e corre em direção ao sudoeste pelo meio da Floresta, para se
juntar ao Brandevin abaixo de Fim da Sebe. Não devemos ir por ali! O vale do Voltavime é
tido como a parte mais estranha de toda a mata - é como se fosse o centro
de onde as coisas estranhas vêm.
Os outros olharam na direção em que Merry apontava, mas não conseguiram ver quase nada
além da névoa cobrindo o vale úmido e profundo; além desse ponto, a parte
sul da Floresta sumia de vista.
O sol no topo da colina agora ficava quente. Deveria ser por volta de onze horas, mas a
cerração do outono ainda os impedia de enxergar muita coisa nas outras direções.
No lado oeste, não conseguiam enxergar nem a Cerca nem o vale do Brandevin além dela. Ao
norte, para onde olhavam com mais esperanças, não enxergavam nada que pudesse
ser a linha da grande Estrada Leste, para a qual se dirigiam. Estavam ilhados num mar de
árvores, e o horizonte parecia coberto por um véu.
#120
No lado sudeste, o solo descia íngreme, como se as encostas da colina mergulhassem por
baixo das árvores; pareciam encostas de uma ilha, que na verdade é uma montanha
que se ergue de águas profundas. Sentaram-se na borda verde e olharam para a mata abaixo
deles, enquanto comiam sua refeição do meio-dia. À medida que o sol ia subindo
e passava do meio-dia, puderam ver na distância ao leste as linhas verde-acinzentadas das
Colinas que ficavam além da Floresta Velha daquele lado. Aquilo os animou
muito, pois era bom ver o sinal de qualquer coisa além dos limites da mata, embora sua
intenção não fosse ir por ali, se pudessem evitar: as Colinas dos Túmulos
tinham nas lendas dos hobbits uma reputação tão sinistra quanto a própria Floresta.
Finalmente decidiram continuar a viagem. A trilha que os trouxera até a colina
reapareceu do lado norte; mas depois de segui-la por certo tempo perceberam que ela
se curvava cada vez mais para a direita. Logo começaram a descer rapidamente, e
imaginaram que a trilha devia realmente conduzi-los para o vale do Voltavime: não
era em hipótese alguma a direção que desejavam tomar. Depois de discutirem o assunto,
resolveram abandonar essa trilha enganosa e rumar para o norte; pois, embora
não tivessem conseguido enxergar nada quando estavam na colina, a Estrada devia ficar
daquele lado, e não poderia estar a muitas milhas de distância. Além disso,
do lado norte e à esquerda da trilha, o terreno parecia mais seco e mais aberto, subindo
encostas onde a mata era mais rala, e pinheiros e outras árvores coníferas

tomavam o lugar dos carvalhos e freixos e outras árvores estranhas e sem nome da mata
mais densa.
Num primeiro momento, pareceu que tinham feito uma boa escolha: avançaram numa velocidade
razoável, mas toda vez que vislumbravam o sol em alguma clareira, tinham
a inexplicável sensação de estarem enveredando para o leste. Entretanto, depois de um
tempo, as árvores começaram a se fechar de novo, exatamente nos pontos em que
à distância tinham parecido menos densas e entrelaçadas. Então, de repente, surgiram no
solo grandes dobras, que pareciam marcas feitas por rodas de carroças gigantescas;
eram sulcos largos como estradas afundadas, há muito sem uso e sufocadas por espinheiros.
Essas dobras geralmente cruzavam o caminho que desejavam fazer, e eles
só Podiam atravessá-las descendo e depois subindo de novo, o que era problemático e
dificil para os pôneis. Cada vez que desciam, encontravam a depressão cheia de
arbustos densos e de um mato emaranhado, que de alguma forma não davam passagem à
esquerda, e só se abriam quando eles viravam para a direita. Além disso, era preciso
caminhar um tanto no fundo, até conseguirem encontrar uma passagem para a outra margem.
Cada vez que saíam do sulco, as árvores pareciam mais profundas e
#121
escuras, e era sempre mais difícil achar passagens à esquerda e para cima, o que Os
forçava a ir para a direita e para baixo.
Depois de uma ou duas horas, tinham perdido completamente o senso de direção, embora
soubessem muito bem que tinham deixado de rumar para o Norte havia muito tempo.
Estavam sendo conduzidos, simplesmente seguindo um curso escolhido para eles - em direção
ao leste e ao sul, para dentro do coração da Floresta, e não o contrário.
A tarde já terminava quando atingiram aos trancos e barrancos uma vala mais larga
e profunda que todas que já tinham encontrado. O declive era tão acentuado e o mato tão
denso que ficou impossível sair dali, de qualquer um dos
lados, sem que deixassem para trás os pôneis e a bagagem. Tudo o que podiam fazer era
seguir caminho pela própria vala - para baixo. o solo ficou fofo, e em alguns
pontos lamacento; nascentes de água apareceram nas margens, e logo eles se viram seguindo
um riacho que corria e murmurava através do leito coberto de mato. Então
o solo começou a descer rapidamente, e o riacho ficou mais caudaloso e a correnteza mais
forte, fluindo e pulando colina abaixo. Estavam agora num fosso fundo, escuro
e coberto por árvores que formavam um arco muito acima de suas cabeças.
Depois de avançarem aos tropeços por algum tempo ao longo da corrente de água, de repente
saíram da escuridão, como se através de um portão vissem a luz do sol diante
deles. Passando pela abertura, descobriram que tinham, através de uma fissura, descido
uma ladeira alta e íngreme, quase um penhasco. Na base dela se estendia uma
ampla área coberta por gramíneas e juncos, e ao longe podia-se ver outra ladeira, quase
tão íngreme quanto a primeira. Uma tarde dourada de sol tardio se deitava
morna e sonolenta sobre a terra escondida entre as duas ladeiras. Bem no meio, um rio de
águas escuras descrevia curvas lentas, ladeado por salgueiros antigos, coberto
por um arco de ramos de salgueiro, bloqueado por salgueiros caídos e salpicado de
milhares de folhas de salgueiro amarelecidas.
O ar estava cheio delas, caindo amarelecidas
de seus galhos; de fato havia uma brisa morna e suave soprando de leve no vale, e os
juncos farfalhavam, e os ramos de salgueiro estalavam.
- Bem, agora pelo menos tenho uma noção de onde estamos! - disse Merry - Viemos em
direção quase oposta ao que pretendíamos. Este é o rio Voltavime! Vou avançar um
pouco e explorar o lugar.
Passou à frente, entrando na região iluminada pelo sol, e desapareceu dentro do mato
alto. Depois de um tempo reapareceu, e disse que o solo era razoavelmente sólido
entre o pé do penhasco e o rio; alguns trechos eram cobertos por turfa firme até a beira
da água.
- Além disso - disse ele -, parece existir algo parecido com uma trilha sinuosa ao longo
deste lado do

rio. Se virarmos à esquerda e seguirmos por ela, podemos acabar chegando ao lado leste da
Floresta.
- Acho que sim! - disse Pippin. - Quer dizer, se a trilha continuar até lá, e não nos
levar simplesmente para um brejo sem saída. Quem você acha que fez essa trilha,
e por quê? Tenho certeza de que não foi para nos ajudar. Estou ficando muito desconfiado
desta Floresta e de tudo dentro dela, e começo a acreditar em todas as histórias
que contam. E você tem alguma idéia da distância que teremos de percorrer rumo ao leste?
- Nenhuma - disse Merry. - Não sei nem em que altura do Voltavime estamos, e quem viria
aqui com freqüência suficiente para fazer uma trilha. Mas não consigo pensar
em outra saída.
Não havendo mais nada a fazer, seguiram em fila, Merry indo na frente pela trilha há
pouco descoberta. Por toda a volta os juncos e o mato eram altos e exuberantes,
em alguns trechos subindo muito acima de suas cabeças; mas, uma vez encontrada a trilha,
foi fácil seguir por ela, pois fazia curvas e dava voltas como se escolhesse
o solo mais seguro por entre os brejos e poças. Aqui e ali passava sobre outros córregos,
que desciam dos pontos mais altos da mata através de sulcos, para desaguar
no Voltavime. Nesses trechos, troncos de árvores ou feixes de lenha tinham sido
cuidadosamente colocados para possibilitar a passagem.
Agora os hobbits começavam a sentir muito calor. Exércitos de moscas de todos os tipos
zumbiam-lhes nas orelhas, e o sol da tarde queimava suas costas. Finalmente
chegaram a uma tênue sombra, projetada por ramos longos e cinzentos que chegavam até a
trilha. Cada passo que davam era mais dificil que o anterior. Parecia que
uma moleza brotava do solo e subialhes pelas pernas, e também caía mansa pelo ar sobre
suas cabeças e olhos.
Frodo sentiu o queixo caindo e a cabeça pendendo. Logo à frente, Pippin caiu de joelhos.
Frodo parou.
- Não adianta - ele ouviu Merry dizendo. - Não consigo dar
mais um passo sem descansar. Preciso dormir. Está fresco embaixo dos salgueiros. Menos
moscas!
Frodo não gostou do modo como soava a voz de Merry -Vamos! - gritou ele. - Não podemos
descansar ainda. Temos primeiro de sair desta
Floresta.
- Mas os outros estavam meio inconscientes e não prestaram atenção. Bem ao seu lado Sam
parou, bocejando e piscando, quase sem dar conta de si.
De repente o próprio Frodo sentiu que o sono lhe tomava conta do corpo. A cabeça rodava.
Agora parecia não haver ruído algum no ar. As moscas tinham parado de zumbir.
Apenas um som baixinho, no limite da audição, um farfalhar suave como de uma canção meio
sussurrada, parecia agitar os galhos acima. Frodo levantou os olhos pesados
e viu um grande salgueiro, velho e esbranquiçado, a se debruçar sobre ele. Parecia
enorme, os galhos
#123
esticados para cima, erguendo-se como braços com muitas mãos de dedos longos, o tronco
nodoso e retorcido se abrindo em largas fendas que estalavam baixinho quando
os galhos se moviam. As folhas agitadas contra o céu brilhante lhe ofuscaram a visão, e
ele tombou para frente, ficando deitado e imóvel sobre o mato, no mesmo lugar
onde tinha caído.
Merry e Pippin se arrastaram um pouco mais para frente, deitando com as costas apoiadas
no tronco do salgueiro. Atrás deles as grandes fendas se abriram, como que
para recebê-los, enquanto a árvore balançava e estalava. Olharam para cima, para as
folhas amarelas e cinzentas, que se moviam suavemente contra a luz e cantavam.
Fecharam os olhos, e então pareceu-lhes que quase podiam escutar palavras, palavras
apaziguadoras, dizendo algo sobre água e sono. Cederam ao encanto e caíram em
sono profundo ao pé do grande salgueiro esbranquiçado.

Frodo ficou por uns momentos deitado, lutando contra o sono que o dominava; então, com um
enorme esforço, ficou em pé novamente. Sentia um implacável desejo de água
fresca.
- Espere aqui, Sam - gaguejou ele. Lavar os pés um pouquinho.
Quase sonâmbulo, foi cambaleando até o lado da árvore que dava para o rio, onde grandes
raizes arcadas cresciam dentro da água, como pequenos dragões encaroçados
esticando o corpo para beber água, Sentou-se sobre uma dessas e começou a bater os pés
quentes na água fresca e escura; ali mesmo adormeceu de repente, com as costas
apoiadas na árvore.
Sam sentou-se e coçou a cabeça, a boca se abrindo num bocejo como uma caverna. Estava
preocupado. A tarde avançava e essa sonolência não parecia normal. - Existe
mais por trás disto do que apenas sol e ar quente - murmurou ele para si mesmo. - Não
gosto desta árvore grande. Não confio nela. Ainda por cima cantando coisas
sobre sono! Isso não pode estar certo!
Pôs-se de pé e foi cambaleando ver o que tinha acontecido com os pÔneis. Descobriu que
dois deles tinham avançado uma boa distância pela trilha. Estava trazendo-os
de volta para junto dos outros quando ouviu dois ruídos; um alto, e outro baixo, mas
muito claro.
O primeiro foi o som de algo pesado caindo na água; o outro era
um barulho parecido com o que um trinco faz quando se tranca uma porta com cuidado.
Voltou correndo à margem. Frodo estava na água, perto da beira, e uma grande raiz
da árvore parecia estar por cima dele, impulsionando-o para baixo, mas ele não
lutava contra isso. Sam agarrou-o pelo casaco, arrastando-o para longe do alcance da
raiz; depois, com dificuldade, trouxe-o até a margem. Frodo acordou quase imediatamente,
tossindo e engasgado.
- Sabe de uma coisa, Sam - disse ele finalmente. - Esta árvore abominável me atirou na
água! Eu senti! Aquela raiz grande virou e simplesmente me derrubou na água!
#124
- O senhor estava sonhando, eu acho, Sr. Frodo - disse Sam. - Não devia ter sentado num
lugar desses, se estava com tanto sono.
- E os outros? - perguntou Frodo. - Fico pensando que tipo de sonhos estarão tendo.
Os dois deram a volta, chegando ao outro lado da árvore, e então Sam entendeu o clique
que tinha escutado. Pippin desaparecera. A fenda da árvore perto da qual se
deitara tinha se fechado, de modo que não se via mais nem sinal dela. Merry estava preso:
uma outra fenda tinha se fechado na altura da sua cintura, deixando as
pernas de fora, mas o resto do corpo estava dentro de uma abertura escura, cujas bordas o
prensavam como uma pinça.
Primeiro, Frodo e Sam bateram no tronco da árvore onde Pippin tinha deitado. Depois
tentaram com todas as forças abrir a mandíbula da fenda que prendia o pobre Merry.
Nada disso adiantou.
- Que coisa horrível! - gritou Frodo desesperado. - Por que fomos entrar nesta Floresta
terrível? Queria que tivéssemos voltado para Cricôncavo! - Chutou a árvore
com toda a força, sem se importar com os próprios pés. Um tremor quase imperceptível
percorreu toda a árvore, do caule até os galhos; as folhas farfalharam e sussurraram,
mas agora produzindo um som que parecia uma risada distante e fraca.
- Suponho que não temos um machado na bagagem, Sr. Frodo? - perguntou Sam.
- Eu trouxe uma pequena machadinha para cortar lenha - disse Frodo.
- Não ajudaria muito.
- Espere um pouco! - gritou Sam, agitado por uma idéia sugerida pela palavra
lenha". - Podemos fazer alguma coisa com fogo!
- Sim, podemos - disse Frodo cheio de dúvidas. - Mas também podemos assar Pippin vivo lá
dentro.
- Para começar, podemos tentar ferir ou amedrontar esta árvore - disse Sam, furioso. - Se
isto não os libertar, eu derrubo a árvore, nem que seja a dentadas. - Correu
até os pôneis e logo depois voltou com duas caixas de pederneiras e uma machadinha.

Rapidamente juntaram capim e folhas secas, e pedaços de casca de árvore; fizeram uma
pilha de gravetos e galhos cortados. Amontoaram tudo contra o tronco, no lado
da árvore oposto àquele onde estavam os prisioneiros. Logo que Sam lançou uma faísca, o
capim seco começou a queimar, e uma lufada de chamas e fumaça subiu. Os gravetos
estalavam. Pequenas línguas de fogo lambiam a casca sulcada da velha árvore, chamuscandoa. Um tremor percorreu todo o salgueiro. As folhas pareciam sibilar sobre
as cabeças deles com um ruído de dor e raiva. Um berro agudo veio de Merry, e de dentro
da árvore escutaram Pippin dar um grito abafado.
- Apague isso! Apague! - gritou Merry. - Ele vai me partir em dois se você não apagar.
Ele está dizendo!
#125
- Quem? O quê? - berrou Frodo, dando a volta rápido até o outro lado da árvore.
- Apague isso! Apague o fogo! - implorou Merry, Os galhos do salgueiro começaram a
balançar violentamente. Um ruído como o do vento começou a subir e a se espalhar
pelos galhos de todas as outras árvores em volta, como se tivessem derrubado uma pedra no
sono quieto do vale, provocando ondas de fúria que se alastravam por toda
a Floresta. Sam começou a chutar a pequena fogueira e a pisar nas faíscas. Mas Frodo, sem
ter uma idéia clara do motivo pelo qual fazia isto, ou do que esperava
conseguir, correu ao longo da trilha gritando socorro! socorro! socorro! Tinha a
impressão de mal poder ouvir o som agudo da própria voz, carregada para longe pelo
vento do salgueiro e sufocada pelo clamor das folhas, assim que as palavras saíam de sua
boca. Sentiu-se desesperado: perdido e estúpido.
De repente parou. ouviu uma resposta, ou pelo menos pensou ter ouvido- parecia que vinha
de trás, da parte baixa da trilha, dentro da Floresta. Voltou-se e escutou,
e logo não teve mais dúvidas: alguém entoava uma canção- uma voz grave e alegre cantava,
despreocupada e alegre, mas as palavras não faziam sentido:
Ei boneca!.feliz neneca! dingue-dongue dilo! Dingue-clongue! Não delongue! Largue logo
aquilo! Tom Bom,.jovial Tom, Tom Bombadillo.
Meio esperançosos e meio amedrontados por algum possível novo perigo, Frodo e Sam ficaram
paralisados. De repente, saindo de uma longa cadeia de palavras sem sentido
(ou pelo menos assim parecia), a voz ficou mais alta e clara, explodindo nesta canção:
Vem, linda boneca! bela neneca! Querida minha! Leve é o vento e leve é a pluma da
andorinha.
Lá embaixo sob a Montanha, ao sol brilhando, À luz da lua, na soleirajá esperando,
Minha linda senhora está,filha da mulher do Rio, Mais clara do que a água, esbelta qual
ramo esguio.
O velho Tom Bombadil, nenúfares carregando,
Salta de volta pra casa. Podes ouvi-lo cantando? Vem, linda boneca, bela neneca!feliz e
bela,
Fruta d'Ouro, Fruta d'Ouro, linda amora amarela! Pobre e velho salgueiro, esconde tuas
raizes!
Tom tem pressa agora. Há noites e dias felizes. Tom de volta de novo, nenúfares
carregando.
Vem, linda boneca, bela neneca! Podes ouvir-me cantando?
#126
Frodo e Sam pareciam enfeitiçados. O vento foi abrandando. As folhas não se agitavam mais
nos galhos paralisados. Houve nova explosão de música, e então, de repente,
saltando e dançando pela trilha, apareceu por cima dos juncos um velho chapéu gasto, de
copa alta e com uma pena azul comprida presa à fita. Com mais um salto e
um pulo, apareceu um homem, ou pelo menos assim parecia. De qualquer modo, era grande e
pesado demais para ser um hobbit, embora não alto o suficiente para ser uma
pessoa grande; mas o barulho que fazia era digno de uma delas, pisando forte com grandes
botas amarelas que lhe cobriam as pernas grossas, e avançando pelo capinzal.

e por entre os juncos como uma vaca que desce para beber água. Vestia um casaco azul e
tinha uma longa barba castanha; os olhos eram claros e azuis, o rosto vermelho
como uma maçã madura, mas que se franzia em inúmeras rugas provocadas pela sua risada.
Trazia nas mãos
uma enorme folha, à guisa de bandeja, que sustentava um
pequeno ramalhete de nenúfares brancos.
- Socorro! - gritaram Frodo e Sam, correndo em direção a ele com os braços estendidos.
- Ooh! Ooh! quietos aí! - gritou o velho, levantando uma mão, ao que eles pararam
imediatamente, como se tivessem sido paralisados. - Agora, meus pequenos camaradas,
aonde vão assim, bufando como foles? Qual é o problema aqui? Sabem quem eu sou? Meu nome
é Tom Bombadil. Contem-me seu problema! Tom está com pressa. Não amassem
meus nenúfares!
- Meus amigos estão presos no salgueiro - gritou Frodo, quase sem fôlego.
- O Sr. Merry está sendo esmagado numa fenda - berrou Sam.
- O quê? - gritou Tom Bombadil, dando um salto no ar. - O Velho Salgueiro-homem? Nada
pior que isso? Podemos resolver isso logo. Conheço a melodia para ele. Velho
Salgueiro-homem cinzento! Vou congelar a seiva dele, se não se comportar. Vou cantar até
que as raizes saiam do solo. Vou cantar para levantar um vento que leva
embora folha e ramo. Este Velho Salgueiro-homem!
Aninhando cuidadosamente os nenúfares no chão, correu até a árvore. Ali viu os pés de
Merry ainda de fora - o restojá tinha sido tragado pela árvore. Tom colocou
a boca perto da fenda e começou a cantar dentro dela em voz baixa. Os hobbits não
conseguiam entender as palavras, mas ficou evidente que Merry estava acordando.
Suas pernas começaram a chutar. Tom pulou para trás, e quebrando um galho que pendia
começou a golpear a árvore com ele. - Deixe-os sair, Velho
Salgueiro-homem!
- disse ele. - O que está pensando? Não deveria estar acordado. Coma terra! Cave fundo!
Beba água! Vá dormir! Bombadil está falando! - Então agarrou os pés de Merry
e o puxou da fenda que se abriu de repente.
#127
Houve um estalo violento e a outra fenda se abriu, e dela Pippin pulou, como se tivesse
sido chutado, Então, com um estalido ruidoso, as duas fendas se fecharam
novamente. A árvore tremeu desde a raiz até a copa, depois do que fez-se absoluto
silêncio.
- Obrigado! - disseram os hobbits, um após o outro.
Tom Bombadil desatou a rir. - Bem, meus pequenos camaradas! disse ele, abaixando-se para
poder enxergar melhor os rostos deles. - Vocês vêm para casa comigo! A mesa
está posta com creme amarelo, favos de mel e pão branco com manteiga. Fruta d'Ouro está
esperando. Teremos tempo para perguntas enquanto comermos. Sigam-me o mais
rápido que conseguirem! - Com isso apanhou os nenúfares, e então com um aceno de mão foi
pulando e dançando pela trilha em direção ao leste, ainda cantando alto
uma cançao que não fazia sentido.
Surpresos e aliviados demais para poderem conversar, os hobbits o seguiram o mais rápido
que puderam. Mas isso não era rápido o suficiente. Tom logo desapareceu
na frente deles, e o som de sua música ficou mais fraco e distante. De repente sua voz
voltou, flutuando num alto Olá!
Saltando, meus amiguinhos, vamos o Rio vencer! Tom chegará na frente, e velas irá
acender.
A oeste desce o sol: logo a treva cairá,
Quando a noite se abater, então a porta se abrirá, Nas janelas vai brilhar da luz o
bruxuleio.
Não temer o negro amieiro! Não ouvir o velho salgueiro! Não temer ramo ou raiz. Tom lá
estará na certa. Salve,
feliz neneca! Esperemos de porta aberta!
Depois disso os hobbits não ouviram mais nada. Quase imediatamente, o sol começou a
afundar nas árvores atrás deles. Pensaram na luz oblíqua da noite brilhando no

rio Brandevin, e nas janelas de Buqueburgo começando a se iluminar com centenas de
lamparinas. Sombras enormes cruzaram o caminho; troncos e galhos de árvores pendiam
escuros e ameaçadores sobre a trilha. Uma névoa branca começou a subir em espirais na
superficie do rio, espalhando-se pelas raizes das árvores sobre as margens.
Do solo bem debaixo de seus pés, um vapor sombrio subia e se misturava no crepúsculo que
caía rapidamente.
Ficou dificil seguir a trilha, pois estavam muito cansados. Sentiam as pernas como
chumbo. Ruídos estranhos e furtivos percorriam os arbustos e juncos dos dois lados;
se olhavam para o céu claro, viam rostos retorcidos e deformados, que projetavam sombras
escuras contra o crepúsculo, olhando de soslaio para eles, dos altos barrancos
e das bordas da floresta.

#128
Eles começaram a sentir que toda aquela terra era irreal, e que estavam caminhando num
sonho agourento, do qual nunca acordavam.
No momento em que perceberam que os pés não poderiam mais seguir adiante, notaram que o
solo subia suavemente. A água começou a murmurar. No escuro, enxergaram um
reluzir branco de espuma, no ponto onde o rio corria sobre uma pequena cascata. Então, de
repente, as árvores acabaram e a névoa ficou para trás. Saíram da Floresta,
encontrando um grande espaço gramado à sua frente. O rio, agora pequeno e rápido, descia
num salto alegre para recebê-los, brilhando aqui e ali com o reflexo das
estrelas, que já iluminavam o céu.
A grama sob seus pés era macia e curta, como se tivesse sido podada. Os limites da
Floresta atrás deles estavam desbastados e aparados como uma cerca-viva. A trilha
agora se estendia plana à frente, bem cuidada e ladeada por pedras. Ia fazendo curvas até
o topo de um rochedo coberto de grama, agora pintado de cinza pela luz
das estrelas; e lá adiante, ainda acima, no topo de um outro barranco, viram as luzes de
uma casa piscando. A trilha desceu mais uma vez, e subiu de novo, ao longo
de uma encosta suave coberta de turfa, em direção às luzes. De repente, um largo facho de
luz amarela fluiu brilhante de dentro de uma porta que se abria. Ali, à
sua frente, estava a casa de Tom Bombadil, acima, abaixo, sob a colina. Atrás da casa
havia uma saliência íngreme do solo, cinzenta e nua, e além dela as formas
escuras das Colinas dos Túmulos sumiam a leste dentro da noite.
Todos correram naquela direção, hobbits e pôneis. Metade do cansaço e metade do medo já
tinham ficado para trás. Vem, filiz neneca! rolava a canção para saudá-los.
Vem, feliz neneca! Vamos dançando, queridos! Hobbits e póneis todos! Somos por
festa caídos. Agora a alegria começa! Vamosjuntos cantar!
Então uma outra voz limpa, jovem e velha como a Primavera, como a canção da água que flui
alegre noite adentro, vinda de uma clara manhã nas colinas, veio descendo
sobre eles como uma chuva de prata:
Entoe-se agora a canção! Vamosjuntos cantar
O sol e a estrela, a lua e a neblina, a chuva e nuvem no ar, A luz sobre o botão, sobre a
pluma o orvalho,
O vento no campo aberto, aflor no arbusto vário, À sombra do lado ojunco, nemfares sobre
o Rio: A bela Filha das Águas e o velho Tom Bombadil.
E com essa canção os hobbits pisaram na soleira
da porta, e foram então cobertos
por uma luz dourada.

os quatro hobbits atravessaram a ampla soleira de pedra e depois pararam, piscando.
Estavam numa sala comprida e baixa, iluminada por
lamparinas penduradas às vigas
do teto; sobre a mesa de madeira escura e polida queimavam muitas velas, altas e
amarelas, emitindo uma luz forte.
Numa cadeira, do lado oposto à porta de entrada, estava uma mulher. os longos cabelos
loiros caíam em cachos sobre seus ombros; o vestido era verde, verde como juncos
novos, salpicado de prata como gotas de orvalho; o cinto de ouro parecia uma corrente de
lírios-roxos, presa por botões azuis de miosótis. Rodeando-lhe os pés, em
grandes vasilhas de cerâmica verde e azul, boiavam nenúfares brancos, e ela parecia estar
num trono no centro de um lago.
- Entrem, caros convidados! - disse ela. Ao ouvi-la falar, os hobbits reconheceram a voz
cristalina que tinham ouvido cantando. Deram alguns passos tímidos adiante,
e começaram a fazer reverências, sentindo-se estranhamente surpresos e desajeitados, como
pessoas que, batendo à porta de uma choupana para pedir um copo de água,
tivessem sido atendidas por uma jovem e bela rainha-élfica toda coberta de flores. Mas
antes que pudessem dizer qualquer coisa, ela pulou por sobre os nenúfares
e correu na direção deles, rindo; enquanto corria, seu vestido fazia um ruído suave, como
o do vento agitando as flores à margem de um rio.
- Venham, meus queridos! - disse ela, pegando Frodo pela mão. - Vamos rir e nos divertir!
Sou Fruta d'Ouro, Filha do Rio. - Então passou ligeiramente por eles para
fechar a porta, dando depois as costas para a entrada, com os braços brancos abertos. Vamos trancar a noite lá fora, pois talvez ainda estejam com medo, da neblina,
das sombras das árvores, das águas profundas e das coisas hostis. Nada temam! Pois esta
noite estão sob o teto de Tom Bombadil.
Os hobbits olhavam-na maravilhados; ela olhou para cada um deles, sorrindo. - Bela
senhora Fruta d'Ouro - disse Frodo finalmente, sentindo seu coração se encher
de uma alegria que não conseguia entender. Estava maravilhado como já tinha ficado em
outras ocasiões, ao ouvir belas vozes élficas; mas o encanto que agora tomava
conta dele era diferente: menos agudo e grandioso, mas mais profundo e próximo dos
corações mortais, maravilhoso, mas não estranho.
- Bela senhora Fruta d'Ouro - disse ele de novo. - Agora a alegria escondida nas canções
que escutamos se revela diante de mim.
#130
Mais clara do que a água, esbelta qual ramo esguio! Junco nafonte viva, linda Filha do
Rio!
Na primavera e verão, na primavera prolongada!
O canto da cascata, das folhas a risada!
De repente parou, gaguejando, tomado pela surpresa de se ver dizendo essas coisas. Mas
Fruta d'Ouro riu.
- Bem-vindos! - disse ela. - Nunca ouvi dizer que as pessoas do Condado pudessem dizer
coisas tão doces. Mas vejo que é um amigo-doselfos; posso ver isso na luz
dos seus olhos e no tom da sua voz. Este é um feliz encontro! Sentem-se agora, e esperem
pelo Senhor da casa. Ele não vai demorar. Está cuidando de seus animais
cansados.
Os hobbits, alegres, sentaram-se em cadeiras baixas de junco, enquanto Fruta d'Ouro se
ocupava em pôr a mesa; os olhos deles a seguiam, pois a graça esguia de seus
movimentos os enchia de um prazer sereno. De algum ponto atrás da casa, vinha o som de
cantoria. Entre muitos lindas bonecas e belas nenecas e dingue-dongues não
delongues, ouviam-se, repetidas vezes, as seguintes palavras:
O velho Tom Bombadil é mesmo bom camarada; Azul-claro é suajaqueta, a bota é amarelada.
- Linda senhora! - disse Frodo novamente, depois de um tempo. Diga-me, se minha pergunta
não parece tola, quem é Tom Bombadil?
- Ele é - disse ela, cessando seus movimentos rápidos e sorrindo. Frodo olhou para ela
curioso. - Ele é, como

já viram - disse ela em resposta ao olhar de Frodo.
- Ele é o Senhor da floresta, das águas e das colinas.
- Então toda esta região estranha lhe pertence?
- Na verdade não! - respondeu ela, e o sorriso que tinha no rosto desapareceu. - Isso
seria um fardo pesado demais - acrescentou ela em voz baixa, como se falasse
consigo mesma. - As árvores e o capim e todas as coisas que crescem ou vivem neste lugar
só pertencem a si mesmas. Tom Bombadil é o Senhor. Ninguém jamais prendeu
o velho Tom quando ele caminhava pela floresta, atravessava as águas, ou pulava nos topos
das colinas, seja de noite, seja de dia. Ele não tem medo. Tom Bombadil
é o Senhor.
Uma porta se abriu e por ela entrou Tom Bombadil. Agora estava sem chapéu, e uma coroa de
folhas do outono adornava seu cabelo castanho e espesso. Riu e, dirigindo-se
até Fruta d'Ouro, tomou sua mão.
- Aqui está minha bela senhora - disse ele, fazendo uma reverência diante dos hobbits. Aqui está minha Fruta d'Ouro, toda vestida de verdeprata e com flores no
cinto!
A mesa está posta? Vejo creme amarelo e favos

de mel, e pão branco com manteiga; leite, queijo e ervas verdes e frutas maduras. É o
suficiente para nós? A ceia está pronta?
- A ceia está - disse Fruta d'Ouro -, mas talvez os convidados não estejam.
Tom gritou, batendo palmas: - Tom, Tom! seus convidados estão cansados, e você quase
tinha esquecido! Venham agora, meus alegres amigos, e Tom cuidará para que se
refresquem. Vão limpar as mãos encardidas, lavar os rostos cansados, tirar as capas
enlameadas e pentear os cabelos embaraçados!
Tom abriu a porta e eles o seguiram por um corredor curto que virava bruscamente.
Chegaram a um quarto baixo, com teto inclinado (um puxado, ao que parecia, construido
do lado norte da casa). As paredes eram de pedra lisa, mas na maior parte cobertas por
cortinas e tapetes verdes e amarelos.
O chão também era de pedra, coberto com juncos verdes e novos. Havia quatro colchões
macios, ao
lado dos quais ficava uma pilha de cobertores brancos, colocados sobre o chão. Contra a
parede oposta
estava um banco comprido, cheio de grandes vasilhas de barro, e perto dele ficavam jarros
cor de terra, alguns com água fria, outros com água fumegante. Ao lado
de cada cama, chinelos fofos e verdes, prontos para serem usados.
Logo depois, de banho tomado e reconfortados, os hobbits estavam sentados à mesa, dois de
cada lado, e nas pontas sentaram-se Fruta d'Ouro e o Senhor. Foi uma refeição
longa e alegre. Embora os hobbits tenham comido como só os hobbits mais famintos sabem
comer, não faltou nada. A bebida em suas vasilhas parecia água fresca e cristalina,
mas entrava-lhes nos corações como vinho, libertando suas vozes. De repente, os
convidados perceberam que estavam cantando alegremente, como se cantar fosse mais
fácil e natural que conversar.
Finalmente Tom e Fruta d'Ouro se levantaram e tiraram a mesa rapidamente. Ordenaram aos
convidados que sentassem quietos, o que fizeram em poltronas acompanhadas
de banquinhos para os pés cansados. O fogo na ampla lareira diante deles queimava com um
cheiro doce, como se fosse alimentado de troncos de macieiras. Quando tudo
estava em ordem, apagaram-se todas as luzes da sala, com a exceção de uma lamparina e de
um par de velas, colocadas em cada um dos lados da guarda da chaminé. Então
Fruta d'Ouro se aproximou deles, segurando uma vela; desejou-lhes boa noite e um sono
profundo.
- Fiquem em paz agora - disse ela - até que amanheça! Não tenham medo dos ruídos
noturnos! Pois nada atravessa portas oujanelas aqui, a não ser o luar e a luz das
estrelas, e o vento que sopra da colina. Boa noite! Enquanto atravessava a sala, seu
vestido brilhava e farfalhava.

passos era como o de um riacho caindo suavemente colina abaixo, sobre pedras frescas na
quietude da noite.
Tom ficou por um tempo sentado em silêncio ao lado deles, enquanto cada um tentava criar
coragem para fazer alguma das muitas perguntas que
queriam ter feito durante
a ceia. O sono congestionava-lhes as pálpebras. Finalmente Frodo falou:
- Escutou meu chamado, Senhor, ou foi só o acaso que o trouxe naquele momento?
Tom se agitou, como se tivesse sido acordado de um sonho agradável.
- O quê? - disse ele. - Se ouvi seu chamado? Não, não ouvi. Estava ocupado, cantando. Foi
só o acaso que me levou até lá, se você chama isso de acaso. Não estava
nos meus planos, embora eu estivesse esperando vocês. Tivemos notícias suas, e soubemos
que estavam vagando pela região. Supusemos que logo desceriam até a água:
todas as trilhas conduzem a esse destino, descendo até o Voltavime. O Velho Salgueirohomem canta alto; escapar de suas garras hábeis é dificil para as pessoas pequenas.
Mas Tom tinha uma missão a cumprir, da qual não podia se esquivar. - Tom abaixou a
cabeça, como se o sono estivesse novamente tomando conta dele; mas continuou,
numa voz suave, cantando:
Tinha um serviço a fazer- nenúfares recolher,
folhas verdes eflores brancas, pra agradar minha senhora, os últimos
deste ano, antes de o inverno chegar,
para enfeitarseus pés, até o derreter das neves. No fim de cada verão, eu vou buscá-los
pra ela,
num lago largo,ftíndo e claro, nas margens do Voltavime; onde cedo na primavera e tarde
abrem no verão.
À beira do lago há muitos anos, achei a Filha do Rio,
a linda ejovem Fruta d'Ouro, sentada por entre osjuncos. Docemente então cantava e o
coração batia!
Abriu os olhos e olhou para eles com um súbito brilho azul.
E isso foi bom pra vocês; porque não mais hei de ir nas águas qfúndar, no meio
destafloresta,
durante este ano velho. Nem pretendo passar
pela casa do Velho Salgueiro, no início da primavera, não até a estação
feliz, quando a Filha do Rio dançando pelos caminhos vai nas águas se banhar
Ficou em silêncio de novo; mas Frodo não conseguiu deixar de fazer mais uma
pergunta: a que mais desejava ver respondida. - Conte-nos, Senhor,
#133
sobre o Salgueiro-homem. O que é ele? Já ouvi alguma coisa a respeito antes.
- Está certo - disse o velho. - Agora está na hora de descansar. Não é bom ouvir certas
coisas quando as sombras caem sobre o mundo. Durmam até amanhã cedo. Descansem
sobre os travesseiros! Não temam os ruídos da noite! Não tenham medo de nenhum salgueiro
cinzento! - Com isso pegou a lamparina e a apagou, e, segurando uma vela
em cada mão, conduziu os hobbits até seu aposento.
Os colchões e travesseiros eram macios e fundos, e os cobertores de lã branca. Mal se
deitaram nas camas fofas, puxando as leves cobertas, e já estavam dormindo.
Na calada da noite, Frodo teve um sonho sem luz. Via agora a lua nova nascendo; sob sua
luz
tênue aparecia diante dele uma parede negra de pedra, perfurada por um
arco escuro que parecia um portão. Frodo tinha a impressão de estar sendo erguido, e
passando pelo arco descobriu que a parede de pedra era um círculo de colinas,
e que no centro dele ficava uma planície, no meio da qual se levantava um pináculo de
pedra, semelhante a uma enorme torre, mas obra da natureza. No topo estava
a figura de um homem. A lua, galgando o céu, pareceu parar por um momento sobre a cabeça
deste homem, reluzindo nos cabelos brancos que o vento agitava. Subindo

da planície escura vinha o grito de vozes cruéis, e o uivo de muitos lobos. De repente,
uma sombra, na forma de grandes asas, passou cobrindo a lua. A figura levantou
os braços e uma luz emanou do cajado que segurava. Uma águia enorme deu um vôo rasante e
a carregou para longe. As vozes gemeram e os lobos uivaram se lamentando.
Um som, como de ventania, trouxe o ruído de cascos, galopando, galopando, galopando,
vindo do Leste. "Cavaleiros Negros!", pensou Frodo enquanto acordava, ainda
com o som de cascos ecoando em sua cabeça. Perguntou-se então se teria coragem de
abandonar a segurança daquelas paredes de pedra. Permaneceu imóvel, ainda escutando;
mas tudo agora estava no mais absoluto silêncio, e finalmente ele se virou e adormeceu
novamente, ou vagou em algum outro sonho do qual não se recordou depois.
Ao lado, Pippin sonhava tranqüilo; mas algo mudou em seus sonhos e ele começou a se
agitar e a resmungar. De repente acordou, ou pensou ter acordado; mas mesmo assim
ainda escutava na escuridão o som que perturbara seus sonhos: tipe-tape, esquique: o som
era como o de vento agitando galhos, dedos de árvores arranhando parede
e janela: crique, crique, crique. Ficou imaginando se havia salgueiros perto da casa; e
então de repente teve a terrível impressão de não estar numa casa comum,
mas dentro do salgueiro e escutando aquela horrível voz chiada, rindo dele novamente.
Sentou-se, e sentiu as mãos afundando nos travesseiros fofos, e então se
#134
deitou de novo, aliviado. Teve a impressão de escutar o eco das palavras: "Nada tema!
Fique em paz até amanhã cedo! Não tenha medo dos ruídos noturnos!" Então adormeceu
novamente.
Foi o barulho da água que Merry escutou em seu sono tranqüilo: água fluindo suave, e
depois se espalhando irresistivelmente por toda a volta da casa, num lago escuro
e sem margens. Borbulhava sob as paredes e subia, devagar mas de um modo que não deixava
dúvidas. "Vou me afogar!", pensou ele. "A água vai penetrar as paredes e
invadir a casa, e então vou me afogar." Pareceu-lhe que estava deitado sobre um brejo
lodoso, e ao se levantar colocou o pé no canto de uma pedra fria e dura que
revestia o chão. Então lembrou onde estava e deitou-se novamente. Teve a impressão de
escutar ou de se lembrar das palavras: "Nada atravessa estas portas e janelas
a não ser o luar e a luz das estrelas, e o vento que sopra da colina." Um pequeno sopro
doce de ar moveu a cortina. Merry respirou fundo e adormeceu de novo.
Pelo que pôde se lembrar, Sam dormiu toda a noite completamente feliz, se é que as pedras
ficam felizes.
Acordaram, todos os quatro de uma vez, com a luz do dia. Tom andava pelo quarto de um
lado para o outro, assobiando como um passarinho. Quando os ouviu se movimentando,
bateu palmas e gritou: - Bela boneca, feliz neneca! Venham, meus queridos! - Afastou as
cortinas amarelas, e os hobbits puderam então ver que elas cobriam duas janelas,
dos dois lados do quarto, uma se abrindo para o leste, e a outra para o oeste.
Levantaram-se reanimados. Frodo correu para a janela leste, e se viu olhando para uma
horta coberta de orvalho. De certa maneira, tinha esperado ver um terreno coberto
de turfa estendendo-se até as paredes, turfa toda marcada por cascos. Na verdade, sua
visão era mediada por um canteiro de pés de feijão altos, apoiados em estacas;
mas acima e adiante o topo cinzento da colina assomava contra a luz do sol nascente. A
manhã estava clara: a leste, atrás de compridas nuvens que pareciam fios de
lã com as pontas manchadas de vermelho, brilhava uma tonalidade profunda de amarelo.
O céu anunciava chuva, mas a luz se espalhava rapidamente, e as flores vermelhas
dos pés de feijão começaram a brilhar, contrastando com as folhas verdes e úmidas.
Pippin olhava, através da janela oeste, para um lago de névoa. A Floresta se escondia sob
a neblina. Era como um teto de nuvens visto de cima. Havia uma vala ou
canal, onde a névoa se partia em muitas ondas de plumas; o vale do Voltavime.
O córrego descia pelo lado esquerdo da colina, e mergulhava nas sombras brancas. Bem
próximo ficava um canteiro de flores e uma cerca-viva podada e enredada em prata; atrás
da cerca via-se um gramado bem cortado, que a névoa coloria de um cinza-claro.
Não se via nenhum salgueiro.

- Bom dia, alegres amigos! - gritou Tom, abrindo totalmente a janela leste. Uma brisa
fresca entrou, com um cheiro de chuva. O sol não vai mostrar sua cara hoje,
eu acho. Estive andando por aí, pulando nos topos das colinas, desde o início desta
aurora cinzenta, sentindo o cheiro do vento e do tempo, com capim molhado sob
os pés, céu molhado sobre a cabeça. Para acordar Fruta d'Ouro, cantei embaixo da janela;
mas nada acorda os hobbits de manhã cedinho. Durante a noite, as pessoas
pequenas acordam em meio à escuridão, mas depois que a luz chega, continuam dormindo!
Dingue-dongue não delongue! Acordem agora, meus alegres amigos! Esqueçam os
ruídos noturnos. Dingue-dongue-dilo, meus queridos! Se vierem logo, encontrarão a mesa do
desjejum posta. Se demorarem, só terão capim molhado e água de chuva.
Não precisou falar duas vezes - embora a ameaça de Tom não soasse muito séria - os
hobbits se apressaram, e só deixaram a mesa depois de um tempo razoável, quando
ela começava a parecer vazia. Nem Tom nem Fruta d'Ouro estiveram presentes. Podia-se
ouvir Tom pela casa, fazendo barulho na cozinha, e subindo e descendo a escada,
cantando dentro e fora. A sala dava para o oeste, debruçando-se sobre o vale coberto de
névoa, e a janela estava aberta. Gotas de água pingavam dos beirais de sapé
acima deles. Antes que tivessem terminado o desjejum, um teto inteiriço de nuvens se
formou, e uma chuva vertical cinzenta começou a cair suave e continuamente.
Atrás dessa cortina de chuva, a Floresta ficava completamente oculta.
Ao olharem pela janela, os hobbits ouviram descendo pelo ar, como se acompanhasse a chuva
vinda do céu, a voz cristalina de Fruta d'Ouro, cantando no pavimento acima
deles. Quase não conseguiam entender as palavras, mas parecia claro que era uma canção de
chuva, doce como o cair da água sobre topos de colinas secas; a canção
contava a história de um rio, desde que minava nas montanhas até chegar ao Mar bem
abaixo. Os hobbits escutavam deliciados; Frodo sentia alegria no coração, agradecendo
ao tempo camarada que atrasava sua partida. A idéia de partir tinha-lhe pesado no coração
desde a hora que acordara, mas agora supunha que não iriam naquele dia.
O vento alto se acalmou no oeste, e nuvens mais espessas e úmidas se formaram, para
derramar sua carga de chuva nas cabeças calvas das Colinas. Não se via nada em
volta da casa a não ser água caindo. Frodo parou perto da porta aberta e ficou observando
a trilha caiada se transformar num pequeno rio de leite, e depois correr
borbulhando até o vale. Tom Bombadil veio aos pulinhos do canto da casa, acenando com os
braços como se estivesse mandando a chuva embora - e de fato, quando pulou
sobre a soleira,
#136

parecia estar seco, com exceção de suas botas. Estas ele tirou e colocou no canto da
chaminé. Então sentou-se na maior poltrona, chamando os hobbits para se reunirem
à sua volta.
- Hoje é o dia de Fruta d'Ouro lavar tudo - disse ele. - O dia de limpeza do outono.
Molhado demais para hobbits - que eles descansem enquando podem. É um bom dia
para histórias longas, e para perguntas e respostas, por isso Tom vai começar a conversa.
Contou-lhes então muitas histórias notáveis, às vezes quase como se as estivesse contando
para si mesmo, outras vezes olhando-os de repente com
um brilho azul no
olhar, debaixo das grossas sobrancelhas. Freqüentemente sua voz virava uma canção, e ele
se levantava da poltrona para dançar pela sala. Contou-lhes histórias de
abelhas e flores, do jeito de ser das árvores e das estranhas criaturas da Floresta,
sobre coisas más e coisas boas, coisas amigas e hostis, coisas cruéis e gentis,
e sobre segredos escondidos sob os arbustos espinhosos.
Conforme escutavam, os hobbits passaram a entender a vida da Floresta, separada deles; na
realidade, até começaram a se sentir estranhos, num lugar onde todos os

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
outros elementos estavam em casa. Entrando e saindo da conversa, sempre estava o Velho
Salgueiro-homem, e Frodo pôde aprender o suficiente para satisfazer sua curiosidade,
na verdade mais que suficiente, pois o assunto não era fácil. As palavras de Tom
desnudavam
o coração e o pensamento das árvores, que sempre eram obscuros e estranhos,
cheios de um ódio pelas coisas que circulam livres sobre a terra, roendo, mordendo,
quebrando, cortando, queimando: destruidores e usurpadores. A Floresta Velha
tinha esse nome não sem motivo, pois era realmente antiga, sobrevivente de florestas
vastas já esquecidas; e nela ainda viviam, com a idade das próprias colinas,
os pais dos pais das árvores, relembrando o tempo em que eram senhores. Os anos
incontáveis tínham-nos enchido de orgulho e sabedoria arraigada, e também de malícia.
Mas nenhum deles era mais perigoso que o Grande Salgueiro: este tinha o coração
apodrecido, mas a força ainda era verde; era habilidoso, senhor dos ventos,
e sua canção e pensamento corriam a floresta dos dois lados do rio. Seu sedento espírito
cinza retirou da terra o poder, que se espalhou como raizes finas no solo,
e invisíveis dedos-ramos no ar, chegando a dominar quase todas as árvores da Floresta, da
Cerca até as Colinas.
De repente a conversa de Tom abandonou a floresta e foi pulando, subindo pelo jovem
córrego, sobre cascatas borbulhantes, sobre seixos e pedras gastas, e por entre
pequenas flores no capim fechado e gretas molhadas, vagando finalmente até as Colinas.
Ouviram então sobre os Grandes Túmulos e os morros verdes e os anéis de pedra
sobre as colinas e nas baixadas entre as colinas. Rebanhos de ovelhas baliam. Paredes
verdes e brancas
#137
se ergueram. Havia fortalezas nas alturas. Reis de pequenos reinados
lutaram entre si, e o Sol jovem brilhava como fogo no metal vermelho de suas espadas
novas
e gananciosas. Houve vitória e derrota; torres caíram, fortalezas foram queimadas, e as
chamas subiram pelo céu. Empilhou-se ouro nos ataúdes dos reis e rainhas
mortos; e a terra os cobriu, e as portas de pedra se fecharam; o capim cresceu e cobriu
tudo. Por um tempo, as ovelhas circularam, comendo o capim, mas logo as colinas
estavam de novo desertas. Uma sombra veio de lugares distantes e escuros,
e os
ossos se mexeram dentro dos túmulos. Criaturas Tumulares andavam pelas cavidades
com um tilintar de anéis em dedos frios e correntes de ouro ao vento. Os anéis de pedra
sorriam no chão como dentes quebrados ao luar.
Os hobbits tremeram. Até no Condado, os rumores sobre as Criaturas Tumulares das Colinas
dos Túmulos além da Floresta já tinham sido ouvidos. Mas essa história nenhum
hobbit gostava de escutar, mesmo num lugar confortável ao lado do fogo, e bem distante.
Esses quatro de repente lembraram-se das coisas que a alegria daquela casa
tinha afastado de suas mentes: a casa de Tom Bombadil se aninhava bem ali, em meio
àquelas
terríveis colinas. Perderam o fio da história e se agitaram inquietos,
olhando uns para os outros,
Quando voltaram a acompanhar as palavras de Tom, perceberam que ele tinha enveredado por
estranhas regiões além de suas memórias e de seu pensamento consciente,
para tempos em que o mundo era mais vasto, e os mares fluíam direto para a Praia do
ocidente; Tom ainda se movia de um lado para o outro, cantando luzes de estrelas
antigas, de uma época em que apenas os ancestrais dos elfos estavam acordados. Então, de
repente, parou, e eles viram que sua cabeça caía, como se estivesse adormecendo.
Os hobbits continuaram quietos diante dele, encantados; parecia que, como se sob o
encanto de suas palavras, o vento tivesse ido embora e as nuvens tivessem secado,
o dia se retirava, com a escuridão vinda do leste e do oeste, e todo o céu ficou repleto
da luz de estrelas brancas.
Frodo não sabia dizer se havia passado ali a manhã e a tarde de um dia ou de muitos dias.
Não se sentia faminto ou cansado, apenas maravilhado. As estrelas brilhavam

através dajanela e o silêncio do céu parecia estar por toda a sua volta. Finalmente
falou, saindo de seu
encantamento, com um medo repentino daquele silêncio.
- Quem é o Senhor? - perguntou ele.
- O quê? - disse Tom, ajeitando-se na poltrona, os olhos brilhando na escuridão. - Ainda
não sabe meu nome? Esta é a única resposta. Diga-me, quem é você, sozinho
e sem nome? Mas voce e jovem e eu sou velho. Mais ancião, é o que sou. Vejam bem, meus
amigos: Tom Bombadiljá estava aqui antes do rio e das árvores; Tom se lembra
da primeira gota de chuva e do
#138
primeiro broto de árvore. Fez trilhas antes das pessoas grandes, e viu o povo pequeno
chegando. Já estava aqui antes dos Reis e dos túmulos e das Criaturas Tumulares.
Quando os elfos passaram para o oeste, Tom já estava, antes de os mares serem encurvados.
Conheceu o escuro sob as estrelas quando não havia medo - antes de o Senhor
do Escuro chegar de Fora.
Uma sombra pareceu passar pela janela, e os hobbits olharam rapidamente naquela direção.
Quando se viraram de novo, Fruta d'Ouro estava na porta atrás deles, emoldurada
de luz. Segurava uma vela, protegendo a chama com a mão contra a corrente de ar, e a luz
fluía através dela, como flui a luz do sol através de uma concha branca.
- A chuva passou - disse ela - e novas águas correm colina abaixo, sob as estrelas. Vamos
rir e nos alegrar.
- E vamos comer e beber! - gritou Tom. - Histórias compridas são sedentas, e escutá-las é
um trabalho que dá fome, de manhã, à tarde e à noite!
- Com isso pulou da poltrona, e com um movimento do corpo pegou uma vela da guarda da
chaminé, acendendo-a na chama que Fruta d'Ouro segurava; então dançou em volta
da mesa. De repente, atravessou a porta pulando e desapareceu.
Logo voltou, trazendo uma bandeja grande e carregada. Tom e Fruta d'Ouro puseram a mesa;
os hobbits ficaram sentados, ao mesmo tempo encantados e rindo: pela extrema
beleza e graça de Fruta d'Ouro e pela alegria e esquisitice das cabriolagens de Tom.
Contudo, parecia que de alguma maneira eles dançavam a mesma dança, nenhum atrapalhando
o outro, os dois entrando e saindo e circulando em volta da mesa; rapidamente, comida,
vasilhas e luzes foram colocadas em ordem. A madeira refletia a luz das velas,
brancas e amarelas. Tom fez uma reverência diante dos convidados.
- A ceia está pronta! - disse Fruta d'Ouro; e os hobbits então puderam ver que ela estava
vestida de prateado, com um cinto branco, e seus sapatos pareciam de escama
de peixe. Mas Tom estava todo de azul-claro, o azul de miosótis recém-banhados pela
chuva, e usava meias verdes.
A ceia foi ainda melhor que a anterior. Os hobbits, sob o encantamento das palavras de
Tom, poderiam ter perdido uma ou muitas refeições, mas com a comida diante
deles parecia que não comiam havia pelo menos uma semana. Não cantaram e nem falaram por
um período, prestando muita atenção ao que estavam fazendo. Mas depois de
algum tempo, seus corações e espíritos se elevaram novamente, e suas vozes soaram com
jovialidade e alegria.
Depois de comerem, Fruta d'Ouro cantou varias cançoes para eles, canções que começavam
alegremente nas colinas e desciam suaves até o silêncio; e durante o silêncio,
eles viam em suas mentes lagos e águas mais
#139
amplos do que jamais tinham visto, e olhando para esses lagos viam o céu sob seus pés, e
as estrelas como jóias nas profundezas. Então, ela desejoulhes boa-noite
mais uma vez, deixando-os perto da lareira. Mas agora Tom parecia totalmente acordado, e
os cobriu de perguntas.
Parecia já saber muito sobre eles e suas famílias, e na verdade também sobre toda a
história e afazeres do Condado, desde os tempos que os próprios hobbits mal lembravam.

Isso não os surpreendeu, mas Tom não escondeu que seu conhecimento se devia, em grande
parte, ao velho Magote, aparentemente mais importante do que eles tinham imaginado.
- Há terra sob seus velhos pés, e barro em seus dedos; sabedoria nos ossos, e ele tem os
dois olhos abertos - disse Tom. Também ficou claro que Tom tinha relações
com os elfos, e parecia que, de algum modo, notícias da fuga de Frodo tinham chegado até
ele através de Gildor.
E de fato, tanto sabia Tom, e tão habilidosas eram suas perguntas, que Frodo se viu
contando a ele mais sobre
Bilbo, e suas proprias esperanças e temores do que
jamais contara a alguém, até mesmo a Gandalf.
- Mostre-me o precioso Anel! - disse ele de repente, em meio à história: e Frodo, para
a própria surpresa, puxou a corrente do bolso, e soltando dela o Anel,
entregou-o imediatamente a Tom.
O Anel pareceu crescer por um momento naquela grande mão morena. Então, de repente, Tom
ergueu-o na altura dos olhos e riu. Por um segundo os hobbits tiveram uma
visão, cômica e alarmante, de seu olho azul brilhando através do círculo de ouro. Depois
Tom colocou o Anel na ponta de seu dedo mínimo, levando-o para perto da
luz da vela. Por um momento, os hobbits não perceberam nada de estranho a respeito disso.
Então ficaram pasmos. Nenhum sinal de Tom desaparecer.
Tom riu de novo, e jogou o Anel para os ares - e ele sumiu num clarão. Frodo soltou um
grito - e Tom se inclinou para frente, devolvendo o Anel com um sorriso.
Frodo examinou-o de perto, com grande suspeita (como alguém que tivesse emprestado uma
jóia a um ilusionista). Era o mesmo Anel, ou parecia ser o mesmo, com o mesmo
peso: pois Frodo sempre tivera a impressão de que aquele Anel pesava na mão de modo
estranho. Mas algo o forçava a se certificar. Talvez estivesse um pouquinho
zangado com Tom, por dar tão pouca importância ao que até Gandalf considerava tão
perigosamente importante. Esperou pela oportunidade, quando a conversa continuava,
e Tom estava contando uma história absurda sobre os texugos e seus estranhos hábitos nesse momento, colocou o Anel.
Merry virou-se para ele para dizer alguma coisa e levou um susto, contendo uma
exclamação. Frodo estava deliciado (de certo modo): era mesmo o seu Anel, pois Merry
olhava estupefato para a poltrona, e obviamente não
#140
conseguia enxergá-lo. Frodo se levantou e andou em silêncio, da lareira até a porta de
entrada.
- Você aí! - gritou Tom, olhando em direção a ele com um olhar de quem enxerga
perfeitamente: - Ei! Venha, Frodo! Aonde você está indo?
O velho Tom Bombadil ainda não está tão cego assim. Tire seu Anel de ouro. Sua mão fica
mais bonita sem ele. Volte! Largue dessa brincadeira e sente-se de novo ao meu lado!
Temos de conversar
um pouco mais, e pensar sobre amanhã cedo. Tom precisa lhe ensinar a estrada certa, para
evitar que se perca.
Frodo riu (tentando se sentir satisfeito), e tirando o Anel voltou e se sentou de novo.
Tom agora dizia que achava provável que o sol aparecesse no dia seguinte,
e que a manhã seria alegre, e que poderiam ter boas esperanças ao partir. Mas deviam ir
cedo; pois o tempo naquela região era uma coisa sobre a qual nem mesmo Tom
tinha certeza, e algumas vezes mudava antes que ele pudesse trocar de jaqueta. - Não sou
o senhor do tempo - disse ele bem como não o é nenhum ser de duas pernas.
Seguindo seus conselhos, decidiram rumar o máximo possível para o norte saindo da casa,
sobre as encostas mais baixas do lado oeste das Colinas: dessa forma, poderiam
ter esperanças de alcançar a Estrada Leste num dia de viagem, e evitar os Túmulos. Tom
disse que não tivessem medo mas que cuidassem de suas próprias obrigações.
- Não saiam do capim verde. Não vão se misturar com pedras velhas ou com as Criaturas
geladas, nem se intrometer em suas casas, a não ser que sejam pessoas fortes,
com corações que nada temem! - Disse isso mais de uma vez e aconselhou-os a passar pelos
Túmulos do lado oeste, se por acaso se aproximassem de um deles. Então ensinou-lhes

uma rima para cantar, se por azar ficassem em perigo ou n'algum tipo de dificuldade no
dia seguinte.
Ei! Tom Bombadillo, Tom Bombadil!
Na mata ou na colina oujunto à margem do rio, Nofogo, ao sol e à lua, ouve agora nossa
voz! Vem, Tom Bombadil, que no aperto estamos sós!
Depois de cantarem isso juntos, Tom deu tapinhas nos ombros de cada um deles com um
sorriso, e levando as velas conduziu-os de volta para o quarto.

#141
CAPíTULO VIII
NEBLINA SOBRE AS COLINAS DOS TúMULOS

Naquela noite não escutaram ruídos. Frodo porém não podia dizer com certeza se foi em
sonhos ou acordado, que ouviu uma doce voz cantando em sua mente: uma canção
que vinha como uma luz pálida atrás de uma cortina de chuva cinzenta, a voz crescendo até
transformar aquele véu chuvoso em cristal e prata, para depois se distanciar,
revelando aos olhos um campo muito verde sob a luz do sol.
A visão se desmanchou com o despertar, e ali estava Tom, assobiando como um bando de
pássaros; o sol já subia atrás da colina, emitindo luz através da janela. Lá
fora, a paisagem estava verde e dourada.
Depois do desjejum, que novamente tomaram sozinhos, os hobbits se prepararam para dizer
adeus, sentindo nos corações o peso que permitia uma manhã como aquela: fresca,
clara e limpa sob um céu lavado de outono, de um azul tênue. Uma brisa fresca soprava do
noroeste. Os tranqüilos pôneis já estavam quase ariscos, farejando e se
mexendo inquietos. Tom saiu da casa e acenou com o chapéu, depois dançou na porta de
entrada, dizendo que os hobbits deveriam se levantar e partir, e em boa velocidade.
Saíram cavalgando ao longo de uma trilha sinuosa que vinha de trás da casa, inclinando-se
numa subida em direção ao topo da colina no lado norte, onde desaparecia.
Tinham acabado de descer dos pôneis para conduzi-los pela última ladeira íngreme, quando
de repente Frodo parou.
- Fruta d'Ouro - gritou ele. - Minha linda senhora, toda vestida de verde-prata! Não lhe
dissemos adeus, nem a vimos desde ontem à noite! Estava tão perturbado que
já ia voltando; mas naquele momento um chamado, uma voz cristalina, desceu ondulando
colina abaixo. Ali, no topo, estava ela, acenando para eles: os cabelos esvoaçavam
soltos, e, conforme captavam a luz do sol, brilhavam e reluziam. Uma luz como o brilho da
água sobre a grama orvalhada vinha de seus pés, enquanto dançava.
Os hobbits correram ladeira acima, e pararam sem fôlego ao lado dela. Fizeram
reverências, mas, com um aceno de braço, ela pediu que olhassem em volta; ali, no topo
da colina, puderam ver a paisagem sob a luz da manhã. Agora tudo estava claro e podia-se
enxergar longe. Na vinda, quando tinham parado no outeiro da Floresta, quase
não puderam enxergar nada, por causa da névoa que lhes velava a visão, mas agora o
outeiro aparecia, erguendo-se claro e verde por entre as árvores escuras do oeste.
Naquela direção, o terreno coberto de vegetação se levantava em cordilheiras verdes,
#142
amarelas, avermelhadas sob o sol. Atrás delas se escondia o vale do Brandevin. Ao sul,
sobre a linha do Voltavime, havia um brilho distante, como de vidro claro,
no ponto em que o rio Brandevin fazia uma grande curva no terreno mais baixo, para depois
correr para regiões desconhecidas dos hobbits. Ao norte, além das colinas
que iam sumindo, a terra fugia em espaços planos e protuberâncias cinzentas, verdes e cor
de terra, até desaparecer na distância sombria e sem forma. Ao leste, as
Colinas dos Túmulos se erguiam, topo atrás de topo dentro da manhã, sumindo da visão numa
conjectura: não passava de uma conjectura azul, com pontos de um branco

remoto, que se misturava ao céu no horizonte, mas que mesmo assim falava-lhes das
montanhas altas e distantes, presentes na memória de antigas histórias.
Encheram os pulmões de ar, sentindo que um salto e alguns passos largos os levariam aonde
quisessem. Parecia fraqueza de espírito irem andando em direção à estrada
ao longo das bordas enrugadas das montanhas, quando na verdade deveriam ir aos pulos, com
o mesmo vigor de Tom, sobre os degraus de pedra das colinas, diretamente
até as Montanhas.
Fruta d'Ouro dirigiu-lhes a palavra, chamando sobre si seus olhares e pensamentos. Apressem-se agora, belos convidados! - disse ela. - E continuem firmes em seus
propósitos! Rumo ao norte com o vento no olho esquerdo, e sorte em seus passos! Apressemse enquanto o sol brilha. - E para Frodo, ela disse: - Adeus, amigo-dos-elfos,
foi um encontro feliz!
Mas Frodo não teve palavras para responder. Fez uma grande reverência, montou o pônei e,
seguido pelos amigos, avançou lentamente, pela descida suave atrás da colina.
Perderam de vista a casa de Tom Bombadil e o vale, e depois a Floresta.
O ar ficou mais quente entre as paredes verdes formadas pelas encostas das colinas; o
cheiro
da turfa subia forte e doce. Voltando-se, ao atingirem o fundo do vale verde, viram Fruta
d'Ouro, agora pequena e esguia como uma flor ensolarada contra o céu: ainda
estava ali, olhando-os, com as mãos estendidas na direção deles. No momento em que
olharam, saudou-os com a voz cristalina, e levantando a mão virou-se e sumiu atrás
da colina.
O caminho se estendia sinuoso ao longo do fundo do vale, volteando a base verde de uma
colina íngreme, para depois chegar a outro vale mais amplo e mais fundo, continuando
através das saliências de outras colinas, descendo pelas bordas longas, subindo de novo
pelas encostas suaves, chegando a novos topos e descendo outros vales. Não
se via árvore ou qualquer sinal de água: o território era de capim e turfa curta e macia;
tudo era silêncio, a não ser pelo sussurro do ar e por gritos agudos e
solitários de aves estranhas. Conforme continuavam, o sol subia e o calor aumentava. Cada
vez que atingiam um topo, tinham a impressão de que a brisa diminuía. Quando
#143
olhavam em direção ao oeste, a Floresta distante parecia estar fumegando,
como se a chuva que caíra estivesse subindo vaporizada, das folhas, raizes e do solo.
Agora uma sombra envolvia o horizonte, uma névoa escura sobre a qual o céu parecia um
chapéu azul, quente e pesado.
Por volta de meio-dia, chegaram a uma colina cujo topo era amplo e achatado, como um
prato raso com uma borda verde e elevada. Ali dentro o ar estava parado, e parecia
que o céu estava perto de suas cabeças. Atravessaram o topo para olhar para o norte.
Então os corações se alegraram, pois parecia óbvio que já tinham avançado mais
do que esperavam. Sabiam que as distâncias agora ficavam nebulosas e incertas, mas não
havia dúvida de que as Colinas estavam chegando ao fim. Um vale comprido se
estendia lá embaixo, descrevendo curvas em direção ao norte, até chegar a uma abertura
entre duas encostas íngremes. Adiante, parecia não haver mais colinas. Ao
norte mal se podia enxergar uma linha longa e escura. -Aquela é uma fileira de árvores disse Merry - que deve estar demarcando a Estrada. Ao longo dela, por muitas
léguas a leste da ponte, há árvores crescendo. Dizem que foram plantadas antigamente.
- Esplêndido! - disse Frodo. - Se conseguirmos avançar bastante esta tarde como fizemos
de manhã, já teremos deixado as Colinas antes de o sol se pôr, e então poderemos
caminhar à procura de um lugar para acampar. Mas no momento em que falava, olhou para o
leste, e percebeu que daquele lado as colinas eram mais altas, e olhavam-nos
de cima; e todas aquelas colinas estavam cobertas por montículos verdes, alguns deles com
pedras fincadas, que apontavam para o céu como dentes afiados em gengivas
verdes.
A paisagem tinha algo de perturbador, por isso eles se viraram e desceram para dentro do
círculo côncavo. No meio dele ficava uma única pedra, que se erguia sob

o sol, e que naquela hora não projetava sombras. Não tinha um formato definido, mas
parecia ter um significado: como um marco, ou um dedo guardião ou, mais ainda,
um aviso. Mas eles estavam famintos, e ainda era meio-dia, hora que espanta os temores;
resolveram se encostar na pedra, do lado leste. Era fria, como se o sol não
tivesse o poder de aquecê-la; mas naquele momento isso pareceu agradável. Ali comeram e
beberam; fizeram a melhor refeição ao ar livre que se poderia desejar, pois
a comida vinha de "lá de baixo da Colina". Tom tinha arranjado o suficiente para passarem
bem o dia. Os pôneis, descarregados, passeavam pela grama.
A cavalgada sobre as Colinas e a refeição pesada, o sol morno, o cheiro da turfa, o longo
tempo que ficaram deitados, esticando as pernas e olhando o céu lá em cima:
talvez essas coisas sejam o suficiente para explicar o que aconteceu. De qualquer modo,
foi assim que aconteceu: acordaram de súbito e perturbados de um sono que
nao estivera em seus planos. A pedra
#144
fincada estava fria, projetando uma sombra comprida e pálida, que se estendia ao leste
sobre suas cabeças.
O sol, de um amarelo claro e aguado, brilhava através
da névoa logo acima da encosta oeste da concavidade em que estavam deitados; ao norte, ao
sul e ao leste, além da encosta, a neblina estava espessa, fria e branca.
O ar estava quieto, pesado e gelado. Os pôneis se encostavam uns nos outros, com as
cabeças para baixo.
Os hobbits pularam de pé, alarmados, e correram até a borda oeste. Descobriram que
estavam numa ilha em meio à neblina. Quando olharam tristes para o sol que se
punha, viram-no afundar diante de seus olhos num mar branco, e uma sombra fria e cinzenta
se espalhava no leste atrás deles. A neblina subia pelas encostas, ultrapassando
a altura de suas cabeças, até se tornar um telhado: estavam enclausurados num recinto de
neblina cujo ponto central era a pedra fincada.
Tiveram a impressão de que estavam sendo aprisionados numa armadilha, mas mesmo assim não
se desesperaram. Ainda podiam lembrar-se da visão que os enchera de esperanças,
da linha da Estrada, que ainda sabiam em que direção ficava. De qualquer modo, sentiam
agora tamanha repugnância por aquele lugar côncavo em volta da pedra, que
mal podiam pensar em ficar lá por mais tempo. Arrumaram as mochilas tão rápido quanto os
dedos gelados permitiram.
Logo estavam conduzindo os pôneis em fila indiana sobre a borda e pela longa encosta
norte da colina, mergulhando num mar de neblina. Conforme desciam, a névoa ficava
mais úmida e fria, e os cabelos lhes caíam murchos sobre a testa, gotejando. Quando
chegaram ao fundo do vale, estava tão frio que pararam e tiraram das mochilas
capas e capuzes, que em pouco tempo ficaram cobertos de gotas cinzentas. Depois, montados
nos pôneis, continuaram lentamente, adivinhando o caminho pelas subidas
e descidas do solo. Pelo que podiam imaginar, estavam rumando para a abertura em forma de
portão, na extremidade norte do longo vale, que tinham visto pela manhã.
Uma vez atravessada a abertura, só teriam de se manter em linha reta o máximo possível, e
no final era bem provável que atingissem a Estrada. Não conseguiam pensar
em mais nada além disso, mas tinham uma vaga esperança de que talvez, além das Colinas,
não houvesse neblina.
Avançavam muito devagar. Para evitar que se separassem e vagassem em direções distintas,
continuavam em fila indiana, e Frodo ia à frente. Sam estava logo atrás,
depois do qual vinha Pippin, seguido por Merry. O vale parecia não ter fim. De repente
Frodo viu um sinal auspicioso. Dos dois lados à frente, uma escuridão .assomava
por entre a névoa, e ele supôs que finalmente estavam se aproximando da abertura nas
colinas, o portão norte das Colinas dos Túmulos. Se passassem por ali, estariam
livres.

- Venham! Sigam-me! - gritou ele por sobre os ombros, e avançando rapidamente. Mas sua
esperança logo se transformou em preocupação e pânico. As manchas escuras
ficaram mais escuras, mas se encolheram; de repente viu, erguendo-se agourentas diante
dele e se inclinando levemente uma em direção à outra como os batentes de
uma porta sem trave, duas enormes pedras fincadas. Frodo não se lembrava de ter visto
nenhum sinal delas no vale, quando tinha olhado da colina Pela manhã. Antes
que percebesse já tinha passado entre elas: e no mesmo momento em que fez isso, foi
envolvido pela escuridão.
O pônei se afastou bufando e Frodo caiu. Quando olhou
para trás, descobriu que estava sozinho. Os outros não o tinham seguido.
- Sam! - gritou ele. - Pippin, Merry! Venham! Por que não me acompanham?
Não houve resposta. Foi tomado pelo medo e correu para trás, atravessando as duas pedras
e gritando, desesperado: - Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!
- O pônei disparou dentro da névoa e desapareceu. A certa distância, ou pelo menos assim
parecia, Frodo pensou ter escutado um grito: - Ei! Frodo! Ei! - A voz parecia
vir do leste, à sua esquerda. Ele estava parado, ao lado das grandes pedras, fazendo um
enorme esforço para enxergar na escuridão. Mergulhou em direção ao chamado,
e percebeu que estava subindo uma encosta íngreme.
Avançando com esforço, ele chamou de novo, e continuou chamando cada vez mais
freneticamente, mas ficou sem resposta por um tempo; depois começou a ouvir um chamado
fraco, que parecia distante e bem acima de onde estava: - Frodo! Ei! - gritavam vozes
sumidas dentro da névoa: e então um grito, como socorro, socorro! várias vezes
repetido, terminando num último socorro! se perdeu, como um longo lamento interrompido.
Frodo avançou aos tropeços, com toda a velocidade que conseguia, em direção
aos gritos; mas a luz do dia se extinguira, e a noite se fechou ao seu redor, o que
tornava impossível ter certeza de qualquer direção. Tinha a impressão de estar
sempre subindo.
Apenas a mudança no nível do solo a seus pés lhe avisou quando finalmente chegou ao topo
de uma encosta ou colina. Estava cansado e suado, e apesar disso gelado.
A escuridão era total.
- Onde estão vocês? - gritou ele arrasado.
Não houve resposta. Ficou quieto, escutando. De repente percebeu que estava ficando muito
frio, e que no ponto alto em que se encontrava o vento começava a soprar,
frio como gelo. Uma mudança se operava no tempo. A névoa passava por ele agora, em trapos
e farrapos. Sua respiração produzia fumaça, e a escuridão estava menos
proxima e densa. Olhou para cima e
#146
viu, surpreso, que estrelas apagadas apareciam no céu, por entre chumaços apressados de
nuvem e neblina.
O vento começou a chiar sobre o capim.
De repente imaginou ter ouvido um grito abafado, e foi em direção a ele; enquanto
avançava, a névoa começou a subir e a se desvanecer, descobrindo o céu estrelado.
Um olhar rápido revelou que estava agora olhando para o sul, e sobre o topo redondo de
uma colina, a qual provavelmente subira vindo do norte. À sua direita, erguia-se
contra as estrelas do oeste uma figura escura. Ali estava um grande túmulo.
- Onde vocês estão? - gritou ele novamente, com raiva e medo. -Aqui! - disse uma voz,
profunda e fria, que parecia vir do solo. - Estou esperando você!
- Não! - disse Frodo; mas não fugiu. Os joelhos enfraqueceram, e ele caiu no chão. Nada
aconteceu, e não houve nenhum ruído. Tremendo, Frodo olhou para cima, em
tempo de ver uma figura alta e escura, como uma sombra contra as estrelas, se inclinando
sobre ele. Pensou ter visto dois olhos, muito frios, embora iluminados por
uma luz pálida, que parecia vir de alguma distância remota. Então alguma coisa o prendeu,
mais forte e mais fria que ferro.
O toque frio congelou seus ossos, e ele
perdeu os sentidos.

Quando voltou a si, por um momento não podia lembrar de nada, a não ser de uma sensação
de terror. Então, de repente, percebeu que estava aprisionado, irremediavelmente
preso; estava num túmulo. Tinha sido pego por uma das Criaturas Tumulares, e já estava
provavelmente subjugado aos terríveis encantamentos daquelas criaturas descritas
em histórias sussurradas. Não ousou se mexer, e ficou como estava quando acordou: deitado
de costas sobre uma pedra fria, com as mãos sobre o peito.
Mas, embora o medo fosse tão grande que parecia ser parte da própria escuridão que o
envolvia, Frodo se viu pensando em Bilbo Bolseiro e suas histórias, nas caminhadas
que faziam pelas alamedas do Condado, conversando sobre estradas e aventuras. Há uma
semente de coragem escondida (bem no fundo, é verdade) no coração do hobbit
mais gordo e mais tímido, aguardando algum perigo definitivo e desesperador que a faça
germinar. Frodo não era muito gordo, nem muito tímido; na verdade, embora
não soubesse disso, Bilbo (e Gandalf) o consideravam o melhor hobbit do Condado. Pensou
que tivesse chegado ao fim de sua aventura, um fim terrível, mas esse pensamento
renovou suas forças. Percebeu seus músculos se contraindo, como para um salto final;
deixara de se sentir frágil como uma vítima indefesa.
Enquanto estava ali deitado, pensando e tentando se controlar, percebeu de repente que a
escuridão cedia aos poucos: uma luz pálida e esverdeada crescia à sua volta.
Num primeiro momento não pôde ver em que tipo de
#147
lugar estava, pois a luz parecia emanar dele próprio, e do chão ao redor, e ainda não
tinha atingido o teto ou a parede. Virou-se, e na fria escuridão viu, deitados
ao lado, Sam, Pippin e Merry. Estavam de costas, com as faces totalmente pálidas, e
vestidos de branco. Ao redor deles estavam muitos tesouros, talvez de ouro,
embora naquela luz tivessem uma aparencia fria e desagradável. Diademas adornavam-lhes a
cabeça, correntes de ouro cobriam-lhes a cintura, e nos dedos tinham vários
anéis. Havia espadas perto deles, e escudos aos seus pés. Mas, atravessada sobre os três
pescoços, estava
uma longa espada desembainhada.
De repente, começou a soar uma canção: um murmúrio frio, que subia e descia de tom. A voz
parecia distante e infinitamente lúgubre, algumas vezes num tom alto e
agudo subindo pelo ar, outras como um gemido grave vindo do solo. Naquela cadeia disforme
de sons tristes e horríveis, seqüências de palavras tomavam forma uma vez
ou outra: tristes, duras, frias palavras, impiedosas e desprezíveis. A noite blasfemava
contra a manhã que lhe fora roubada, e o frio amaldiçoava o calor pelo qual
ansiava. Frodo estava congelado até os ossos. Depois de um tempo, a canção ficou mais
clara aos ouvidos, e, com o coração tomado de pavor, ele percebeu que a música
tinha se transformado num encantamento.
Frio hqja nas mãos, no coração e na espinha, e frio seja o sono sobre a pedra daninha:
que nunca despertem de seu pétreo leito,
nunca, até a Lua morta, até o Sol desfeito.
Ao soprar negro dos ventos os astros vão morrer. e eles sobre o ouro ainda irão Jazer,
até que o lorde escuro sua mão soerga sobre o mar morto e sobre a terra negra.
Atrás de sua cabeça, Frodo escutou o ruído de algo rangendo e arranhando, Levantando-se
sobre um dos braços, olhou e agora pôde ver na luz pálida que estavam num
tipo de corredor, que formava uma esquina atrás deles. Vindo da esquina, um longo braço
tateava, se aproximando, caminhando sobre os próprios dedos em díreção a
Sam, que estava mais próximo, e em direção ao cabo da espada que estava sobre ele.
Num primeiro momento, Frodo sentiu que de fato o encantamento o transformara em pedra.
Depois, teve um desejo alucinado de fugir. Imaginava se, colocando o Anel,
poderia escapar da Criatura Tumular e achar uma saída. Pensou em si mesmo correndo livre
sobre o capim, chorando Por Merry, Sam e Pippin, mas livre e vivo. Até Gandalf
admitiria que não havia mais nada a ser feito.

Mas a coragem despertada ficava cada vez mais forte: não poderia abandonar seus amigos
tão facilmente. Hesitou, tateando o bolso,-e lutou contra si mesmo de novo;
enquanto isso acontecia, o braço chegava mais perto. Subitamente, seu senso de
determinação ficou mais apurado, e ele agarrou uma pequena espada que jazia ao lado,
e ficando de joelhos agachou-se sobre os corpos dos companheiros. Com toda força que
tinha, golpeou o braço rastejante na região do pulso, e a mão caiu decepada:
mas nesse mesmo momento, a espada se estilhaçou até o punho. Houve um grito agudo e a luz
desapareceu. No escuro, ouvia-se o ruído de algo rosnando.
Frodo caiu para frente sobre Merry, sentindo seu rosto gelado. Imediatamente voltou à sua
mente, de onde tinha se ausentado logo que a neblina começara, a memória
da casa lá embaixo da Colina, e de Tom cantando. Lembrou-se da rima que Tom tinha lhe
ensinado. Numa voz fraca e desesperada, começou: Ei, Tom
Bombadillo! e, ao
pronunciar aquele nome, a voz pareceu ficar mais forte: produzia agora um som forte e
vigoroso, e a câmara escura parecia ecoar tambores e cornetas.
Ei! Tom Bombadillo, Tom Bombadil!
Na mata ou na colina oujunto à margem do rio, Nojogo, ao sol e à lua, ouve agora nossa
voz! Vem, Tom Bombadil, que no aperto estamos sós!
Fez-se um silêncio súbito e profundo, durante o qual Frodo podia escutar seu coração
batendo. Depois de um momento longo e lento, escutou claramente, embora distante,
como se viesse de baixo da terra ou através de espessas paredes, uma voz que,
respondendo, cantava:
O velho Tom Bombadil é mesmo um bom camarada; Azul-claro é suajaqueta e sua bota é
amarelada. Ninguém jamais o apanha porque Tom é mais sabido; Sua canção tem mais
poder e seu pé é mais rápido.
Houve um som retumbante, como de pedras rolando e caindo, e de repente a câmara foi
iluminada, por uma luz real, a luz do dia. Uma pequena abertura semelhante a
uma porta apareceu na extremidade da câmara além dos pés de Frodo; e ali estava a cabeça
de Tom (com chapéu, pena e tudo o mais) recortada pela luz do sol que nascia
vermelho atrás dela. A luz atingiu o solo e os rostos dos três hobbits deitados ao lado
de Frodo. Eles não se mexeram, mas a tonalidade doentia desapareceu de suas
faces. Agora parecia que estavam apenas dormindo profundamente.
#149
Tom se abaixou, retirando o chapéu, e entrou na câmara escura, cantando:
Sai daí, velha Criatura! Desaparece à luz do dia!
Esvai-te como a neblina, como o vento choraminga, Pelas terras mais estéreis, além dos
longes montes! Não voltes nunca mais! Deixa o túmulo vazio! perdido e esquecido
sejas, mais negro que o negror
Onde portõesjamais se abrem, até que o mundo se conserte.
Com essas palavras, ouviu-se um grito e uma parte da extremidade interna da câmara caiu
com um estrondo. Então ouviu-se um guincho agudo blasfemando, desaparecendo
numa distância inimaginável; depois disso, silêncio.
- Venha, amigo Frodo - disse Tom. - Vamos sair para o
terreno limpo Preciso de sua
ajuda para levá-los.
Juntos, carregaram Merry, Pippin e Sam para fora. Quando saiu do túmulo pela última vez,
Frodo teve a impressão de ter visto uma mão decepada ainda se contorcendo,
como uma aranha ferida, num amontoado de terra caída. Tom ainda entrou mais uma vez, e
ouviu-se o ruído de muita pancada e pisoteio. Quando saiu, carregava nos braços
uma boa parte do tesouro: coisas de ouro e prata, cobre e bronze: muitas pedras e
correntes e jóias ornamentais. Subiu a colina verde e depositou-os no topo, ao
sol.
Ficou ali, com o chapéu na mão e o vento nos cabelos, olhando os três hobbits, que tinham
sido colocados de costas sobre o capim no lado oeste do montículo. Levantando
o braço direito, disse numa voz clara e imponente:

Acordem, meus camaradas! Acordem à minha voz!
Coração e corpo quentes! A pedra fria a sós!
A porta escura, aberta; o braço morto, quebrado. A Noitejá noutra Noite; o portão
escancarado.
Para a alegria de Frodo, os hobbits começaram a se mexer, espreguiçando-se e esfregando
os olhos, e então de repente se levantaram. Olharam em volta assustados,
primeiro para Frodo e depois para Tom, grande como a vida, no topo da colina acima deles;
e então olharam para si próprios, naqueles farrapos brancos e finos, coroados
e adornados com ouro pálido, tilintando com o som das jóias.
- Que raio? - começou Merry, sentindo o diadema de ouro caindo-lhe sobre um olho. Então
parou, e
uma sombra cobriu-lhe o rosto, e ele fechou os olhos. - É claro,
eu me lembro! - disse ele. - Os homens de Carn Dúm nos alcançaram durante a noite, e
fomos vencidos. Ah! a lança no meu coração!
#150
- Agarrou o próprio peito. - Não! Não! - disse ele, abrindo os olhos. O que estou dizendo? Estive sonhando. Onde você estava, Frodo?
- Pensei que estava perdido - disse Frodo. - Mas não quero falar sobre isso. Vamos pensar
no que vamos fazer agora! Vamos embora!
- Vestidos assim, senhor? - disse Sam. - Onde estão minhas roupas?
- Jogou seu diadema, o cinto e os anéis no chão, olhando em volta desesperado, como se
esperasse achar sua capa, jaqueta e calças, e outras vestimentas de hobbits
caídas em algum lugar ali perto.
- Você não vai mais achar suas roupas - disse Tom, pulando do túmulo e rindo enquanto
dançava em volta deles à luz do sol. Podia-se pensar que nada terrível ou perigoso
tinha acontecido, e na verdade o terror desapareceu de seus corações quando olharam para
ele, vendo o brilho alegre daqueles olhos.
- O que está querendo dizer? - perguntou Pippin, olhando para ele, meio intrigado e meio
entretido. - Por que não?
Mas Tom balançou a cabeça, e disse: - Vocês conseguiram sair de uma grande enrascada.
Roupas são uma perda mínima, se você escapa de se afogar. Fiquem felizes, e
deixem que a luz quente do
sol aqueça agora coração e corpo! Tirem esses farrapos
velhos. Corram nus sobre o capim, enquanto Toin vai caçar!
Desceu a colina aos pulos, assobiando e cantando. Olhando para baixo em direção a ele,
Frodo viu-o correndo para longe e em direção ao sul, ao longo da depressão
verde entre aquela colina e a próxima, ainda assobiando e chamando:
Ei, amigos! Vamos logo! Onde se meteram?
Em cima, embaixo, perto ou longe, os pôneis se perderam? FuçaFuça, Espanador, e Trombadinha! Meia-branca, Bolo-fofo e Orelhinha!
Assim ele cantava, correndo muito, jogando o chapéu para cima e apanhando-o em seguida,
até sumir numa dobra do solo: mas por algum tem po, o seu Ei, amigos! Vamos
logo! continuou chegando até eles, flutuando no vento, que tinha mudado de curso e
soprava do sul.
O ar estava ficando quente de novo. Os hobbits corriam sobre a grama, como Tom tinha
dito. Depois, ficaram deitados, tomando banho de sol, com o deleite daqueles
que foram levados de repente de um inverno rigoroso para um clima ameno, ou pessoas que,
depois de ficarem muito tempo adoentadas ou de cama, um belo dia acordam
e descobrem que estão inesperadamente boas, e que a nova manhã vem cheia de promessas.
#151
Na hora que Tom voltou, já estavam se sentindo fortes (e famintos). Ele reapareceu,
primeiro o chapéu, sobre a saliência da colina, e atrás dele vinham numa fila
obediente seis pôneis: cinco que eram dos hobbits e mais um. Este último era justamente o
Bolo-fofo: maior, mais forte, mais gordo (e mais velho) que os outros

cinco. Merry, que era dono dos outros, nunca os chamara assim, mas eles passaram a
atender pelos novos nomes que Tom lhes dera, até o fim de suas vidas. Tom os chamou
um por um, e eles subiram a colina, ficando em fila. Depois ele fez uma reverência para
os hobbits.
-Aqui estão seus pôneis, agora! - disse ele. - Eles têm mais senso (de certo modo) que
vocês, hobbits errantes - mais senso nas suas narinas. Pois à distância já
farejam o perigo ao qual vocês se atiram; e se correm para se salvar, então correm para o
lado certo. Devem perdoá-los, pois, embora tenham corações fiéis, não foram
feitos para enfrentar o terror das Criaturas Tumulares. Vejam, aqui estão eles de volta,
trazendo todos os fardos!
Merry, Sam e Pippín se vestiram com roupas de reserva que tinham trazido nas mochilas;
logo começaram a sentir muito calor, pois foram obrigados a colocar algumas
das coisas mais grossas e quentes que haviam tra zido para se proteger do inverno que
chegava.
- De onde vem esse animal velho, esse Bolo-fofo? - perguntou Frodo.
- Ele é meu - disse Tom. - Meu amigo de quatro pernas, embora raramente o monte; fica por
aí, livre nas encostas das colinas. Quando seus pôneis ficaram comigo,
conheceram o meu Bolo,
e durante esta noite procuraram-no farejando, correndo
logo para
encontrá-lo. Achei que Bolo os procuraria e, com suas palavras de
sabedoria, espantaria todo o medo que os dominava. Mas agora, meu alegre Bolo-fofo, o
velho Tom vai montar. pi! Tom vai com vocês, vai levá-los até a estrada, e
para isso precisa de um pônei. Pois não é fácil conversar com hobbits montados, se você
for a pé, tentando correr ao lado deles.
Os hobbits ouviram aquilo deliciados, e agradeceram a Tom muitas vezes; mas ele riu,
dizendo que eram tão bons em se perder, que não ficaria satisfeito até que os
visse sãos e salvos além dos limites de suas terras.
- Tenho coisas a fazer - disse ele - meus afazeres e minhas cantorias, minhas
conversas e caminhadas, e preciso cuidar de minhas terras. Tom não pode estar sempre por
perto, para abrir portas e fendas de salgueiros. Tom tem sua casa para cuidar,
e Fruta d'Ouro está esperando.
Pelo sol, podia-se ver que era de manhã, entre nove e dez horas, e os hobbits começaram a
pensar em comida. A última refeição tinha sido o almoço ao lado da pedra
fincada, no dia anterior. Agora comiam os restos das provisões oferecidas por Tom, com
acréscimos que ele mesmo trouxera consigo. Não foi uma grande refeição (levando
em consideração os hobbits
#152
e as circunstâncias) mas assim mesmo (graças a ela) se sentiram muito melhor. Enquanto
comiam, Tom subiu até o túmulo e examinou os tesouros. A maioria das
peças foram arrumadas numa pilha que brilhava no capim. Ordenou-lhes que ficassem ali, "à
disposição de qualquer um que as achasse, aves, animais, elfos ou homens,
e todas as criaturas gentis", pois assim o encanto do túmulo seria quebrado e espalhado,
e nenhuma criatura voltaria àquele lugar. Escolheu para si um pequeno broche,
adornado com pedras azuis que tinham muitas nuances, como flores de seda ou como as asas
de borboletas azuis. Olhou longamente para a jóia, como se tocado por alguma
lembrança, balançando a cabeça, e finalmente dizendo:
- Aqui está um brinquedo bonito para Tom e sua bela senhora. Bela era aquela que usou
isto há muito tempo sobre o ombro. Agora Fruta d'Ouro vai usá-lo e não a esqueceremos!
Para cada um dos hobbits escolheu um punhal, longo, em forma de folha e afiado, de um
artesanato maravilhoso, trabalhado com formas de serpentes vermelhas e douradas.
Os punhais brilharam quando foram retirados das bainhas pretas; eram forjados em algum
tipo estranho de metal, leve e resistente, e adornado com muitas pedras que
faiscavam. Seja por alguma virtude das bainhas, seja pelo encantamento do túmulo, as
lâminas, sem
ferrugem, afiadas, reluzentes ao sol, pareciam não ter sido alteradas pelo tempo.
- Facas velhas são longas o bastante para serem usadas como espadas

pelos hobbits - disse ele. - É bom ter lâminas afiadas, se pessoas do Condado forem
caminhando para o leste, para o sul, ou em direção ao perigo sombrio e distante.
- Então Tom disse que aquelas lâminas tinham sido forjadas muitos anos atrás pelos homens
de Ponente: eram inimigos do Senhor do Escuro, mas foram derrotados pelo
maldoso rei de Carn Dúm na Terra de Angmar.
- Poucos agora se recordam deles - murmurou Tom. - Mesmo assim, alguns ainda vagueiam,
filhos de reis esquecidos, caminhando solitários, protegendo os incautos das
coisas malignas.
Os hobbits não entenderam aquelas palavras, mas, enquanto Tom falava, tiveram uma visão
que parecia muito antiga, uma planície ampla e sombria, sobre a qual caminhavam
figuras de homens, altos e severos, com espadas brilhantes, e por último vinha um com uma
estrela na testa. Então a visão desapareceu, e voltaram para o mundo ensolarado.
Era hora de partir novamente. Aprontaram-se, arrumando as mochilas e carregando os
pôneis. As novas armas foram penduradas nos cintos de couro
, embaixo
dos casacos; os hobbits se sentiam muito desajeitados com elas, e imagina vam se algum
dia seriam úteis. Lutar nunca tinha antes passado por suas cabeças, nem mesmo
como uma das aventuras a que aquela fuga poderia conduzi-los.
#153
Finalmente partiram, conduzindo os pôneis colina abaixo; depois, num trote rápido,
seguiram ao longo do vale. Quando olharam para trás, viram o topo do velho túmulo
na colina, onde a luz do sol, reluzindo sobre o ouro, subia como uma chama amarela.
Depois contornaram uma saliência das colinas, e não o viram mais.
Embora Frodo olhasse em volta e para todos os lados,
não viu nem sinal das duas
pedras grandes, fincadas como um portão;
logo chegaram à fenda norte,
passando por ela rapidamente, e a região estendeu-se diante de seus olhos. Foi uma viagem
alegre, com Tom Bombadil trotando contente ao lado deles, ou à frente,
montado em Bolo-fofo, que ia bem mais rápido do que prometia a sua barrigueira. Tom
cantava a maior parte do tempo,
mas quase tudo o que saía de seus lábios não
fazia sentido, ou talvez fosse alguma língua estranha, desconhecida dos hobbits, uma
língua antiga cujas palavras eram principalmente de felicidade e prazer.
Avançavam mantendo o ritmo, mas logo perceberam que a Estrada ficava muito mais à frente
do que tinham imaginado. Mesmo sem neblina, o sono do meio-dia teria evitado
que chegassem até ela antes de anoitecer no dia anterior. A linha escura que tinham visto
não era uma fileira de árvores, mas arbustos crescendo à beira de um fosso
profundo, com barrancos íngremes dos dois lados. Tom disse que, em certa época, aquele
fosso tinha sido a divisa de um reino, muitos anos atrás. Parecia se lembrar
de alguma coisa triste relacionada a essa história, e não falava muito.
Desceram um barranco e subiram do lado oposto, passando através de uma fissura que havia
ali, e então Tom virou-se para o norte, pois até aquele ponto tinham rumado
um pouco em direção ao oeste. O terreno agora era aberto e bastante plano, de modo que
apertaram o passo; mas o sol já estava bem baixo quando finalmente viram à
frente uma fileira de árvores altas, e agora sabiam que tinham voltado para a Estrada,
depois de muitas aventuras inesperadas. Fizeram a galope este último trecho,
parando sob as sombras compridas das árvores. Estavam no alto de um outro barranco
íngreme, e a Estrada, agora apagada pelo cair da noite, se estendia em curvas
abaixo deles. Naquele ponto, ia quase do sudoeste para o nordeste, e à direita descia
abruptamente numa depressão larga.
O solo estava acidentado, com muitos vestígios
da forte chuva recém-caída; havia poças e buracos cheios de água.
Desceram o barranco, olhando para baixo e para cima. Não se via nada. Bem, finalmente
estamos aqui de novo! - disse Frodo. - Suponho que não perdemos mais que dois
dias no meu atalho através da Floresta
! Mas talvez o atraso tenha sido útil - pode tê-los feito perder nossa trilha.
Os outros olharam-no. Subitamente a sombra do medo dos Cavaleiros Negros tomou
conta deles de novo. Desde que entraram na Floresta, a principal

#154
coisa que tinham em mente era voltar para a Estrada; só agora, quando estavam diante
dela, é que se lembraram do perigo que os perseguia, e que muito provavelmente
os estaria esperando na própria Estrada. Olharam com ansiedade para trás, na direção do
sol poente, mas a Estrada se apresentava escura e vazia.
- O senhor acha - perguntou Pippin com hesitação -, o senhor acha que seremos perseguidos
esta noite?
- Não, espero que não esta noite - respondeu Tom Bombadil. - Talvez nem amanhã. Mas não
confiem em minhas suposições; pois não posso dizer nada com certeza. Para
o leste, meu conhecimento falha. Tom não é o senhor dos Cavaleiros da Terra Negra, que
fica distante de sua região.
Mesmo assim, os hobbits gostariam que os acompanhasse. Sentiam que ele saberia lidar com
os Cavaleiros Negros, se é que alguém podia lidar com eles. Logo estariam
avançando em terras completamente estranhas, além de todas as lendas do Condado, com
exceção apenas das mais distantes e remotas; no crepúsculo que se formava, sentiram
saudade de casa. Sentiam-se profundamente solitários e perdidos. Ficaram em silêncio,
relutando em se despedir pela última vez. Demorou para que percebessem que
Tom estava lhes desejando boa viagem, e dizendo que mantivessem a coragem e continuassem
cavalgando sem parar até anoitecer.
- Tom dará um conselho, enquanto durar este dia (depois do que serão guiados e
acompanhados pela própria sorte): a quatro milhas daqui, indo pela Estrada, encontrarão
uma aldeia, Bri, sob a Colina Bri, com portas viradas para o oeste. Ali vão ver uma velha
estalagem chamada
O Pônei Saltitante. Cevado Carrapicho é o dono, um homem
respeitável. Ali podem passar a noite, e depois a manhã favorecerá vocês no seu caminho.
Sejam corajosos, mas tenham cuidado! Mantenham a alegria nos corações, e
partam ao encontro de seu destino!
Imploraram para que fosse pelo menos até a estalagem, e que ali bebessem juntos mais uma
vez; mas Tom riu e recusou o convite, dizendo:
Aqui termina a terra de Tom: os confins ele não passa
Tem sua casa pra cuidar, e a sua espera Fruta d'Ouro.
Depois se virou, jogou o chapéu para cima, pulou no lombo de Bolo, e foi subindo o
barranco, cantando no crepúsculo.
Os hobbits subiram também, e ficaram olhando até que ele desapareceu de vista.
- Fico triste por ter de me despedir do Senhor Bombadil - disse Sam. É uma pessoa
extraordinária, disso não há dúvida. Acho que podemos avançar bastante e não ver
ninguém melhor, nem mais estranho. Mas não nego
#155
que ficarei feliz ao ver esse Pônei Saltitante que mencionou. Espero que seja igual ao
Dragão Verde, perto de nossa casa! Que tipo de gente existe
em Bri?
- Há hobbits em Bri - disse Merry -, além de
essoas grandes. Arrisco dizer que será bem parecido com nossa terra. O Pônei é uma boa
estalagem, Pelo que dizem. Meu pessoal vai lá de vez em quando.
- Pode ser tudo o que desejamos - disse Frodo. - Mas de qualquer forma é longe do
Condado. Não se sintam muito em casa! Por favor,
lembrem-se - todos vocês - de que
o nome Bolseiro NÃO deve ser mencionado. Sou o Sr. Monteiro, se for preciso dar algum
nome.
Montaram os pôneis e cavalgaram em silêncio dentro da noite. A escuridão foi descendo
rápido, enquanto iam avançando lentamente, descendo a colina e subindo de novo,
até que finalmente viram luzes piscando a certa distância.
Diante deles erguia-se a Colina Bri, barrando o caminho, uma massa escura contra estrelas
sombrias; em seu flanco oeste se aninhava uma grande aldeia. Agora se apressavam

em direção a ela, desejando apenas encontrar uma lareira, e uma porta que os separasse da
noite.
#156

#157
No PÔnei Saltitante

#158
nenhum outro lugar do mundo seria possível encontrar um arranjo peculiar (mas excelente)
como esse.
As pessoas de Bri, grandes e pequenas, não viajavam muito e os acontecimentos nas quatro
aldeias ocupavam a maior parte de seu tempo. Uma vez ou outra, os hobbíts
de Bri iam até a Terra dos Buques, ou à Quarta Leste; mas embora sua pequena terra não
distanciasse muito mais que um dia de viagem a cavalo, partindo da Ponte do Brandevin
e rumando para o leste, os hobbits do Condado raramente visitavam o lugar, nos últimos
tempos. Eventualmente, um morador da Terra dos Buques ou um Túk aventureiro
vinha até o Pônei Saltitante, para passar uma ou duas noites, mas até isso estava ficando
cada vez menos comum. Os hobbits do Condado se referiam aos de Bri, e a
quaisquer outros que moravam além das fronteiras, como os de Fora, e pouco se
interessavam por eles, por considerá-los enfadonhos e rudes. Provavelmente, era muito
maior o número dos de Fora espalhados pelo oeste do Mundo naqueles tempos do que o povo
do Condado pudesse imaginar. Alguns, sem dúvida, não passavam de vagabundos,
prontos para cavar um buraco em qualquer barranco e ficar apenas o tempo que lhes
aprouvesse. Mas, de qualquer modo, em Bri os hobbits eram decentes e prósPeros,
não sendo mais rústicos que a maioria de seus parentes distantes de Dentro. Ainda não
havia sido esquecida a época dos grandes intercâmbios entre Bri e o Condado.
Sabia-se que havia sangue de Bri correndo nas veias dos Brandebuques.
A aldeia de Bri tinha algtimas centenas de casas de pedra que pertenciam às pessoas
grandes, a maioria acima da Estrada, aninhando-se nas encostas das colinas, com
janelas voltadas para o oeste. Naquele lado, descrevendo mais que um semicírculo,
partindo da colina e voltando a ela, havia um fosso profundo, com uma cerca-viva
espessa no lado interno. A Estrada cruzava esse fosso através de um passadiço, mas no
ponto onde atingia a cerca-viva era barrada por um grande portal. Havia outro
portal no canto sul, onde a Estrada saía da aldeia. Os portões eram fechados ao cair da
noite; mas logo na entrada havia pequenos alojamentos para os porteiros.
Descendo a estrada, no ponto onde ela virava para a direita, contornando o pé da colina,
havia uma grande estalagem. Fora construída havia muito tempo, quando o
comércio nas estradas era bem mais intenso. Bri ficava num velho entroncamento de
caminhos; uma outra estrada antiga cruzava a Estrada Leste, logo que saía do fosso
na extremidade oeste da aldeia, e nos primeiros tempos homens e outras pessoas de vários
tipos tinham viajado muito por ela. Ainda existia, na Quarta Leste, o dito
popular: Estranho como as notícias que vêm de Bri, que descendia daqueles dias quando as
novidades do norte, sul, e leste podiam ser ouvidas na estalagem,
#159
e quando os hobbits do Condado costumavam comparecer com mais freqÜência para
ouvi-las. Mas as Terras do Norte tinham sido havia muito abandonadas e a Estrada Norte
raramente era usada: estava coberta de mato e o povo de Bri a chamava de Caminho Verde.
Entretanto, a estalagem de Bri ainda estava lá, e o dono era uma pessoa importante. Sua
casa era um ponto de encontro para os desocupados, conversadores e curiosos,
grandes e pequenos, habitantes das quatro aldeias. Também era um refúgio para Guardiões e
outras pessoas errantes, e para os viajantes (principalmente anões) que

ainda viajavam pela Estrada Leste, indo e vindo das Montanhas.
Estava escuro, e estrelas brancas brilhavam, quando Frodo e seus companheiros finalmente
alcançaram o entroncamento
com o Caminho Verde, perto da aldeia. Chegaram ao portão oeste e encontraram-no fechado,
mas na porta de alojamento, logo adiante, estava sentado um homem, que pulou
de pé e pegou uma lanterna, olhando-os através do portão, surpreso.
- O que querem, e de onde vêm? - perguntou ele de forma grosseira. Queremos ir até a
estalagem - respondeu Frodo. - Estamos indo para o leste, e não podemos continuar
a viagem esta noite.
- Hobbits! Quatro hobbits! E ainda por cima, do Condado, pelo jeito como falam - disse o
porteiro, baixinho como se falasse consigo mesmo. Lançou-lhes um olhar sombrio
e depois abriu o portão devagar, deixandoos entrar.
- Não é sempre que vemos pessoas do Condado viajando com pôneis pela Estrada à noite continuou ele, quando os hobbits pararam um momento diante de sua porta. Perdoem a minha curiosidade em saber que tipo de negócio os leva para o leste, além de
Bri! Quais são seus nomes, se me permitem a pergunta?
- Nossos nomes e negocios só dizem respeito a nós mesmos, e este não parece um bom lugar
para discuti-los - disse Frodo, não gostando da aparência do homem e do
tom de sua voz.
- Seus negócios só lhes dizem respeito, sem dúvida - disse o homem. Mas o meu trabalho é
fazer perguntas depois do anoitecer, e isso me diz respeito.
- Somos hobbits da Terra dos Buques, e queríamos viajar e nos hospedar na estalagem aqui
- acrescentou Merry. - Sou o Sr. Brandebuque. Isso é suficiente?
O povo
de Bri costumava receber melhor os viajantes, ou pelo menos foi isso que ouvi falar.
- Está bem! Está bem! - disse o homem. - Não foi minha intenção ofendê-los. Mas talvez
mais pessoas, além do velho porteiro Harry, venham a lhes fazer perguntas.
Há pessoas estranhas por aqui. Se forem ao Pônei, verão que não são os únicos hóspedes.
#160
Desejou-lhes boa noite, e os hobbits não disseram mais nada, mas Frodo podia ver pela luz
da lanterna que o homem ainda estava olhando para eles, cheio de curiosidade.
Perguntava-se o que teria deixado o porteiro tão desconfiado, e se alguém estivera
indagando sobre um grupo de hobbits. Poderia ter sido Gandalf. Era provável que
ele tivesse chegado, durante o tempo em que ficaram na Floresta e nas Colinas. Mas algo
na aparência e na voz do porteiro o deixava inquieto.
O homem ficou observando os hobbits por um momento, e então entrou na casa. Logo que
virou as costas, uma figura escura rapidamente pulou por sobre o portão, desaparecendo
nas sombras da rua da aldeia.
Os hobbits subiram uma ladeira suave, passando por algumas casas isoladas, e pararam na
frente da estalagem. As casas tinham uma aparência grande e estranha para
eles. Sam contemplou a estalagem com seus três andares e muitas janelas, e sentiu seu
coração apertado. De vez em quando, durante a viagem, imaginara encontrar gigantes
mais altos que árvores, e outras criaturas ainda mais aterrorizantes, mas naquele momento
estava achando que a primeira vista dos homens e de suas casas altas já
era o suficiente, para não dizer demais, para o final escuro de um dia cansativo.
Começava a pensar em cavalos negros, todos já selados, nas sombras do pátio da
estalagem, e em Cavaleiros Negros espiando das escuras janelas de cima.
- É claro que não vamos passar a noite aqui, não é, senhor? - exclamou ele. - Se existem
hobbits por essas bandas, por que não procuramos algum que esteja disposto
a nos hospedar? Poderíamos nos sentir mais à vontade.
- Qual é o problema com a estalagem? - perguntou Frodo. - Tom Bombadil a recomendou.
Espero que seja bastante aconchegante lá dentro. Mesmo vista de fora, a estalagem
parecia uma casa agradável aos olhos
de quem a conhecia. A parte da frente dava para a Estrada, e dois pavilhões estendíam-se
para os fundos, construidos em terrenos parcialmente cortados das encostas

mais baixas da colina, de modo que, na parte posterior, as janelas do segundo andar
ficavam ao nível do solo. Havia um grande arco pelo qual se chegava ao pátio
entre os dois pavilhões e à esquerda sob o arco havia um grande saguão de entrada,
precedido de alguns degraus largos. A porta estava aberta, deixando escapar a
luz do interior. Sobre o arco havia uma lamparina e embaixo dela estava pendurada uma
grande tabuleta que trazia o desenho de um pônei branco e roliço, empinado
sobre as patas traseiras. Sobre a porta estava pintado, em letras brancas:
O Pônei Saltitante de Cevado Carrapicho. Muitas das janelas mais baixas mostravam luz
por trás de grossas cortinas.
Enquanto hesitavam lá fora no escuro, alguém começou a cantar algo alegre do lado de
dentro, e várias vozes animadas acompanharam, cantando alto o refrão. Ficaram
escutando esses sons animados por alguns momentos
#161
e então desceram dos pôneis. A canção acabou numa explosão de aplausos e risadas.
os hobbits conduziram os pôneis sob o arco, e após deixá-los no pátio subiram os degraus.
Frodo foi na frente e quase trombou com um homem gordo e baixo, careca
e de rosto vermelho. Usava um avental branco, e saía alvoroçado por uma porta para entrar
por outra, carregando uma bandeja repleta de canecas cheias.
- Será que... - começou Frodo.
- um instantinho, por favor! - gritou o homem por sobre os ombros, desaparecendo naquela
babei de vozes, em meio a uma nuvem de fumaça. Mais um momento e já aparecia
de novo, limpando as mãos no avental.
- Boa noite, pequeno senhor! - disse ele, com uma reverência que fez com que sua cabeça
quase tocasse o chão. - Em que posso ajudá-lo?
.
- Queremos cama para quatro pessoas, e lugares no estábulo para cinco pôneis, se
isso puder ser arranjado. É o Sr. Carrapicho?
- Está certo! Cevado é meu nome. Cevado Carrapicho às suas ordens! São do Condado, hein?
- disse ele, e então de repente bateu
a mão na testa, como se tentasse lembrar alguma coisa. - Hobbits - gritou ele. - De que
isso me faz
lembrar? Posso perguntar seus nomes, senhor?
- Sr. Túk e Sr. Brandebuque - disse Frodo. - E este é Sam Gamgi. Meu nome é Monteiro.
- Veja só - disse o Sr. Carrapicho, estalando os dedos. - Fugiu-me da cabeça de novo! Mas
vai voltar, quando eu tiver tempo para pensar. Nem consigo acompanhar minhas
pernas, mas vou ver o que posso fazer para ajudá-los. Atualmente é bem raro termos aqui
um grupo vindo do Condado, e eu ficaria triste se não pudesse recebê-los.
Mas a quantidade de pessoas aqui hoje ultrapassou o habitual. Desgraça pouca é bobagem,
como se costuma dizer em Bri.
Ei, Nob - gritou ele. - Onde está, seu trapalhão de pés peludos? Nob?
- Estou indo, senhor! Estou indo! - Um hobbit de aparência alegre surgiu por uma
porta, e, vendo
os viajantes, parou de repente, olhando-os com grande interesse.
- Onde está Bob? - perguntou o proprietário. - Você não sabe? Bem, encontre-o! Rapidinho!
Não tenho seis pernas, nem seis olhos! Diga a Bob que há cinco pôneis para
acomodar no estábulo. Ele tem de achar espaço de algum jeito. - Nob saiu pisando duro,
com um sorriso e piscando um olho.
- Bem, agora, o que eu ia dizendo? - disse o Sr. Carrapicho, batendo na testa. - Uma
coisa faz esquecer a outra, por assim dizer. Estou tão ocupado hoje que minha
cabeça está girando. Há um grupo que veio do Sul e chegou pelo Caminho Verde a noite
passada - e isso já foi esquisito o suficiente, para começar. Depois apareceu
hoje uma comitiva de anões indo
#162
para o Oeste. E agora vocês. Se não fossem hobbits, duvido que poderíamos acomodálos. Mas temos um ou dois quartos no pavilhão norte que foram feitos especialmente

para hobbits, quando este lugar foi construido. No andar térreo, como geralmente
preferem, com janelas redondas e tudo o que gostam. Espero que fiquem bem acomodados.
Estão querendo cear, sem dúvida. Logo que for possível. Agora, por aqui!
Conduzíu-os por alguns metros de um corredor e abriu uma porta. Aqui está uma boa
salinha! - disse ele. - Espero que gostem. Agora desculpem-me por estar tão ocupado.
Não há tempo para conversas. Devo ir andando. É um trabalho duro para duas pernas, mas
nem assim eu emagreço. Passarei por aqui mais tarde. Se quiserem qualquer
coisa, toquem a campainha, e Nob virá até aqui. Se não vier, toquem de novo e gritem!
Saiu finalmente, e deixou-os com a sensação de estarem sem fôlego. Parecia capaz de falar
sem parar, e não importava o quão ocupado estivesse. Viram-se numa sala
pequena e confortável. Havia um belo fogo queimando na lareira, em frente do qual ficavam
algumas poltronas baixas e confortáveis. Havia uma mesa redonda, já coberta
com uma toalha branca, e sobre ela uma grande campainha, Mas Nob, o empregado hobbit,
veio esbaforido antes que eles pensassem em tocá-la. Trouxe velas e uma bandeja
cheia de pratos.
- Querem alguma coisa para beber, senhores? - perguntou ele. - Gostariam que lhes
mostrasse os quartos, enquando a ceia está sendo preparada? Já tinham tomado banho
e estavam em meio a muitas canecas de cerveja quando o Sr. Carrapicho e Nob vieram
de novo. Num piscar de olhos, a mesa estava posta. Havia sopa quente, carnes frias, uma
torta de amoras, pães frescos,
nacos de manteiga, e meio queijo curado: comida boa e simples, boa como a do Condado, e
suficientemente semelhante à de casa para afastar os últimos receios de Sam
(já bastante diminuídos pela excelência da cerveja).
O proprietário ficou por ali uns momentos e depois se propôs a ir embora.
- Não sei se gostariam de se juntar ao grupo, depois de cearem - disse ele parando na
porta.
- Talvez prefiram ir para suas camas. Mas mesmo assim o grupo ficaria muito satisfeito em
recebê-los, se quisessem isso. Não recebemos visitantes de Fora - quer
dizer, viajantes do Condado, é melhor que eu diga, me desculpem - com freqüência, e
gostaríamos de ouvir alguma novidade, ou alguma história ou canção de que se
lembrem. Mas, como quiserem! Toquem a campainha se faltar alguma coisa.
Sentiam-se tão reconfortados e encorajados ao final da ceia (que durou cerca de três
quartos de hora ininterruptos, e sem conversa jogada fora) que Frodo, Pippin
e Sam decidiram juntar-se ao grupo. Merry disse que lá estaria muito abafado. - Vou ficar
aqui quieto, perto do fogo por um tempo, e tal-vez
#163
depois eu saia para respirar ar puro. Cuidado com o que vão dizer, e não esqueçam que
nosso plano é fugir em segredo, e ainda estamos na estrada alta não muito
longe do Condado.
- Está certo! - disse Pippin. - Cuíde-se! Não se perca e não se esqueça de que já fora é
menos seguro que aqui dentro!
o grupo estava na grande sala de estar da estalagem. Havia um grande número de pessoas, e
de todos os tipos, como descobriu Frodo depois que seus olhos se acostumaram
à luz. A iluminação vinha principalmente de um fogo alimentado por achas de lenha, pois
as três lamparinas penduradas às vigas emitiam uma luz fraca, meio velada
pela fumaça. Cevado Carrapícho estava em pé perto do fogo, conversando com alguns anões e
com um ou dois homens de aparência estranha. Nos bancos sentavam-se vários
tipos de pessoas: homens de Bri, um grupo de hobbits nativos (sentados, conversando),
mais alguns anões e outras figuras vagas, dificeis de distinguir nas sombras
e cantos.
Assim que os hobbits do Condado chegaram, ouviu-se um coro de boasvindas, que vinha dos
habitantes de Bri. Os estranhos, especialmente aqueles que tinham vindo pelo
Caminho Verde, olharam-nos curiosos. O proprietário apresentou os recém-chegados às
pessoas de Bri tão rapidamente que, embora tenham escutado muitos nomes, mal
podiam ter certeza sobre quem tinha que nome. Os homens de Bri pareciam ter nomes
bastante botânicos (e para o povo do Condado, bastante esquisitos) como Junco,

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Barba-deBode, Urzal, Macieira, Cardo e Samambaia (para não falar em Carrapicho
). Alguns dos hobbits tinham nomes similares. Os Artemisas, por exemplo,
pareciam ser numerosos. Mas a maioria deles tinha nomes naturais, como Ladeira, Texugo,
Buraqueiro, Areias e
Tuneloso, muitos dos quais eram usados no Condado, Havia
vários Monteiros de Estrado, e como estes não podiam conceber a idéia de ter o mesmo nome
de alguém de quem não fossem parentes, acolheram Frodo como um primo que
estivera longe muito tempo.
Os hobbits de Bri eram, na verdade, simpáticos e curiosos, e Frodo logo descobriu que
teria de dar alguma explicação sobre o motivo que o trazia ali. Justificou
que estava interessado em história e geografia (ao que várias cabeças balançaram em sinal
de aprovação, embora nenhuma dessas duas palavras fosse muito usada no
dialeto de Brí). Frodo disse que estava pensando em escrever um livro (
ao que se fez
um silêncio atônito), e que ele e seus amigos queriam coletar informações
sobre os hobbíts que moravam fora do Condado, especialmente nas terras do Leste.
Depois que falou isso, um coro de vozes irrompeu. Se Frodo realmente quisesse escrever um
livro, e se tivesse muitas orelhas, teria coletado o suficiente para sete
capítulos em poucos minutos. E, como se isso não bastasse,
#164
foi feita uma lista, começando com "o velho Carrapicho aqui", de nomes de pessoas a quem
poderia recorrer se precisasse de informações mais detalhadas. Mas,
depois de um tempo, como Frodo não fizesse menção de escrever um livro ali mesmo, os
hobbits voltaram às suas perguntas sobre as coisas do Condado. Frodo não se
mostrou muito comunicativo, e logo se viu sentado num canto, sozinho, ouvindo e olhando
ao redor.
Os homens e anões falavam a maior parte do tempo sobre acontecimentos distantes, trazendo
novidades de um tipo que já estava ficando bem comum. Havia problemas
no Sul, e parecia que os homens que tinham vindo pelo Caminho Verde estavam de mudança,
procurando terras onde pudessem encontrar um pouco de paz.
O povo de Bri
se mostrava solidário, mas não parecia muito preparado para receber um grande número de
forasteiros em sua pequena região. Um dos viajantes, camarada vesgo e de
aparência desagradável, estava prevendo que mais e mais pessoas viriam para o Norte num
futuro próximo. - Se não providenciarem lugares para eles, eles mesmos farão
isso, pois têm direito de viver, como as outras pessoas - disse ele em voz alta. Os
habitantes locais não pareciam contentes diante da perspectiva.
Os hobbits não prestavam muita atenção a tudo isso, e parecia que aquele assunto não lhes
dizia respeito, pelo menos por enquanto, Em termos práticos, as pessoas
grandes não poderiam mendigar acomodações em tocas de hobbits. Por isso estavam mais
interessados em Sam e Pippin, que agora se sentiam perfeitamente à vontade,
e conversavam alegremente sobre os acontecimentos do Condado. Pippin estava provocando
uma onda de risos ao fazer um relatório sobre a queda do telhado da Toca Municipal
em Grã Cava: Will Pealvo, o prefeito e o hobbit mais gordo da Quarta Oeste, ficou coberto
de cal, e saiu de lá como um bolinho coberto de farinha. Mas muitas das
perguntas feitas deixaram Frodo um pouco inquieto. Um dos habitantes de Bri, que parecia
ter estado no Condado muitas vezes, queria saber onde os Monteiros moravam
e de quem eram parentes.
De repente Frodo percebeu que um homem de aparência estranha e marcada pelos anos,
sentado num canto escuro, também estava escutando a conversa dos hobbits com muita
atenção. Tinha uma caneca alta à sua frente, e fumava um cachimbo de haste longa, talhado
de forma curiosa. As pernas estavam esticadas, mostrando botas altas de
couro macio que lhe serviam bem, mas já bastante surradas e agora cobertas de lama. Uma
capa cheia de marcas de viagem, feita de um tecido verde-escuro, o cobria
quase por completo, e apesar do calor da sala, ele usava um capuz que lhe ocultava o
rosto em sombras; mas podia-se ver o brilho em seus olhos enquanto observava
os hobbits.

- Quem é aquele? - perguntou Frodo, quando teve uma chance de cochichar para o Sr.
Carrapicho. - Acho que não fomos apresentados.
#165
- Aquele? - disse o proprietário, cochichando uma resposta, erguendo a sobrancelha sem
voltar a cabeça. - Não sei ao certo. É um dos errantes, os guardiões, como
os chamamos. Raramente fala: no máximo conta uma história diferente, quando lhe dá na
cabeça. Desaparece por um mês, um ano, e então aparece de novo. Chegou e partiu
com bastante freqüêncía na última primavera: mas não tem vindo muito aqui nos últimos
tempos. Nunca ouvi o seu verdadeiro nome, mas é conhecido como Passolargo.
Suas pernas longas andam numa velocidade muito grande; mas ele não conta a ninguem o
motivo de tanta pressa. Mas não dá para explicar o leste e o oeste, como dizemos
aqui em Bri, referindo-nos às excentricidades dos guardiões e do pessoal do Condado, sem
querer ofender o senhor. É interessante que tenha perguntado sobre ele.
- Mas nesse momento o senhor Carrapícho foi chamado por alguém pedindo mais cerveja, e
aquela última observação ficou sem explicação.
Frodo percebeu que Passolargo olhava agora para ele, como se tivesse ouvido ou adivinhado
tudo o que se conversou. Naquele mesmo momento, com um aceno de mão e um
sinal de cabeça, convidou Frodo a sentar-se com ele. Quando Frodo se aproximou,
Passolargo jogou o capuz para trás, deixando à vista uma cabeça despenteada, coberta
de cabelos escuros com mechas grisalhas, e num rosto austero e pálido um par de olhos
cinzentos e penetrantes.
- Chamam-me Passolargo - disse ele numa voz baixa. - Estou muito satisfeito em conhecêlo, senhor Monteiro, se o velho Carrapicho me disse o nome certo.
- Disse sim - respondeu Frodo secamente. Estava longe de se sentir à vontade, sob o
efeito daqueles olhos penetrantes.
- Bem, senhor Monteiro - disse Passolargo. - Se fosse o senhor, não deixaria seus jovens
amigos falarem demais. Bebida, lareira e encontros casuais são bastante
agradáveis, mas, bem - aqui não é o Condado. Existem pessoas estranhas por aqui. Apesar
de que provavelmente o senhor esteja achando que não tenho o direito de dizer
isso - acrescentou ele com um sorriso oblíquo, vendo o olhar de Frodo. - E viajantes
ainda mais estranhos já passaram aqui por Bri ultimamente - continuou ele, atento
ao rosto de Frodo.
Frodo retribuiu o olhar mas não disse nada; Passolargo não fez mais nenhum sinal. Parecia
ter fixado a atenção em Pippin. Alarmado, Frodo percebeu que o ridículo
jovem Túk, encorajado pelo sucesso obtido com a história do prefeito de Grã Cava, fazia
agora um relato
cômico da festa de despedida de Bilbo. Já estava começando
a imitar o Discurso, quase atingindo o ponto do surpreendente Desaparecimento.
Frodo estava zangado. A história era bastante inofensiva para a maioria dos hobbits do
lugar: apenas uma história divertida sobre aquelas
pessoas
#166
engraçadas que moravam do outro lado do Rio; mas certas pessoas (o velho Carrapicho, por
exemplo) sabiam uma coisa ou outra, e provavelmente tinham ouvido rumores
sobre o desaparecimento de Bilbo, muito tempo atrás. Isso traria o nome Bolseiro às suas
mentes, especialmente se em Bri alguém tivesse perguntado sobre ele.
Frodo se impacientava, tentando decidir o que fazer. Pippin evidentemente estava
apreciando muito a atenção da platéia, e tinha se esquecido do perigo que corriam.
Frodo de repente receou que, naquela disposição, Pippin pudesse mencionar o Anel, o que
provavelmente seria desastroso.
- É melhor fazer algo logo! - cochichou Passolargo em sua orelha. Frodo pulou, ficando em
pé numa mesa, e começou a falar. A atenção da platéia de Pippin foi desviada.
Alguns dos hobbits olharam para Frodo e riram, batendo palmas, pensando que o Sr.
Monteiro tinha tomado toda a cerveja a que tinha direito.

Frodo de repente se sentiu muito tolo, e se viu (como era seu hábito quando fazia um
discurso) tateando as coisas que tinha no bolso. Sentiu o Anel na corrente,
e quase sem perceber foi tomado pelo desejo de colocá-lo e desaparecer daquela situação
imbecil. Tinha a impressão de que, de alguma maneira, a sugestão o alcançava
vinda de fora, de alguém ou alguma coisa na sala. Resistiu firmemente à tentação, e
fechou o Anel na mão, como se para mantê-lo sob controle e evitar que escapasse
ou o enganasse. De qualquer modo, o Anel não lhe trouxe inspiração. Pronunciou "algumas
palavras adequadas", como teriam dito no Condado: Estamos todos muito agradecidos
pela gentileza de sua recepção, e me aventuro a ter esperanças de que minha breve visita
ajude a renovar os velhos laços de amizade entre o Condado e Bri; depois
disso, hesitou e tossiu.
Todos na sala agora olhavam para ele. - Uma canção - gritou um dos hobbits. - Uma canção!
Uma canção! - gritaram todos os outros. - Vamos lá, agora, senhor, cante
alguma coisa que nunca ouvimos antes.
Por um instante, Frodo parou embasbacado. Então, desesperado, começou uma canção ridícula
muito apreciada por Bilbo (e da qual na verdade se orgulhava muito, pois
ele mesmo tinha feito a letra). Era sobre uma estalagem, e talvez por isso tenha vindo à
mente de Frodo exatamente naquele momento. Aqui está a canção completa.
Hoje em dia, geralmente apenas algumas palavras dela são lembradas.
Existe um lugar, alegre e antigo, ao pé da colina rara;
Lá tem cerveja tão escura
Que o Homem da Lua veio à procura uma noite e encheu a cara.
#167
O dono tem um gato alcoólatra que sabe tocar violino;
Sobe e desce o arco suave,
Em cima agudo, embaixo grave, no meio serrotefino.
O dono tem um vira-lata que adora ouvir piadas; Quando o povo está animado, Empina a
orelha concentrado
e ri.a bandeiras despregadas.
Tem também vaca chifruda orgulhosa como rainha;
Ela gosta de música à beça, Rebola o rabo e arremessa dançando solta sozinha.
Ai! os lindos pratos de prata
e os talheres em quantidade!
Há aos domingos um par convidado, E tudo é polido e cuidado
ao sábado pela tarde.
O Homem da Lua vai bebendo, o gato toca com bossa; Prato e gafó dançam na hora, Rebola a
vaca lá,fora,
e o vira-lata o rabo coça.
O Homem da Lua pede mais uma, sob a mesa depois cai;
Dorme e sonha com mais cerveja, Vai-se a noite benfazeja
e a aurora chegando vai.
Diz o dono ao gato alto.- Os cavalos brancos da Lua Rinchando mordem ofreio; Mas seu dono dormefieio
e o soljá se insinua.
Ver Apêndice D, nota 6, vol. III.
#168
O gato então de novo ataca
num som de acordarfinado: Vai serrando enquanto pode
o dono o Homem sacode:
- São mais de três - diz o coitado.
Homem levam para a colina
e o enrolam na própria Lua, Os cavalos atrás galopando, Qual veado a vaca saltando,
e um prato pula pra rua.

Mais depressa toca o violino; o vira-lata põe-se a ladrar,
Cavalo e vaca de bananeira; Querer dormir é brincadeira: todos voltam a dançar.
Pingue! Pongue! as cordas se partem! a vaca pula pra Lua,
O vira-lata põe-se a rir, Um prato ameaça fúgir
com colher que não é sua.
A Lua redonda foi embora,
e o sol que agora vai surgir Não acredita no que vê, Porque, apesar do
amanhecer,
agora todos vão dormir.
Houve um aplauso longo e alto. Frodo tinha uma boa voz, e a cançao tinha provocado a
imaginação deles. - Onde está o velho Cevado? - gritavam eles. - Ele tem de
ouvir esta. Bob tinha de ensinar o gato dele a tocar violino, e então teríamos um baile.
- Pediram mais cerveja e começaram a gritar: - Cante de novo, senhor! Vamos!
Mais uma vez!
Fizeram Frodo tomar mais uma caneca e começar a canção de novo, enquanto muitos o
acompanhavam, pois a melodia era bem conhecida, e eles eram rápidos para pegar
a letra. Agora era a vez de Frodo se sentir bem consigo mesmo. Fazia cabriolagens em cima
da mesa, e no momento em que ia cantar a vaca pula pra Lua, deu um salto
no ar. Vigoroso demais, pois ele caiu, bateu numa bandeja cheia de canecas, escorregou e
rolou da mesa
#169
para cair no chão com um estrondo de pancada, talheres tinindo e depois o golpe de algo
batendo no chão. A platéia toda abriu a boca preparando uma risada, mas ficou
boquiaberta num silêncio atônito: o cantor desaparecera. Simplesmente desvanecera, como
se tivesse escapado através do assoalho sem deixar buraco!
Os hobbits do lugar ficaram olhando assustados; depois puseram-se de pé e chamaram
Carrapicho. Todo o grupo se afastou de Sam e Pippin, que se viram deixados de
lado num canto, passando a ser observados com olhos sombrios e desconfiados, a certa
distância. Agora ficava claro que muitas pessoas os consideravam como acompanhantes
de um mágico itinerante, cujos poderes e propósitos não eram conhecidos. Mas havia um
habitante de Bri de pele escura, que ficou olhando para eles como quem sabia
das coisas, e com um ar zombeteiro que os deixava pouco à vontade. Depois escapou pela
porta, sendo seguido pelo sulista vesgo: os dois tinham estado cochichando
juntos por um bom tempo durante a noite. Harry, o porteiro, também saiu logo após eles.
Frodo se sentiu um perfeito idiota. Não sabendo mais o que fazer, foi se arrastando por
baixo das mesas até o canto escuro onde estava Passolargo que, sentado sem
mover um dedo, não demonstrava o que pensava. Frodo se encostou na parede e tirou o Anel.
Como tinha vindo parar em seu dedo, ele não sabia. Só podia supor que estivera
mexendo no bolso enquanto cantava, e que de alguma forma o Anel escorregara em seu dedo,
no momento em que tinha feito um movimento brusco para amortecer a queda.
Por um instante, chegou a se perguntar se o próprio Anel não lhe tinha pregado uma peça;
talvez tivesse tentado se revelar em resposta a algum desejo ou ordem que
foi sentida na sala. Frodo não tinha gostado da cara dos homens que tinham saído.
- Bem... - disse Passolargo, quando Frodo reapareceu. - Por que fez aquilo? Foi pior do
que qualquer coisa que seus amigos pudessem dizer. Você atolou o pé na...
Ou será que deveria dizer, atolou o dedo?
- Não sei o que quer dizer - disse Frodo, perturbado e alarmado.
- Ah, você sabe sim! - respondeu Passolargo. - Mas é melhor esperarmos até o tumulto
acabar. Depois, por favor, Sr. Bolseiro, eu gostaria de trocar umas palavras
com o senhor em particular.
- Sobre o quê? - perguntou Frodo, ignorando o uso repentino de seu nome.
- Um assunto de certa importância - para nós dois - respondeu Passolargo, olhando nos
olhos de Frodo. - Você pode ouvir alguma coisa de seu interesse.
- Muito bem - disse Frodo, tentando parecer despreocupado. - Conversaremos mais tarde.

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Enquanto isso, a discussão continuava ao lado da lareira. O Sr. Carrapicho tinha chegado
pisando firme, e agora tentava escutar vários relatos dispares sobre o evento,
tudo ao mesmo tempo.
- Eu o vi, Sr. Carrapicho - disse um hobbit -, ou pelo menos não o vi, se entende o que
quero dizer. Ele simplesmente desapareceu no ar, por assim dizer.
- Não me diga, Sr. Artemisa - exclamou o proprietário, parecendo intrigado.
- Digo sim! - respondeu Artemisa. - E ainda por cima sei do que estou falando.
- Existe alguma coisa errada - disse Carrapicho, balançando a cabeça. - Aquele Monteiro
era grande demais para se desfazer assim em puro ar, ou em ar impuro, como
é mais provável aqui nesta sala.
- Bem, onde ele está agora? - gritaram várias vozes.
- Como é que posso saber? Ele pode ir para onde quiser, contanto que pague a conta amanhã
cedo. Temos aí o Sr. Túk. Ele não desapareceu.
- Bem, eu vi o que vi, e vi o que não vi - disse Artemisa obstinadamente.
- E eu insisto que deve haver algo errado - repetiu Carrapicho, apanhando a bandeja e
recolhendo os cacos.
- É claro que há algo errado! - disse Frodo. - Eu não desapareci. Aqui estou! Estava só
trocando umas palavrinhas com o Sr. Passolargo aqui no canto.
Avançou até a luz da lareira, mas a maioria do grupo se afastou, ainda mais perturbada
que antes. Não estavam nem um pouco satisfeitos com a explicação de que Frodo
tinha se arrastado rapidamente sob as mesas depois de sua queda. A maioria dos hobbits e
homens de Bri saiu dali ofendida, sem ânimo para mais divertimento naquela
noite. Um ou dois deles olharam feio para Frodo e foram embora resmungando entre si. Os
anões e os dois ou três homens estranhos que ainda permaneciam se levantaram
e disseram boa noite ao proprietário, mas não a Frodo e seus amigos. Logo todo mundo
tinha saído, com a exceção de Passolargo, que continuava sentado, despercebido,
perto da parede.
O Sr. Carrapicho não parecia muito desconcertado. Achava, provavelmente, que seu
estabelecimento ficaria cheio de novo nas proximas noites, até que o mistério atual
tivesse sido completamente debatido. -Agora, o que andou fazendo, Sr. Monteiro? perguntou ele. -Amedrontando meus clientes e quebrando minhas canecas com suas
acrobacias?
- Sinto muito por ter causado problemas - disse Frodo. - Não tive a intenção, pode ter
certeza. Foi um terrível acidente.
- Está bem, Sr. Monteiro! Mas se o senhor for fazer mais alguma acrobacia, ou feitiçaria,
ou o que quer que seja, é melhor que avise as pessoas
#171
com antecedência - e me avise. O pessoal daqui é meio desconfiado de qualquer coisa que
não seja normal - esquisita, se o senhor me entende, e nós não nos acostumamos
de uma hora para outra.
- Não farei mais nada assim de novo, Sr. Carrapicho, eu lhe prometo. E agora acho que vou
dormir. Amanhã devemos acordar cedo. Será que pode providenciar para que
nossos pôneis estejam prontos por volta das oito horas?
- Muito bem, mas antes que parta, Sr. Monteiro, eu gostaria de trocar uma palavra com o
senhor em particular. Uma coisa acabou de voltar à minha memória, e eu preciso
lhe contar. Espero que não leve a mal. Preciso cuidar de umas coisas, e depois vou até o
seu quarto, se o senhor permitir.
- Certamente! - disse Frodo, mas seu coração ficou gelado. Perguntava-se quantas
conversas em particular teria antes de dormir, e o que elas revelariam. Estariam
todas aquelas pessoas unidas contra ele? Frodo começou até a desconfiar que o rosto gordo
de Carrapicho escondia desigruos obscuros.

CAPITULO X
PASSOLARGO

Frodo, Sam e Pippin voltaram para a pequena sala. Estava tudo escuro. Merry ainda não
tinha chegado e o fogo já quase se extinguira. Foi só quando reavivaram as
brasas e jogaram mais gravetos na lareira que descobriram que Passolargo os tinha
acompanhado. Ali estava ele, calmamente sentado numa poltrona perto da porta.
- Olá! - disse Pippin. - Quem é o senhor, e o que deseja?
- Chamam-me Passolargo - respondeu ele. - E embora possa ter esquecido, seu amigo
prometeu conversar comigo em particular.
- O senhor disse que poderia me dizer algo do meu interesse - disse Frodo. O que é?
- Várias coisas - respondeu Passolargo. - Mas, é claro, tenho meu preço.
- Que quer dizer? - perguntou Frodo secamente.
- Não se assuste! E só isto: Direi o que sei, e darei bons conselhos ao senhor - mas vou
querer uma recompensa.
E qual será ela?, eu pergunto - disse Frodo. Suspeitava agora que tinha caído nas mãos de
um chantagista, e lembrava com certo desconforto que tinha trazido apenas
uma pequena quantia em dinheiro. Tudo o que tinha mal satisfaria um patife daqueles, e ao
mesmo tempo não era dinheiro que pudesse jogar fora.
- Nada que não esteja ao seu alcance - respondeu Passolargo com um sorriso lento, como se
adivinhasse o pensamento de Frodo. - Apenas isto: deve me levar junto com
o senhor, até que eu queira abandoná-lo.
- Ah, é?! - retorquiu Frodo surpreso, mas não muito aliviado. - Mesmo que precisasse de
mais um companheiro, eu não concordaria com uma coisa dessas, não antes
de saber mais sobre o senhor e suas atividades.
- Excelente! - exclamou Passolargo, cruzando as pernas e se recostando na cadeira. Parece que o senhor está voltando ao normal de novo, e isso é ótimo. Até agora
foi descuidado demais. Muito bem! Direi o que sei, e deixarei a recompensa por sua conta.
Ficará feliz em
garanti-la, depois de me ouvir.
- Então prossiga! - disse Frodo. - O que o senhor sabe?
- Muito; muitas coisas obscuras - disse Passolargo com uma voz triste. - Mas em relação
ao seu negócio... - ele se levantou e dirigiu-se até a porta, abrindo-a e
olhando para fora rapidamente. Depois fechou-a sem
#174
fazer ruído e sentou-se de novo. - Tenho ouvidos atentos - continuou ele, abaixando a
voz. - E, embora eu não possa desaparecer, já cacei muitas coisas ferozes e
espertas, e geralmente posso evitar que me vejam, se desejar. Agora, eu estava atrás da
cerca-viva esta noite, na Estrada a oeste de Bri, quando quatro hobbits apareceram,
vindo da região das colinas. Não preciso repetir tudo o que disseram ao velho Tom
Bombadil, ou o que conversaram entre si, mas uma coisa me interessou. Porfavor.
lembrem-se, disse um deles, de que o nome Bolseiro não deve ser mencionado. Sou o Sr.
Monteiro. se for preciso dar algum nome. Isso me interessou tanto que eu os
segui até aqui. Pulei o portão logo atrás deles. Talvez o Sr. Bolseiro tenha um motivo
honesto que o faça deixar para trás o próprio nome; mas se for assim, devo
pedir que ele e seus amigos sejam mais cautelosos.
- Não vejo por que meu nome possa despertar interesse em Bri - disse Frodo furioso. - E
ainda preciso saber o motivo do seu interesse.
O Sr. Passolargo pode ter
um motivo honesto para ficar espionando; mas se for assim, devo pedir que se explique.

- Boa resposta - disse Passolargo rindo. - Mas a explicação é simples: eu estava
procurando um hobbit chamado Frodo Bolseiro. Queria encontrálo rápido. Sabia que
ele estava levando do Condado, bem, um segredo que interessa a mim e a meus amigos.
- Agora, não me leve a mal! - gritou ele, logo que Frodo levantou-se da poltrona e Sam
ficou em pé com esgares no rosto. - Cuidarei melhor do segredo do que vocês.
E é preciso muita cautela! - Inclinou-se para frente e olhou nos olhos dos hobbits. Vigiem cada sombra! - disse ele em voz baixa. - Cavaleiros Negros passaram
por Bri. Na segunda-feira, um desceu pelo Caminho Verde, pelo que dizem; e um outro
apareceu mais tarde, subindo o Caminho Verde vindo do Sul.
Fez-se silêncio. Finalmente Frodo falou para Pippin e Sam: - Deveria ter adivinhado pelo
jeito com que o porteiro nos cumprimentou - disse ele.
- E o proprietário da estalagem parece ter ouvido alguma coisa. Por que fez pressão para
que nos juntássemos ao grupo? E por que raios nos comportamos como perfeitos
idiotas? Deveríamos ter ficado aqui, quietos.
- Teria sido melhor - disse Passolargo. - Eu teria evitado que tivessem ido para a sala
de estar, se pudesse; mas o estalajadeiro não permitiu que eu os encontrasse,
e se recusou a dar qualquer recado.
- Você acha que ele... - começou Frodo.
- Não, não acho que o velho Carrapicho tenha más intenções. É só que ele não gosta nem um
pouco de vagabundos misteriosos como eu. - Frodo olhou para ele intrigado.
- Bem, tenho aparência de patife, não tenho? disse Passolargo, crispando o lábio e com um
brilho estranho nos olhos. #175
Mas espero que possamos nos conhecer melhor. Quando isso acontecer, quero que me explique
o que aconteceu no final da sua canção, pois aquela pequena travessura...
- Foi puro acidente! - interrompeu Frodo.
- Imagino - disse Passolargo. - Acidente, então! Aquele acidente o colocou numa situação
perigosa.
- Não muito mais perigosa do que já era - disse Frodo. - Eu sabia que esses cavaleiros
estavam me perseguindo; mas agora, de qualquer forma, parece que perderam
meu rastro e foram embora.
- Não deve contar com isso! - disse Passolargo categoricamente. Eles voltarão. E mais
estão a caminho. Há outros. Sei quantos são.
Conheço esses Cavaleiros. - Parou,
e seus olhos ficaram frios e duros. - E há algumas pessoas em Bri que não merecem
confiança - continuou ele. Bill Samambaia, por exemplo. Ele tem o nome sujo na
região de Bri, e pessoas estranhas o visitam. Devem tê-lo notado em meio ao grupo: um
sujeito moreno e sarcástico. Estava bastante íntimo de um dos estranhos do
Sul, e eles se esgueiraram para fora logo depois do seu "acidente". Nem todos esses
sulistas têm boas intenções; e quanto a Bill Samambaia, este venderia qualquer
coisa a qualquer pessoa; e seria capaz de fazer maldades só para se divertir.
- O que Samambaia vai vender, e o que o meu acidente tem a ver com ele? - perguntou
Frodo, ainda determinado a não entender as alusões de Passolargo.
- Informações sobre você, é claro - respondeu Passolargo. - Um relatório da sua façanha
seria de grande interesse para certas pessoas. Depois disso nem precisariam
saber seu nome verdadeiro. Parece-me muito provável que saberão de tudo antes do fim da
noite. Já é o bastante? Pode fazer o que bem entender a respeito da minha
recompensa: levar-me como guia ou não. Mas devo dizer que conheço todas as terras entre o
Condado e as Montanhas Sombrias, pois andei por elas durante muitos anos.
Sou mais velho do que pareço. Posso ser útil. Terão que abandonar a estrada aberta depois
do que aconteceu esta noite; os cavaleiros estarão vigiando noite e dia.
Vocês podem escapar de Bri, e conseguir avançar enquanto o sol estiver alto, mas não vão
chegar muito longe. Eles vão alcançá-los num local deserto, em algum lugar
escuro onde não possam conseguir socorro. Querem que os encontrem? Eles são terríveis!
Os hobbits o olhavam, e viam surpresos que seu rosto estava contorcido, como se estivesse
sentindo dores, e as mãos agarravam os braços da poltrona. A sala estava

muito quieta e a luz parecia ter diminuído. Por um tempo, Passolargo ficou parado, com os
olhos distantes, como se vagasse em lembranças longínquas, ou escutasse
ruídos da noite ao longe.
#176
- É isso! - exclamou ele depois de uns momentos, passando a mão sobre a testa. - Talvez
eu saiba mais do que vocês sobre esses perseguidores. Vocês os temem, mas
não os temem o suficiente, ainda. Amanhã terão que escapar, se puderem. Passolargo pode
levar vocês por caminhos que raramente são usados. Vão deixar que os acompanhe?
Houve um silêncio pesado. Frodo não respondeu; tinha a mente confusa, com medo e dúvidas.
Sam franziu a testa, olhou para seu mestre e finalmente falou:
- Com sua permissão, Sr. Frodo, eu diria não! Esse Passolargo, ele nos previne e
recomenda cuidado, e com isso concordo e digo sim; podemos começar por ele. Ele
vem de lugares ermos, e nunca ouvi falar bem de pessoas desse tipo. Ele sabe alguma
coisa, isto é óbvio, e sabe mais do que eu gostaria; mas isso não é motivo para
permitirmos que nos conduza a algum lugar sombrio, onde não haverá socorro, como diz.
Pippin se agitava e parecia inquieto. Passolargo não respondeu a Sam, mas dirigiu o olhar
penetrante para Frodo, que desviou os olhos. - Não disse ele devagar. Não concordo. Eu acho, eu acho que você não é exatamente o que deseja aparentar. Começou
falando comigo como se fosse um habitante de Bri, mas sua voz mudou. Sam
parece estar certo nesse ponto: não vejo por que deva nos prevenir para que tenhamos
cuidado, e mesmo assim pedir que o levemos, sem garantia nenhuma. Por que o
disfarce? Quem é você? O que realmente sabe sobre - sobre meus negócios, e como ficou
sabendo?
- A lição de cautela foi bem aprendida - disse Passolargo, com um sorriso austero. - Mas
ter cautela é uma coisa e vacilar é outra. Nunca chegarão a Valfienda, sozinhos,
e a única chance que têm é confiar em mim. Devem se decidir. Responderei algumas de suas
perguntas, se isso ajudar na decisão. Mas por que acreditariam em minha
história, se ainda não confiam em mim? Mesmo assim, vou lhes contar..
Naquele momento ouviu-se uma batida na porta. O Sr. Carrapicho tinha chegado com velas, e
atrás vinha Nob com canecas de água quente. Passolargo se retirou para
um canto.
- Vim desejar-lhes boa noite - disse o estalajadeiro, colocando as velas nas mesas. Nob, leve a água para os quartos! - Carrapicho entrou
e fechou a porta.
- É o seguinte - começou ele, hesitando e com uma aparência preocupada. - Se lhes causei
algum dano, sinto muito. Mas uma coisa vai em bora com
outra, como devem admitir, e sou um homem ocupado. Mas primeiro uma coisa, e depois outra
nesta semana sacudiram minha memória, como se diz por aí; e espero que
não seja tarde demais. Vejam vocês, alguém
#177
me pediu que eu ficasse de olho nuns hobbits do Condado, especialmente um de nome
Bolseiro.
- E o que isso tem a ver comigo? - perguntou Frodo.
- Não
- Ah, sabe melhor do que eu! - disse o proprietário com astúcia.
vou dar com a língua nos dentes, mas me disseram que esse tal de Bolseiro usaria o nome
de Monteiro, e me deram uma descrição que se encaixa multo bem com o senhor,
se me permite dizer.
- É mesmo? Então quero ouvi-la! - disse Frodo, interrompendo de modo insensato.
- Um sujeitinho troncudo com bochechas vermelhas - disse o Sr. Carrapicho solenemente.
Pippin mal segurava a risada, mas Sam parecia indignado. - Essa descrição
não vai ajudar muito, pois corresponde à maioria dos hobbits, Cevado, diz ele para mim continuou o Sr. Carrapicho, olhando para Pippin. - Mas esse é mais alto
que alguns e mais claro que a maioria, e tem uma covinha no queixo: um camarada
empertigado com olhos brilhantes. Peço desculpas, mas quem disse foi ele, não eu.

- Ele disse? E quem é ele? - perguntou Frodo ansioso.
- Ah, foi Gandalf, se sabe de quem estou falando. Dizem que é um mago, mas é um grande
amigo meu, mago ou não mago. Mas agora já não sei o que ele vai ter para
me dizer, se nos encontrarmos de novo: azedar toda a minha cerveja ou me transformar num
toco de madeira, eu acho. Ele é um pouco precipitado. Mesmo assim, o que
está feito está feito.
- Bem, o que o senhor fez? - disse Frodo, já ficando impaciente com a lenta elucidação
dos pensamentos de Carrapicho.
- Onde eu estava? - disse o proprietário, parando e estalando os dedos. Ah, sim! o velho Gandalf Há três meses ele entrou direto no meu quarto sem
bater. Cevado,
diz ele, vou partir pela manhã. Você poderia fazer-me um favor? É só pedir, disse eu.
Estou compressa, disse ele, e não tenho tempo, mas quero que um recado seja
levado até o Condado. Você tem alguém que Pudesse enviar alguém de confiança? Posso
encontrar alguém, disse eu. Amanhã, talvez, ou depois de amanhã. Faça isso amanhã,
disse ele, e então me deu uma carta.
- O endereço está bem legível - disse o Sr. Carrapicho, tirando uma carta do bolso, e
lendo o endereço lenta e orgulhosamente (dava valor à sua reputação de homem
letrado):
Sr. FRODO BOLSEIRO, BOLSÃO, VILA DOS HOBBITS, no CONDADO.
- Uma carta de GandalP. Para mim! - gritou Frodo.
- Ah! - disse o Sr. Carrapicho. - Então seu nome correto é Bolseiro?
- É - disse Frodo - e é melhor o senhor entregá-la imediatamente, e
#178
explicar por que nunca a enviou. Acho que é isso que veio me dizer, suponho, embora tenha
demorado tanto para chegar ao ponto.
o pobre Sr. Carrapicho parecia embaraçado. - Está certo, senhor - disse ele. - E peço
desculpas. Tenho um medo mortal do que Gandalf vai dizer, se meu esquecimento
causou algum mal. Mas eu não a segurei comigo de propósito. Guardei-a a salvo. Depois não
consegui encontrar ninguém disposto a ir até o Condado no dia seguinte,
nem no outro dia, e não podia dispensar nenhum dos meus empregados; e então uma coisa
atrás da outra afastaram a carta da minha cabeça. Sou um homem ocupado. Vou
fazer o que for possivel para ajeitar as coisas; se houver algo a meu alcance, é só
dizer.
- Deixando a carta de lado, não prometi menos a Gandalf. Cevado, diz ele para mim, esse
meu amigo do Condado, ele pode passar por aqui logo, junto com um outro.
Virá dizendo que seu nome é Monteiro. Não se esqueça disso! Mas você não precisa
perguntar nada. E se eu não estiver com ele, pode ser que ele esteja em apuros,
e precisando de ajuda. Faça por ele o que puder, e eu ficarei grato, diz ele. E aqui está
o senhor, e o apuro parece que não está muito longe.
- Que quer dizer? - perguntou Frodo.
- Esses homens negros - disse o proprietário abaixando a voz. - Estão procurando
Bolseiro, e se as intenções deles são boas,
então sou um hobbit. Foi na segundafeira,
todos os cachorros estavam uivando e os gansos, berrando. Achei estranho. Nob veio e me
disse que dois homens negros estavam na porta perguntando por um hobbit chamado
Bolseiro. O cabelo de Nob estava em pé. E aquele Guardião, Passolargo, também andou
fazendo perguntas. Tentou entrar aqui para vê-lo, antes mesmo que comessem qualquer
coisa.
- Fez isso mesmo - disse Passolargo de repente, dando uns passos à frente e aparecendo na
luz. - E muitos problemas teriam sido evitados se tivesse permitido sua
entrada, Carrapicho.
O estalajadeiro pulou surpreso, - Você! - gritou ele. - Você está sempre aparecendo de
repente.
O que quer agora?
- Ele está aqui com a minha permissão - disse Frodo. - Veio para oferecer ajuda.

- Bem, talvez o senhor saiba o que está fazendo - disse o Sr, Carrapicho, olhando
desconfiado para Passolargo. - Mas se estivesse na sua pele, não me envolveria
com um Guardião.
- Então, ia se envolver com quem? - perguntou Passolargo. - Com um estalajadeiro gordo
que só lembra o próprio nome porque as pessoas o gritam o dia todo? Eles não
podem ficar no Pônei para sempre. Você iria com eles, evitando os homens negros?
- Eu? Deixar Bri? Não faria isso por dinheiro algum - disse o Sr. Carrapicho, parecendo
realmente amedrontado. - Por que o senhor não pode
#179
ficar aqui quietinho por uns tempos, Sr. Monteiro? Que coisas estranhas são estas que
estão acontecendo?
O que esses homens negros querem, e de onde vêm? Gostaria
de saber.
- Sinto muito, mas não posso explicar tudo - respondeu Frodo.
-Estou cansado e
muito preocupado,
E é uma longa história. Mas se quer me ajudar, devo avisá-lo
que estará correndo perigo enquanto eu estiver hospedado em sua casa. Esses Cavaleiros
Negros: não tenho certeza, mas receio que venham de...
- Eles vêm de Mordor - disse Passolargo em voz baixa. - De Mordor,
Carrapicho, se isto quer dizer alguma coisa para você.
- Socorro! - gritou o Sr. Carrapicho, ficando pálido. Evidentemente, conhecia o nome. Esta é a pior notícia que já chegou a Bri desde que me conheço por gente.
- É - disse Frodo. - O senhor ainda está disposto a me ajudar?
- Estou - disse o Sr. Carrapicho. - Mais que nunca. Embora não saiba o que uma pessoa
como eu possa fazer contra, contra... - sua voz falhou.
- Contra a sombra do Leste - disse Passolargo baixinho. - Você não
pode muito, Carrapicho, mas uma coisa pequenajá é de grande ajuda. Você pode permitir que
o Sr. Monteiro fique aqui esta noite, sob esse nome, e pode esquecer o
nome Bolseiro até que ele esteja bem longe.
- Farei isso - disse Carrapicho. - Mas eles não vão precisar da minha
ajuda para descobrir que ele está aqui. É uma pena que o Sr. Bolseiro tenha atraído a
atenção
das pessoas esta noite, para não dizer mais nada. A história sobre a partida daquele Sr.
Bilbo já tinha sido comentada esta noite em Bri. Até mesmo o nosso Nob ficou
fazendo suposições naquele cérebro lento; e outras pessoas em Bri demoram menos para
compreender as coisas.
- Bem, só podemos esperar que os Cavaleiros não voltem tão cedo disse Frodo.
- Espero mesmo que não - disse Carrapicho. - Mas sejam eles assombrações ou não, não vão
entrar no Pônei tão facilmente. Não se preocupem até amanhã cedo. Nob não
vai dizer nada. Os homens pretos só vão entrar aqui por cima de meu cadáver. Eu e meu
pessoal vamos montar guarda esta noite; mas é melhor que vocês durmam, se conseguirem.
- De qualquer modo, deve nos chamar ao amanhecer - disse Frodo. Devemos partir o mais
cedo possível. Sirva o desjejum às seis e meia, por favor.
- Certo! Cuidarei de tudo - disse o proprietário. - Boa noite, Sr. Bolseiro
- deveria dizer, Monteiro. Boa noite agora! Onde está o Sr. Brandebuque?
- Não sei - disse Frodo numa ansiedade repentina. Tinham esquecido
Merry, e estava ficando tarde. - Receio que esteja lá fora. Ele tinha dito algo sobre
sair para tomar ar.
#180
- Bem, não há dúvida de que precisam que cuidemos de vocês: seu grupo se comporta como se
estivesse de férias! - disse Carrapicho. - Preciso ir e trancar as portas
rápido, mas cuidarei para que seu amigo consiga entrar quando voltar. É melhor mandar Nob
procurá-lo. Boa noite para todos!

- Finalmente o Sr. Carrapicho saiu, não sem antes lançar outro olhar desconfiado
para Passolargo, balançando a cabeça. Seus passos se retiraram pelo corredor.
- E então? - disse Passolargo. - Quando é que vai abrir essa carta? Frodo olhou
cuidadosamente o lacre antes de rompê-lo. Certamente, a carta parecia ser de Gandalf
Dentro vinha a seguinte mensagem, na sua letra forte, mas elegante:
PÔNEI SALTITANTE, BRi. Dia do Meio do Ano, Ano do Condado 1418.
Caro Frodo
Recebi uma notícia ruim aqui, e preciso partir imediatamente. É melhor que deixe Bolsão
logo, e saia do Condado o mais tardar antes dofinal de julho. Voltarei logo
que puder e seguirei você, se souber que já partiu. Deixe um recado para mim aqui, se
passarpor Bri. Pode confiar no estalajadeiro (Carrapicho). Você pode encontrar
um amigo meu na Estrada: um homem, esbelto, moreno, alto, que alguns chamam de
Passolargo. Ele estápor dentro de nossos assuntos e ajudará você. Vá para
Valfénda.
Lá espero encontrar você de novo. Se eu não for para lá, Elrond poderá aconselhá-lo.
Um abraço apressado,
GANDALF
ps. NÃo o use novamente, por motivo nenhum! Não viaje à noite!
pps. Certifique-se de que se trata do verdadeiro Passolargo. Há muitos homens estranhos
na estrada.
Seu nome verdadeiro é Aragorn.
Nem tudo que é ouro fulgura, Nem todo o vagante é vadio;
O velho que é forte perdura,
Raiz funda não sofre o frio. Das cinzas um figo há de vir. Das sombras a luz vaijorrar;

PPPS. Espero que Carrapicho envie esta logo. Ele é um homem confiável, mas tem uma
memória que parece um quarto de despejo: nunca encontramos o que precisamos. Se ele
esquecer, voufazer churrasquinho dele.
Até a vista!
Frodo leu a carta e depois passou-a para Pippin e Sam. - Realmente, o velho Carrapicho
fez uma grande confusão! - disse ele. - Merece virar churrasquinho. Se eu
tivesse recebido a carta imediatamente, já poderíamos estar a salvo em Valfenda agora.
Mas o que pode ter acontecido a Gandalf? Ele escreve como se estivesse indo

na direção de um grande perigo.
- Há muitos anos que ele faz isso - disse Passolargo.
Frodo se virou e olhou para ele pensativamente, lembrando-se do segundo P.S. de Gandalf Por que não me disse logo que era amigo de GandalP - perguntou ele. - Teríamos
economizado tempo.
- Será mesmo? Será que vocês teriam acreditado em mim antes deste momento? - disse
Passolargo. - Eu não sabia nada a respeito dessa carta. Tudo o que sabia era que
teria de persuadi-los a confiar em mim sem nenhuma prova, se quisesse ajudá-los, De
qualquer modo, eu não pretendia contar tudo sobre mim de uma só vez, tinha que
observar vocês primeiro, e ter certeza de que realmente se tratava de vocês.
O Inimigo já preparou armadilhas para mim antes. Logo que tomei uma decisão, estava

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
disposto a contar-lhes tudo o que quisessem saber. Mas devo admitir... - acrescentou ele
com um sorriso estranho. - Esperava que gostassem de mim por mim mesmo.
Um homem procurado às vezes se cansa da desconfiança e deseja amizade, Mas, nesse ponto,
acredito que minha aparência não ajude em nada.
Não ajuda mesmo - pelo menos à primeira vista - riu Pippin com um alívio repentino, após
ter lido a carta de Gandalf - Mas beleza não põe mesa, como se diz no Condado;
além disso, arrisco dizer que vamos ficar bem parecidos com você depois de passarmos dias
deitados em cercas-vivas e valas.
- Seriam necessários mais que alguns dias, ou semanas ou anos, vagando pelas Terras
Ermas, para que vocês ficassem parecidos com Passolargo
- respondeu ele. - E morreriam primeiro, a não ser que sejam feitos de uma
matéria mais resistente do que aparentam.
Pippin ficou quieto, mas Sam não se intimidara e ainda olhava Passolargo com
desconfiança. - Como podemos saber que você é o Passolargo de que Gandalf fala? perguntou
ele. - Você nunca mencionou Gandalf, até essa carta aparecer. Deve ser um espião nos
enganando, pelo que vejo, tentando nos convencer a ir
com você. Você deve
ter matado o verdadeiro Passolargo e tomado as roupas dele. Que tem a dizer sobre isso?
- Que você é um sujeito
corajoso - respondeu Passolargo. - Mas receio que minha única
resposta para você, Sam
Gamgi, seja esta: Se eu tivesse matado
#182
o verdadeiro Passolargo, poderia matar vocês. E já teria matado vocês, sem tanto lerolero. Se eu estivesse atrás do Anel, já poderia estar de posse dele - AGORA!
Ficou de pé, e de repente pareceu mais alto. Brilhava em seus olhos uma luz, aguda e
imperiosa. Jogando para trás a capa, colocou a mão no cabo de uma espada que
estava escondida, pendurada ao longo de seu corpo. Eles não ousaram se mexer. Sam ficou
parado, de boca aberta, olhando para ele com ar abobalhado.
- Mas eu sou o verdadeiro Passolargo, felizmente - disse ele, olhando para baixo na
direção deles, suavizando a expressão de seu rosto com um sorriso repentino.
- Sou Aragorn, filho de Arathorn, e se em nome da vida ou da morte puder salvá-los, assim
o farei.
- Acredite! Houve um longo silêncio. Finalmente Frodo falou, hesitando.
que era amigo antes de a carta chegar - disse ele - ou pelo menos desejei acreditar. Você
me assustou várias vezes esta noite, mas nunca da maneira que os servidores
do Inimigo teriam feito, ou pelo menos assim imagino. Acho que um dos espiões dele teria
- bem - uma aparencia melhor e causaria uma sensação pior, se é que me entende.
- Entendo - riu Passolargo. - Tenho uma aparência feia e causo uma sensação boa, não é
isso? Nem tudo o que é ouro,fulgura, nem todo o vagante é vadio.
- Então os versos se aplicavam a você? - perguntou Frodo. - Eu não estava entendendo o
que queriam dizer. Mas como sabia que estava escrito isso na carta de Gandalf?
- Eu não sabia - respondeu ele. - Mas sou Aragon, filho de Arathorn, e esses versos
acompanham meu nome. - Retirou sua espada da bainha, e todos viram que a lâmina
estava de fato quebrada, trinta centímetros abaixo do cabo. - Não tem muita utilidade,
não é Sam? - disse Passolargo. Mas em breve ela será novamente forjada, e
há de, nova, luzir.
Sam não dizia nada.
- Bem - disse Passolargo - com a permissão de Sam, está tudo combinado. Passolargo será o
seu guia. Pegaremos uma estrada difícil amanhã. Mesmo que consigamos deixar
Bri sem dificuldades, não é de esperar que possamos sair sem sermos notados. Mas tentarei
fazer com que nos percam de vista o mais cedo possível. Conheço um ou dois
caminhos que saem desta região sem passar pela estrada principal. Assim que dispersarmos
os perseguidores, iremos em direção ao Topo do Vento.
- Topo do Vento? - disse Sam. - O que é isso?

- É uma colina, ao norte da Estrada, mais ou menos a meio caminho entre Valfenda e Bri.
De lá se pode ter uma boa vista de toda a região, e teremos uma chance de
olhar à nossa volta. Gandalf vai naquela direção, se
#183
for atrás de nós. Depois do Topo do Vento, nossa viagem vai ficar mais dificil, e teremos
de escolher, entre vários perigos, quais iremos enfrentar.
- Quando viu Gandalf pela última vez? - perguntou Frodo. - Sabe onde ele está ou o que
está fazendo?
Passolargo ficou com a expressão séria. - Eu não sei - disse ele. - Vim com ele para o
Oeste na primavera. Freqüentemente eu ficava vigiando os limites do Condado
nesses últimos anos, quando ele estava ocupado em algum outro lugar. Raramente ele
permitia que o Condado ficasse sem proteção. Vimo-nos pela última vez em primeiro
de maio: no Vau Sarn, no Brandevin. Ele me disse que os negócios com você tinham corrido
bem, e que você estaria partindo para Valfenda na primeira semana de
setembro. Como sabia que ele estava ao seu lado, fiz uma viagem por conta própria. E a
coisa não saiu bem; não há dúvida de que ele recebeu alguma notícia, e eu
não estava perto para ajudá-lo.
- Estou preocupado pela primeira vez desde que o conheci. Deveríamos ter recebido
recados, mesmo que ele não pudesse vir em pessoa. Quando voltei, muitos dias atrás,
escutei a notícia ruim. Fiquei sabendo que Gandalf tinha sumido, e que os cavaleiros
tinham sido vistos. Foi o povo élfico de
Gilldor que me contou; e mais tarde
me disseram que você tinha deixado sua casa, mas não soube de notícia alguma sobre sua
partida da Terra dos Buques. Estive de olho na Estrada Leste, ansioso.
- Você acha que os Cavaleiros Negros têm algo a ver com isso - quero dizer, com o
desaparecimento de GandalP - perguntou Frodo.
- Não sei de mais nada que possa tê-lo atrasado, exceto o próprio inimigo - disse
Passolargo. - Mas não perca as esperanças! Gandalf é maior do que vocês, pessoas
do Condado, imaginam - geralmente, conseguem enxergar apenas as piadas e os brinquedos
dele. Mas esse nosso negócio será sua maior tarefa.
Pippin bocejou. - Sinto muito - disse ele. - Mas estou morto de cansaço. Apesar de todo
perigo e preocupação, preciso ir para a cama, ou vou dormir sentado aqui
mesmo. Cadê aquele tolo do Merry? Seria a gota d'água, se tivéssemos de sair no escuro
para procurá-lo.
Naquele momento, escutaram uma porta bater; depois, passos vieram correndo ao longo do
corredor. Merry entrou como um raio, seguido de Nob. Fechou a porta num segundo
e depois se encostou nela. Estava sem fôlego. Todos olharam-no alarmados por um momento;
depois ele disse, ofegante: -Eu os vi, Frodo! Eu os vi! Os Cavaleiros Negros!
- Os Cavaleiros Negros? Onde?
-Aqui, na aldeia. Fiquei aqui dentro por uma hora. Então, como vocês não voltavam, saí
para dar um passeio. Tinha acabado de voltar e estava parado fora do alcance
da luz da lamparina, para ver as estrelas. De repente,
#184
comecei a tremer e senti que alguma coisa horrível se aproximava sorrateiramente: havia
um tipo de sombra mais profunda entre as sombras na estrada, bem atrás da
área iluminada pela lamparina. Essa sombra sumiu na escuridão imediatamente, sem fazer um
ruído. Não vi cavalos.
- Para que lado essa coisa foi? - perguntou Passolargo, repentina e abruptamente.
Merry se assustou, ao notar o estranho pela primeira vez. - Continue
- disse Frodo. - Este é um amigo de Gandalf. Depois eu explico.
- Parece que ela subiu a Estrada, em direção ao leste - continuou Merry.
- Tentei ir atrás. Mas é claro que desapareceu quase imediatamente; mesmo assim,
contornei a esquina e continuei até a última casa da Estrada.

Passolargo olhou para Merry admirado. - Você tem um coraçao valente - disse ele. - Mas
foi tolice sua!
- Eu não sei - disse Merry. - Não foi coragem nem tolice, eu acho. Mal pude me controlar.
Parecia que eu estava sendo arrastado para algum lugar. De qualquer modo
fui, e de repente ouvi vozes perto da cerca-viva. Uma delas murmurava; a outra
cochichava, ou chiava. Não pude entender nada do que falaram. Não me aproximei mais,
porque meu corpo inteiro começou a tremer. Então fiquei apavorado, e voltei, e já ia
fugir para casa quando alguma coisa veio atrás de mim e eu... eu caí.
- Eu o encontrei, senhor - acrescentou Nob. - O Sr. Carrapicho me mandou com uma
lanterna. Desci até o Portal Oeste, e depois subi de novo até o Portal Sul. Bem
na altura da casa de Bill Samambaia, tive a impressão de ver alguma coisa na Estrada. Não
poderia jurar, mas me pareceu que dois homens estavam se agachando sobre
alguma coisa, para levantá-la. Dei um grito, mas quando cheguei ao lugar, não vi sinal
deles; vi apenas o Sr. Brandebuque, deitado à margem da Estrada. Parecia estar
dormindo. "Pensei que estivesse numa enrascada", disse-me ele, quando o sacudi. Estava
muito esquisito, e assim que o despertei, ficou de pé e correu para cá como
uma lebre.
- Receio que seja isso - disse Merry. - Mas não tenho idéia do que falei. Tive um sonho
feio, do qual não me recordo. Fiquei em frangalhos. Não sei o que aconteceu
comigo.
- Eu sei - disse Passolargo. - O Hálito Negro. Os Cavaleiros devem ter deixado os cavalos
do lado de fora, Passando pelo Portal Sul em segredo. Agora vão saber tudo
o que aconteceu, pois visitaram Bill Samambaia; e provavelmente aquele sulista também era
um espião. Pode ser que aconteça alguma coisa, antes que deixemos Bri.
- O que vai acontecer? - disse Merry. - Eles vão atacar a estalagem?
- Não, acho que não - disse Passolargo. - Ainda não estão todos aqui. E, de qualquer
modo, não é assim que eles agem. Na solidão e no escuro são mais fortes; não
vão abertamente atacar uma casa onde haja luzes e muitas
#185
pessoas - pelo menos até que estejam desesperados. Não enquanto tivermos todas as longas
milhas até Eriador à nossa frente. Mas o poder deles está no terror, e alguns
aqui em Bri já estão sob as suas garras. Eles vão obrigar esses infelizes a fazer algum
serviço maldoso: Samambaia, alguns daqueles estranhos, e talvez o porteiro
também. Eles trocaram palavras com Harry no Portal Oeste, na segunda-feira. Eu estava
vigiando. Harry estava pálido e tremia quando o deixaram.
- Parece que temos inimigos por todo lado - disse Frodo. - Que devemos fazer?
- Fiquem aqui, e não vão para seus quartos! É certeza que eles já sabem onde vocês devem
dormir. Os quartos de hobbits têm janelas voltadas para o norte, e ficam
junto ao solo. Vamos ficar todos juntos, e bloquear essa janela e a porta. Mas primeiro
Nob e eu vamos trazer sua bagagem.
Enquanto Passolargo fazia isso, Frodo contou rapidamente a Merry tudo o que tinha
acontecido desde a ceia. Merry ainda estava lendo a carta de Gandalf e pensando
quando Passolargo e Nob voltaram.
- Bem, senhores - disse Nob. - Amassei os lençóis e coloquei uma almofada deitada em cada
cama. E fiz uma bela imitação de sua cabeça com um tapete de lã marrom,
Sr. Bol - Monteiro - acrescentou ele, sorrindo.
Pippin riu. - O disfarce parece perfeito! - disse ele. - Mas o que vai acontecer quando
eles descobrirem tudo?
- Vamos ver - disse Passolargo. - Espero que consigamos defender nossa fortaleza até
amanhã.
- Boa noite a todos - disse Nob, e saiu para fazer seu turno na guarda das portas.
da sala. As mochilas
e o resto da bagagem foram empilhados no chão.
Empurraram uma poltrona baixa contra a porta e fecharam a janela. Espiando lá fora, Frodo
viu que a noite ainda estava clara. A
Foice pendia clara sobre as encostas

da Colina de Bri. Então ele fechou e bloqueou as pesadas folhas interiores da janela,
cerrando depois a cortina. Passolargo reavivou o fogo e apagou as velas.
Os hobbits deitaram em seus cobertores com os pés virados para a lareira; Passolargo se
acomodou na poltrona em frente à porta. Conversaram um pouco, pois Merry
tinha ainda muitas perguntas a fazer.
- A vaca pula pra Lua! - disse Merry sufocando a risada, e seenrolando
no cobertor. - Isso foi ridículo, Frodo! Mas eu queria estar lá para ver. As pessoas
ilustres de Bri ainda vão estar comentando isso daqui a cem anos.
- Espero que sim - disse Passolargo. Depois todos ficaram quietos, e os hobbits, um por
um, adormeceram.

CAPITULO X1
UMA FACA NO ESCURO
#187
Enquanto na estalagem em Bri eles se preparavam para dormir, a escuridão cobria a Terra
dos Buques; uma névoa se espalhava pelos vales estreitos e nas margens do
rio. A casa em Cricôncavo permanecia em silêncio. Fatty Bolger abriu a porta com cuidado
e espiou lá fora. Durante todo o dia, um sentimento de pavor estivera crescendo
dentro dele, o que o impedia de descansar ou dormir: havia uma ameaça crescente no ar
parado da noite. Olhando através da escuridão, viu uma sombra negra se mover
sob as árvores; teve a impressão de que o portão se abriu sozinho e se fechou de novo sem
fazer barulho algum. Foi tomado de pânico. Recuou e por um momento ficou
parado no salão, tremendo. Depois fechou e trancou a porta.
A noite ficou mais escura. Um ruído suave de cavalos furtivamente conduzidos vinha da
alameda. Pararam do lado de fora do portão, e três figuras negras entraram,
como sombras noturnas se arrastando pelo chão. Uma delas se dirigiu à porta, e as outras
foram uma para cada canto da casa, ficando as três ali, paradas como sombras
de pedras, enquanto a noite passava lentamente. A casa e as árvores quietas pareciam
estar à espera, ansiosas.
As folhas se moviam muito levemente, e um galo cantou na distância. A hora fria que
antecipa a aurora estava passando. A figura perto da porta se mexeu. Na escuridão
sem lua ou estrela uma lâmina brilhou, como se uma luz gelada tivesse sido desembainhada.
Houve uma batida, surda mas pesada, e a porta tremeu.
-Abra, em nome de Mordor! - disse uma voz aguda e ameaçadora. Ao segundo golpe, a porta
cedeu, caindo para trás com os batentes destruídos e a fechadura quebrada.
As figuras negras entraram rápido.
Naquele exato momento, por entre as árvores na redondeza, uma corneta soou. Rasgou a
noite como o fogo no topo de uma colina.
ACORDEM! FACA! FOGO! FúRIA! ACORDEM!
Fatty Bolger não tinha ficado parado. Assim que viu as formas escuras saindo sorrateiras
do jardim, percebeu que devia fugir correndo, ou então morreria. E de fato
correu, saindo pela porta traseira, indo através do jardim e atravessando as plantações.
Quando atingiu a casa mais próxima, a mais de uma milha, caiu na porta de
entrada. - Não, não, não! - gritava ele. Não, eu não! Não está comigo! - Demorou um tempo
até alguém entender

o que ele estava balbuciando. Finalmente perceberam que havia inimigos na Terra dos
Buques, alguma estranha invasão que vinha da Floresta Velha. E então não perderam
tempo.
FACA! FOGO! FúRIA!
Os Brandebuques estavam soando o toque de corneta da Terra dos Buques, que não se ouvia
havia mais de um século, desde a invasão dos lobos brancos durante o Inverno
Mortal, quando o Brandevin ficou congelado.
ACORDEM! ACORDEM!
Na distância, cornetas soavam em resposta. O alarme estava se espalhando. As figuras
negras fugiram da casa. Uma delas deixou cair uma capa de hobbit na escada,
ao sair correndo. Na alameda, irrompeu o ruído de cascos, que se apressavam num galope,
martelando o chão e se distanciando no escuro. Por toda a volta de Cricôncavo
ouvia-se o ruído de cornetas tocando, e vozes gritando e pés correndo. Mas os Cavaleiros
Negros correram como o vento para o Portão Norte. Podiam deixar os pequenos
tocando as cornetas! Sauron cuidaria deles mais tarde. Por enquanto, tinham outra missão:
sabiam que a casa estava vazia e o Anel tinha desaparecido. Atropelaram
os guardas do portão e desapareceram do Condado.
Pouco tempo depois de se deitar, Frodo despertou de um sono profundo, de repente, como se
algum ruído ou presença o tivesse perturbado. Viu que Passolargo estava
sentado, alerta, em sua cadeira: os olhos brilhavam à luz do fogo que, reavivado,
queimava forte; mas ele não fez qualquer sinal ou movimento.
Frodo logo adormeceu de novo, mas seus sonhos foram mais uma vez perturbados pelo ruído
de vento e de cascos que galopavam.
O vento parecia envolver a casa e sacudi-la;
na distância ele ouviu uma corneta tocando freneticamente. Abriu os olhos, e ouviu um
galo cantando alto no pátio da estalagem. Passolargo abrira a cortina e empurrara
as folhas das janelas ruidosamente. A primeira luz do dia, cinzenta, penetrou na sala, e
um ar frio entrou pela janela aberta.
Logo que Passolargo tinha acordado a todos, levou-os até seus quartos. Quando os viram,
sentiram-se felizes por terem seguido o conselho do Guardião: as janelas
tinham sido forçadas, e as folhas abertas estavam batendo, as cortinas esvoaçavam; as
camas tinham sido reviradas e as almofadas, rasgadas e jogadas no chão; o tapete
marrom estava estraçalhado.
#189
Passolargo foi imediatamente chamar o estalajadeiro. O pobre Sr. Carrapicho parecia estar
sonolento e amedrontado. Mal tinha cerrado os olhos durante toda a noite
(pelo menos assim afirmava), mas não ouvira barulho algum.
- Jamais uma coisa assim aconteceu na minha vida! - gritava ele, levantando as mãos
horrorizado. - Hóspedes que não podem dormir em seus quartos, e boas almofadas
completamente estragadas! Que tempos são estes?
- Tempos sombrios - disse Passolargo. - Mas por enquanto você pode ficar em paz, depois
que tiver se livrado de nós. Vamos partir imediatamente. Não se incomode
com o desjejw-um : um gole e um lambisco, em pé, vão ser o suficiente. Temos poucos
minutos para aprontar a bagagem.
O Sr. Carrapicho se apressou para providenciar que os pôneis ficassem prontos e para
trazer-lhes um
"lambisco". Mas logo voltou desanimado. Os pôneis tinham desaparecido!
As portas do estábulo tinham todas sido arrombadas durante a noite, e eles não estavam
mais lá: não apenas os pôneis de Merry, mas todos os outros cavalos ou animais
do lugar.
Frodo ficou arrasado com a notícia. Como podiam ter esperanças de chegar a Valfenda a pé,
perseguidos por inimigos a cavalo? Era melhor partirem para a Lua! Passolargo
ficou sentado quieto por um tempo, olhando os hobbits, como se medisse a força e a
coragem deles.
Pôneis não nos ajudariam a escapar de homens montados em cavalos

- disse ele finalmente, pensativo, como se adivinhasse o que Frodo estava pensando. - Não
levaríamos muito mais tempo a pé, não nas estradas que pretendo tomar.
De qualquer modo, eu ia caminhar. A comida e as provisões é que são o problema. Não
podemos contar com a possibilidade de comer qualquer coisa antes de chegarmos
a Valfenda, a não ser o que levarmos conosco; devemos levar mais do que achamos que vamos
precisar, pois podemos nos atrasar, ou ser forçados a fazer um trajeto
maior, saindo do caminho direto. Quanto podem carregar nas costas?
- O tanto que precisarmos - disse Pippin com o coração pesado, mas tentando mostrar que
era mais forte do que parecia (ou sentia) ser.
- Posso carregar o suficiente para dois - disse Sam em desafio.
Não se pode fazer alguma coisa, Sr. Carrapicho? - perguntou Frodo.
- Não podemos conseguir uns dois pôneis na aldeia, ou pelo menos um, para levar a
bagagem? Não acho que possamos alugá-los, mas acho que podemos comprá-los - acrescentou
sem certeza, pensando se poderia pagar o preço pedido.
- Duvido - disse o proprietário tristemente. - Os dois ou tres poneis de montar que havia
em Bri estavam no meu estábulo, e eles se foram. Quanto a outros animais,
cavalos ou pôneis, o que quer que seja, há muito poucos deles em Bri, e não estarão à
venda. Mas farei o que puder. Vou tirar Bob da cama e mandá-lo por aí o mais
rápido possível.
#190
- Sim - disse Passolargo, relutante. - É melhor fazer isso. Acho que devemos tentar levar
pelo menos um pônei. Mas, por outro lado, perdemos toda a esperança de
partir cedo, e escapar em segredo! Era melhor tocar uma corneta para anunciar nossa
partida. Isso foi parte do plano deles, sem dúvida.
- Há uma migalha de conforto - disse Merry. - E mais que uma migalha, eu espero: podemos
tomar o desjejum enquanto esperamos - e sentados. Vamos chamar o Nob.
No fim, foram mais de três horas de atraso. Bob veio com a notícia de que não havia
cavalo ou pônei dejeito nenhum na vizinhança - com a exceção de um: Bill Samambaia
tinha um pônei que poderia vender. - Um pobre animal, meio morto de fome - disse Bob. Mas Samambaia não vai se separar dele por menos do triplo de seu valor, sabendo
da sua situação; não se o conheço de verdade.
- Bill Samambaia - disse Frodo. - Será que isso é algum truque? Será
que o animal não fugiria de volta para ele com todas as nossas coisas, ou poderia ajudálo a nos seguir, ou alguma coisa do tipo?
- Fico pensando - disse Passolargo. - Mas não posso imaginar qualquer animal correndo de
volta para casa, para o encontro dele, uma vez que tivesse fugido. Acho
que é só malícia do senhor Samambaia: apenas um jeito de aumentar os lucros com essa
história toda.
O maior perigo é que o pobre animal esteja quase morrendo. Mas
parece que não há outra escolha. Quanto ele quer pelo pônei?
O preço que Bill Samambaia deu foi doze moedas de prata; isso é realmente pelo menos o
triplo do valor de um pônei naquelas partes. Era um animal magro, mal-alimentado
e abatido, mas não tinha jeito de quem ia morrer logo. O próprio Sr. Carrapicho pagou
pelo animal, e ofereceu a Merry mais dezoito moedas, para de certo modo compensar
a perda dos pôneis. Era um homem honesto, e rico para os parâmetros de Bri; mas trinta
moedas de prata foram um golpe para ele, e ser trapaceado por Samambaia tornava
tudo ainda mais dificil de agüentar.
Para falar a verdade, no final ele levou a melhor. Descobriu-se que apenas um cavalo fora
realmente roubado. Os outros tinham sido afugentados, ou tinham fugido
apavorados, e foram encontrados, vagando em diferentes lugares da região. Os pôneis de
Merry tinham escapado juntos, e finalmente (tendo uma boa dose de bom senso)
foram em direção às Colinas, à procura de Bolo-fofo. Por isso, ficaram aos cuidados de
Tom Bombadil por uns
tempos, e estavam em ótimas condições. Mas quando a notícia dos acontecimentos em Bri
chegou aos ouvidos de Tom, ele os enviou para o Sr. Carrapicho,
que agora tinha adquirido cinco bons animais a um ótimo preço.

Em Bri eles tinham de trabalhar mais, mas Bob tratava bem deles; somando tudo, tiveram
sorte: perderam uma viagem escura e perigosa. Mas jamais chegaram a Valfenda.
Entretanto, nesse meio tempo, o Sr. Carrapicho ficou achando que seu dinheiro tinha-se
ido de verdade, e que talvez tivesse feito um mau negócio. E ele teve outros
problemas. Pois houve uma grande agitação, logo que os outros hóspedes acordaram e
souberam da notícia do ataque à
estalagem. os viajantes do Sul tinham perdido
muitos cavalos, e punham a culpa no proprietário em voz alta, até que ficaram sabendo que
uma pessoa de seu próprio grupo também tinha desaparecido, justamente o
companheiro vesgo de Bill Samambaia. A suspeita recaiu imediatamente sobre ele.
- Se vocês pegam um ladrão de cavalos, e o trazem para minha casa
- disse Carrapicho furioso -, vocês mesmos têm de pagar por todos os prejuízos, e não vir
gritando em cima de mim. Vão perguntar a Samambaia onde o seu belo amigo
está! - Mas, ao que parecia, o fugitivo não era amigo de ninguém, e nenhum deles podia se
lembrar de quando se juntara ao grupo.
Depois do desjejum os hobbits tiveram de rearrumar as mochilas e juntar mais suprimentos
para a viagem mais longa que agora estavam esperando. Eram quase dez horas
quando conseguiram partir. Nessa hora, toda a Bri fervilhava, excitada.
O truque de desaparecimento de Frodo, o aparecimento dos cavaleiros negros; o assalto aos
estábulos, e mais ainda a notícia de que Passolargo, o Guardião, tinha se juntado aos
misteriosos hobbits, deram uma história e tanto, que iria durar por muitos
anos enfadonhos. A maioria dos habitantes de Bri e Estrado, e muitos até de Valão e
Archet, se acotovelavam na estrada para ver a partida dos viajantes. Os outros
hóspedes da estalagem estavam nas portas ou pendurados nas janelas.
Passolargo tinha mudado de idéia, e decidira deixar Bri pela Estrada Principal. Qualquer
tentativa de atravessar o campo imediatamente só pioraria as coisas: metade
dos habitantes os seguiria, para ver o que iriam fazer, e impedir que invadissem suas
terras.
Disseram adeus a Nob e Bob, e se despediram do Sr. Carrapicho com muitos agradecimentos.
- Espero que possamos nos encontrar de novo algum dia, quando as coisas
estiverem bem outra vez - disse Frodo. - Nada seria melhor para mim do que ficar em sua
casa por uns tempos, em paz.
Foram pisando firme, ansiosos e melancólicos, sob os olhos da multidão. Nem todos os
rostos eram amigáveis, muito menos as palavras gritadas. Mas Passolargo parecia
ser respeitado pela maioria dos habitantes de Bri, e aqueles para quem ele olhava
fechavam as bocas e se afastavam. Ele ia na frente com Frodo; depois vinham Merry
e Pippin, e por último Sam trazendo o pônei, carregado com toda a bagagem que tiveram a
coragem de colocar em seu lombo; mesmo assim, o animal já parecia menos abatido,
#192
como se aprovasse a mudança em sua sorte. Sam mastigava uma maça pensativamente. Trazia
muitas no bolso: um presente de despedida de Nob e Bob. - Maçãs para caminhar
e cachimbo para descansar - disse ele. - Mas acho que logo sentirei falta das duas
coisas.
Conforme iam passando, os hobbits não tomavam conhecimento das cabeças curiosas que
espiavam das portas, ou surgiam sobre muros ou cercas. Mas chegando perto do
outro portal, Frodo viu uma casa escura e malcuidada atrás de uma cerca-víva espessa: a
última casa da aldeia. Em uma das janelas, viu de relance um rosto amarelento,
com olhos furtivos, vesgos; o rosto desapareceu imediatamente.
"Então é aí que o sulista está escondido!", pensou ele. "Ele se parece muito com um ore."
Sobre a cerca-viva, um outro homem os encarava com atrevimento. Tinha sobrancelhas negras
e grossas, e olhos escuros e desdenhosos; sua grande boca se crispou numa
expressão zombeteira. Estava fumando um cachimbo preto e curto. Quando se aproximaram,
tirou-o da boca e cuspiu.

- Dia, Perna Comprida! - disse ele. - Já de saída? Finalmente encontrou alguns amigos? Passolargo fez um sinal afirmativo com a cabeça, mas não respondeu.
- Dia, meus amiguinhos! - disse ele aos outros. - Suponho que sabem com quem estão se
metendo? Com Passolargo, o Destemido! Mas eu já ouvi outros nomes não tão bonitos,
Cuidado esta noite! E você, Sammie, não trate mal meu pobre e velho pônei - completou
ele, cuspindo mais uma vez.
Sam se voltou rápido. - E você, Samambaia - disse ele -, tire sua cara feia da frente, ou
ela vai ficar quebrada. - Num golpe repentino, rápido como um raio, uma
maçã deixou sua mão, para bater no meio do nariz de Bill. Ele se abaixou tarde demais, e
pragas vieram de trás da cerca. - Desperdicei uma boa maçã - disse Sam arrependido,
e continuou andando.
Finalmente deixaram a aldeia para trás. A escolta de crianças e vagabundos que os tinha
seguido se cansou e virou as costas, ao chegar no Portão Sul. Passando
por ele, continuaram na Estrada por algumas milhas. Ela fazia uma curva para a esquerda,
dobrando-se sobre si mesma em direção ao leste, conforme contornava o sopé
da Colina Bri, e depois começava a descer suavemente em direção a uma região de
florestas. À esquerda, ainda podiam ver algumas casas e tocas de hobbits de Estrado,
nas encostas mais suaves, do lado sudoeste da colina; abaixo, num vale profundo ao norte
da Estrada, havia fios de fumaça subindo, indicando a localização de Valão;
Archet estava escondida pelas árvores adiante.
Depois de descerem pela estrada determinado trecho, e deixarem a Colina Bri, erguendo-se
alta e escura lá atrás, chegaram a uma trilha estreita
#193
que conduzia em direção ao Norte. - É aqui que vamos deixar o espaço aberto e procurar
abrigo - disse Passolargo.
- Nenhum "atalho", suponho! - disse Pippin. - Nosso último atalho pela floresta quase
acabou em desastre.
- Ah, mas eu não estava com vocês - riu Passolargo. - Meus caminhos, atalhos ou não, não
dão errado. - Olhou a Estrada de cima a baixo. Não se via ninguém; ele foi
na frente apressado, indicando o caminho em direção ao vale cheio de árvores.
Seu plano, pelo que os outros podiam entender sem conhecer a região, era ir em direção a
Archet primeiro, mas manter a direita e passar pela aldeia do lado leste,
e então atravessar o mais diretamente possível as terras selvagens, até chegar ao Topo do
Vento. Fazendo esse caminho, se tudo corresse bem, provavelmente evitariam
uma grande volta que a Estrada dava em direção ao Sul, para desviar do Pântano dos
Mosquitos. Mas, é claro, eles não agüentariam passar pelo pântano sozinhos, e
a descrição feita por Passolargo não era nada encorajadora.
Entretanto, nesse meio tempo, caminhar não era desagradável. Na verdade, se não fosse
pelos acontecimentos
incômodos da noite anterior, eles teriam apreciado mais
essa parte da viagem do que qualquer outra até aquele momento. O sol brilhava, claro mas
não quente demais. As florestas no vale ainda estavam cheias de folhas e
de cores, e pareciam pacíficas e benéficas. Passolargo os conduzia confiante, entre
várias trilhas que se entrecruzavam. Se estivessem sozinhos, logo perderiam
a noção do caminho e ficariam perdidos. Ele os levava num curso errante, com muitas
viravoltas, para enganar qualquer um que os perseguisse.
- Bill Samambaia certamente viu em que ponto deixamos a Estrada disse ele. - Mas não acho
que nos seguirá em pessoa. Ele conhece a região por aqui o suficiente,
mas sabe também que não é páreo para mim numa floresta. É do que ele pode contar a outros
que tenho medo. Não acho que estejam muito longe. Se estão pensando que
fomos para Archet, tanto melhor.
Talvez por causa da habilidade de Passolargo, ou talvez por outro motivo, eles não viram
sinal ou ouviram ruído algum de qualquer outra coisa viva por todo aquele
dia: nenhum ser de duas pernas, com a exceção de pássaros, nem seres de quatro pernas, a
não ser uma raposa e alguns esquilos. No dia seguinte começaram a rumar

por um caminho que conduzia sempre em direção ao leste; e ainda assim tudo estava quieto
e pacífico. No terceiro dia fora de Bri, saíram da Floresta Chet.
O terreno
descera continuamente, desde que saíram da Estrada, e agora entravam numa região ampla e
plana, muito mais dificil de atravessar. Estavam muito além das fronteiras
da região de Bri, num lugar deserto e sem trilhas, e se aproximavam do Pântano dos
Mosquitos.
#194
Agora o solo se tornava úmido, e em alguns lugares lamacento, formando poças aqui e ali,
e eles deparavam com grandes trechos de juncos, cheios do trinar de pequenos
pássaros escondidos. Tinham de escolher cuidadosamente onde pisavam, para manterem os pés
secos e não se desviarem do caminho. No início fizeram um bom progresso,
mas à medida que continuavam, sua passagem foi ficando mais lenta e perigosa.
O pântano era enganador e traiçoeiro, e não havia trilha permanente, nem mesmo para
os Guardiões, porque os charcos sempre mudavam de lugar. As moscas começavam a atormentálos, e o ar se enchia de nuvens de pequenos mosquitos que lhes subiam pelas
mangas e lhes entravam nos cabelos.
- Estou sendo devorado vivo! - gritou Pippin. - Pântano dos Mosquitos! Aqui tem mais
mosquito que pântano!
- O que comem para sobreviver quando não conseguem pegar um hobbit? - disse Sam, coçando
o pescoço.
Passaram um dia miserável naquele local solitário e desagradável. O lugar onde acamparam
era úmido, frio e desconfortável; os insetos picadores não os deixavam dormir,
Também havia criaturas abomináveis assombrando os juncos e moitas que, pelo ruído que
produziam, eram parentes malignos do
grilo. Havia milhares delas, chiando por
toda a parte, crique-craque, crique-craque, sem parar, toda a noite, deixando os hobbits
quase malucos.
O dia seguinte, o quarto, foi um pouco melhor, e a noite quase tão desconfortável.
Embora os Crique-craques (como Sam os chamava) tivessem sido deixados para trás,
os mosquitos ainda os perseguiam.
Frodo, que estava deitado mas era incapaz de fechar os olhos, teve a impressão de que na
distância havia uma luz no céu do Leste: piscando e sumindo várias vezes.
Não era a aurora, pois ainda faltavam algumas horas.
- Que é essa luz? - disse ele a Passolargo, que tinha se levantado e estava parado,
olhando para frente, dentro da noite.
- Não sei - respondeu Passolargo. - Está longe demais para que se possa distinguir. É
como um raio que saí pulando do topo das colinas. Frodo se deitou de novo,
mas por um bom tempo ainda pôde ver os clarões brancos, e contra eles a figura alta e
escura de Passolargo, parado
quieto e atento. Finalmente adormeceu e entrou num sono agitado.
Não tinham avançado muito no quinto dia quando deixaram as últimas poças e juncos dos
pântanos para trás. A região diante deles começou a subir continuamente. Agora,
no horizonte ao leste, podiam ver uma fileira de colinas. A mais alta delas ficava à
direita e um pouco separada das outras. Tinha um topo em forma de cone, levemente
aplainado na parte mais alta.
- Aquele é o Topo do Vento - disse Passolargo. - A Estrada Velha, que deixamos lá atrás à
nossa direita, passa ao sul dele perto de
#195
sua base. Chegaremos lá amanhã por volta do meio-dia, se formos reto naquela direçao.
Suponho que seja o melhor a fazer.
- o que está querendo dizer? - perguntou Frodo.
- Quero dizer: quando chegarmos lá, não há certeza do que podemos encontrar.
O Topo fica perto da Estrada.

- Mas certamente estávamos com esperanças de encontrar Gandalf lá.
- Sim, mas a esperança é pequena. Se é que ele está vindo para cá, pode ser que não passe
por Bri, e assim não saberá o que estamos fazendo. E, de qualquer forma,
a não ser que por sorte cheguemos lá quase juntos, não nos encontraremos; não será seguro
para
ele ou para nós permanecer ali esperando por muito tempo. Se os Cavaleiros não
conseguirem nos encontrar na região deserta, é provável que também se dirijam para o Topo
do Vento. De lá se tem uma vista completa. Na verdade, há muitos pássaros
e animais nessa regiao que poderiam nos ver aqui onde estamos, de lá da colina. Nem todos
os pássaros são confiáveis, e existem outros espiões mais maldosos do que
esses.
Os hobbíts olhavam as colinas distantes cheios de ansiedade. Sam olhou para o céu claro,
receando ver falcões ou águias sobrevoando suas cabeças, com olhos brilhantes
e hostis. - Você realmente faz com que eu me sinta mal e solitário, Passolargo! - disse
ele.
- O que nos aconselha a fazer? - perguntou Frodo.
- Eu acho - respondeu Passolargo devagar, como se não tivesse muita certeza. - Eu acho
que a melhor coisa a fazer é ir direto para o leste saindo daqui, o mais direto
que pudermos, andando na direção das colinas, e não do Topo do Vento. Ali poderemos pegar
uma trilha que passa pelo sopé das colinas; ela nos levará ao Topo do Vento
pelo lado norte, e não tão abertamente. Ali decidiremos o que fazer.
Avançaram durante todo o dia, até que a noite fria começou a cair precocemente.
O solo ficou mais seco e estéril, mas havia névoa e vapor depositados sobre os pântanos
atrás deles, Alguns pássaros melancólicos piavam chorosos, até que o sol redondo e
vermelho se afundou lentamente nas sombras do oeste; depois dominou o silêncio
vazio. Os hobbits, pensaram na luz suave do pôr-do-sol brilhando através das janelas
alegres lá longe, em Bolsão.
No fim do dia depararam com uma corrente de água que descia das colinas para se perder no
charco estagnado, e subiram ao longo de suas margens enquanto havia luz.
Já era noite quando finalmente pararam e montaram acampamento sob alguns armeiros
raquíticos próximos à beira da água. À frente, soerguiam-se sobre o céu crepuscular
as encostas das montanhas, desertas e nuas. Naquela noite montaram guarda, e Passolargo,
ao que tudo
#196
indica, não dormiu nem um pouco. Estavam na lua crescente e, nas primeiras horas da
noite, uma luz fria e cinzenta se deitou sobre a terra.
Na manhã seguinte partiram novamente, logo após o nascer do sol. O ar estava gelado e o
céu ostentava um azul claro e pálido. Os hobbits se sentiam reconfortados,
como se tivessem tido uma noite de sono contínuo. Já estavam se acostumando a fazer
longas caminhadas sem muitas provisões . provisões bem menos generosas do que
aquelas que no Condado teriam Julgado estritamente suficientes para manter um hobbit em
pé. Pippin declarou que Frodo atualmente era duas vezes o hobbit de outrora.
- Muito estranho - disse Frodo, apertando o cinto. - Considerando que na verdade há uma
porção muito menor de mim. Espero que o processo de emagrecimento não perdure
indefinidamente, senão me transformarei num espectro.
- Não fique falando nessas coisas! - disse Passolargo de modo rápido, com um ar
surpreendentemente sério.
As montanhas se aproximaram. Formavam uma cordilheira ondulada, sempre subindo a uma
altura de quase 300 metros, para depois cair, aqui e acolá, formando fendas
baixas ou passagens que levavam para a terra do Leste, mais além. Ao longo da crista da
cordilheira, os hobbits podiam ver o que parecia ser o resto de muralhas
e fossos cobertos de mato, e nas fendas ainda existiam ruínas de velhas construções de
pedra. Ao anoitecer já tinham atingido o pé das encostas oeste, e ali acamparam.
Era a noite do dia cinco de outubro, e já fazia seis dias que tinham saído de Bri.
De manhã encontraram, pela primeira vez desde que deixaram a Floresta Chet, uma trilha
bem visível. Viraram para a direita e seguiram por ela, em direção ao sul.

A trilha parecia ter sido feita com grande habilidade, descrevendo uma linha que parecia
escolher os pontos menos expostos e mais ocultos, tanto para alguém que
olhasse do topo de alguma colina como para quem olhasse das planícies do Oeste.
Mergulhava em vales estreitos, abraçava barrancos íngremes; quando atravessava trechos
mais planos e abertos, viam-se de seus dois lados fileiras de grandes seixos e pedras
cortadas, que protegiam os viajantes quase como uma cerca-viva.
- Fico pensando quem teria feito esta trilha, e por que motivo - disse Merry, enquanto
caminhavam por uma dessas avenidas, onde as pedras eram estranhamente grandes
e colocadas bem próximas umas das outras. Não tenho certeza se gosto dela: ela tem...
bem, uma aparência tumulesca. Existe algum túmulo no Topo do Vento?
- Não, não há túmulo nenhum no Topo do Vento, nem nas outras colinas - respondeu
Passolargo. - Os homens do Oeste não viveram aqui, embora nos seus últimos dias
tenham defendido as colinas por um período,
#197
contra o mal que vinha de Angmar. Esta trilha foi feita para servir os fortes ao longo
das muralhas. Mas muito antes, nos dias do Reinado
do Norte, construíram
uma grande torre de observação no Topo do Vento, que chamavam de Amon
SU. Ela foi queimada e destruída, e nada mais resta agora, a não ser um círculo em
ruínas, como
uma coroa grosseira sobre a cabeça da velha colina. Apesar disso, já foi alta e bonita.
Conta-se que Elendil ficava ali olhando, à espera de
Gil-galad que vinha
do Oeste, nos dias da última Aliança.
os hobbits olharam para Passolargo. Parecia que ele sabia tanto de históri a antiga
quanto dos caminhos pelos lugares ermos. - Quem foi Gil-galad?
- perguntou Merry- Mas Passolargo não respondeu, e parecia estar perdido em pensamentos.
De repente, uma voz baixa murmurou:
Gil-galadfoi um Elfo-rei
que ao som das harpas cantarei: foi o último livre a reinar
entre essas Montanhas e o Mar.
Longa sua espada, a lança esguia, seu elmo ao longe resplandecia; milhões de estrelas lá
no céu refletiam-se em seu broquel.
Há muito tempo,foi-se embora, e ninguém sabe onde ele mora; sua estrela, na escuridão,
em Mordor onde as sombras vão.
Os outros se viraram surpresos, pois a voz era de Sam.
- Não pare! - disse Merry.
- É tudo o que sei - gaguejou Sam, corando. -Aprendi com o Sr. Bilbo, quando era menino.
Ele costumava me contar histórias como essa, sabendo que eu sempre estava
pronto para ouvir falar sobre elfos. Foi ele que me ensinou a ler. Era muito sabido
nessas coisas de livros, o velho e querido Sr. Bilbo. E ele escrevia poesia.
Escreveu o que acabei de recitar.
- Ele não escreveu isso - disse Passolargo. - o que você cantou é parte da balada que se
chama A Queda de Gil-galad, escrita numa língua antiga. Bilbo deve tê-la
traduzido. Eu não sabia disso.
- Havia mais um bom pedaço - disse Sam. - Tudo sobre Mordor. Eu não aprendi essa parte,
pois me dava calafrios. Nunca pensei que eu mesmo iria para lá!
#198
- Ir para Mordor! - gritou Pippin. - Espero que não cheguemos a isso!
- Não falem esse nome tão alto! - disse Passolargo.
Já era meio-dia quando se aproximaram da extremidade sul da trilha e viram adiante, na
pálida luz do céu de outubro, um barranco cinza-esverdeado, que subia a encosta
norte da colina como uma ponte. Decidiram ir para o topo imediatamente, enquanto a luz do
dia ainda era intensa. Não era mais possível se esconderem, e só podiam

esperar que nenhum espião ou inimigo os estivesse observando. Não se via nada em
movimento na colina. Se Gandalf estivesse nas redondezas, não dava sinais disso.
No flanco oeste do Topo do Vento encontraram uma reentrância coberta, em cuja parte
inferior havia um pequeno vale côncavo, com as encostas cobertas de capim. Ali
deixaram Sam e Pippin e o pônei e todas as mochilas e bagagens. Depois de meia hora de
escalada dificultosa, Passolargo atingiu a coroa da colina; Frodo e Merry
o seguiam, cansados e sem fôlego. A última subida era íngreme e pedregosa.
No topo encontraram, como Passolargo tinha dito, um grande círculo, de uma construção
antiga de pedra, agora ruindo, ou coberta pelo mato havia muito tempo. Mas
no centro um monte de pedras quebradas tinham sido empilhadas, fazendo lembrar uma
construção tumular. Estavam enegrecidas, como se pela ação do fogo. Em volta
dessas pedras, a turfa estava queimada até as raizes e em todo o interior do círculo o
mato estava chamuscado e murcho, como se chamas tivessem varrido o topo da
colina: mas não havia sinal de qualquer coisa viva.
Em pé, sobre a borda do círculo em ruínas, puderam ter uma boa visão de toda a região em
volta, pois a maior parte das terras era vazia e sem acidentes, com a exceção
de trechos de florestas distantes, na direção sul, além dos quais via-se, aqui e ali, o
brilho de águas distantes. Abaixo de Onde estavam, nesse lado sul, a Velha
Estrada se estendia como uma fita, vindo do oeste e descrevendo curvas que subiam e
desciam, até desaparecer atrás de uma serra escura no leste. Nada se movia nela.
Seguindo com os olhos a linha da Estrada em direção ao leste, viram as Montanhas: os
sopés mais próximos eram escuros e sombrios; atrás deles se erguiam formas cinzentas
mais altas, e atrás destas, por sua vez, ficavam altos picos brancos, luzindo contra as
nuvens.
- Bem, aqui estamos! - disse Merry. -A aparência do lugar
é triste e nem um
pouco convidativa! Não há água nem abrigo, E nem sinal de Gandalf Mas não
o culpo por não ter nos esperado - se é que passou por aqui.
-Também gostaria de saber- disse Passolargo, olhando em volta, pensativo. - Mesmo que ele
tivesse chegado a Bri um ou dois dias depois de nossa partida, poderia
ter chegado aqui primeiro. Ele pode cavalgar muito
#199
rápido quando há necessidade. - De repente se abaixou e olhou a pedra no topo da pilha;
era mais chata que as outras e mais branca, como se tivesse escapado do fogo.
Passolargo a apanhou e examinou, virando-a entre seus dedos. - Alguém tocou nesta pedra
recentemente - disse ele. O que acha destas marcas?
Na parte inferior da pedra, que era plana, Frodo viu alguns riscos:
- Parece um traço, um ponto, e mais três traços - disse ele.
- o traço à esquerda pode ser uma runa correspondente à letra G, com os ramos bem mais
finos - disse Passolargo. - Pode ser um sinal deixado por Gandalf, embora
seja impossível ter certeza. Os riscos são perfeitos e certamente parecem recentes. Mas
as marcas podem significar alguma coisa muito diferente e não ter nada a
ver conosco. Os Guardiões usam runas, e algumas vezes passam por aqui.
- O que poderiam significar, se Gandalf os tivesse feito? - perguntou Merry.
- Diria que representam G3 - respondeu Passolargo - e que significam que Gandalf esteve
aqui no dia 3 de outubro: quer dizer, há três
dias. Também podem
significar que ele estava com pressa e que havia perigo por perto, de modo que ele não
teve tempo ou não arriscou escrever nada mais longo ou direto. Se isto for
verdade, devemos tomar cuidado.
- Gostaria que pudéssemos ter certeza de que foi ele quem deixou as marcas, qualquer que
seja o significado delas - disse Frodo. - Seria um grande conforto saber
que ele está no caminho, na nossa frente ou atrás de nós.
- Talvez - disse Passolargo. - Tenho comigo que ele esteve aqui, e em perigo. Há marcas
de fogo aqui, e agora a luz que vimos há três noites no céu do leste volta
à minha mente. Acho que foi atacado no topo da colina, mas qual foi o resultado disso não
posso dizer. Ele não está mais aqui, e precisamos cuidar de nós mesmos

e fazer nosso caminho para Valfenda, da melhor maneira possível.
A que distância fica Valfenda? - perguntou Merry, olhando ao redor com cansaço.
O mundo era selvagem e grande, visto do Topo do Vento.
- Não sei se a Estrada já foi medida em milhas, além da Estalagem Abandonada, que fica a
um dia de viagem de Bri - respondeu Passolargo. Alguns dizem que a distância
é uma, outros dizem que é outra. É uma estrada estranha, e as pessoas se senten
infelizes quando chegam ao fim dela, não importa se o tempo de viagem for muito ou
pouco. Mas eu sei quanto eu demoraria indo sozinho, com tempo bom e sorte: doze dias
daqui até o Vau de Bruinen, onde a Estrada cruza o rio Ruidoságua,
que vem de Valfenda. Temos no mínimo quinze dias de viagem à frente, pois não acho que
poderemos usar a Estrada.
- Quinze dias! - disse Frodo. - Muita coisa pode acontecer nesse tempo.
#200
- Muita coisa - disse Passolargo.
Ficaram uns instantes quietos no topo da colina, perto de sua borda sul. Naquele lugar
solitário, Frodo percebeu, pela primeira vez de forma clara e completa, como
estava longe de casa e o perigo que corria. Teve um desejo amargo de que sua sorte o
tivesse deixado ficar no pacífico e amado Condado. Olhou para baixo, para a
estrada odiosa, que levava de volta para o Oeste - para o seu lar. De repente percebeu
que duas manchas negras se moviam lentamente ao longo dela, indo para o oeste,
e olhando de novo ele viu que outras três estavam se arrastando em direção ao leste,
vindo ao encontro das duas.
- Olhem - disse ele, apontando para baixo.
Imediatamente, Passolargo se jogou no chão atrás do círculo em ruínas, puxando Frodo
junto com ele. Merry se jogou do lado.
O que é? - cochichou ele.
Não sei, mas temo o pior - respondeu Passolargo.
Subiram devagar até a borda do círculo de novo, e espiaram através de uma fenda entre
duas pedras cortadas. A luz já não estava tão forte, pois a luminosidade matinal
tinha diminuído, e nuvens que vinham do leste haviam coberto o sol, que agora começava a
se pôr. Todos viram as manchas negras, mas nem Frodo nem Merry puderam adivinhar-lhes
o formato com certeza; mesmo assim, alguma coisa lhes dizia que lá, na distância, estavam
Cavaleiros Negros se encontrando na Estrada além do sopé da colina.
- Sim - disse Passolargo, que enxergava melhor e não tinha mais dúvidas. O Inimigo está aqui!
Rapidamente se arrastaram e escorregaram pelo lado norte da colina, para encontrar os
companheiros.
Sam e Peregrin não tinham ficado à toa. Exploraram o pequeno vale e as encostas à sua
volta. Não muito distante, encontraram uma fonte de água clara no
flanco da colina, e perto dela pegadas que não tinham mais que um ou dois dias. No
próprio valezinho, encontraram vestígios recentes de uma fogueira, e outros de
um acampamento
apressado. Havia algumas pedras caídas na borda do vale que ficava mais próxima da
colina. Atrás dessas pedras Sam encontrou um pequeno estoque de lenha cuidadosamente
empilhada.
- Pergunto-me se o velho Gandalf não passou por aqui - disse ele a Pippin. - Quem quer
que tenha colocado essas coisas aqui pretendia voltar, ao que parece.
Passolargo ficou muito interessado nessas descobertas. - Deveria ter esperado e explorado
eu mesmo o solo desta parte - disse ele, apressando-se em direção à fonte
para examinar as pegadas.
#201
É exatamente como eu temia - disse ele quando voltou. - Sam e Pippin pisaram na terra
fofa e as marcas estão adulteradas ou confusas. Guardiões passaram por aqui

recentemente. Foram eles que deixaram a lenha. Mas também existem várias pegadas mais
novas que não foram deixadas pelos Guardiões. Pelo menos, um conjunto delas
foi feito por botas pesadas, um ou dois dias atrás. Pelo menos um. Não Posso ter certeza
agora, mas acho que
muitos pés calçados com botas estiveram aqui. - Parou
quieto, numa reflexão ansiosa.
Cada um dos hobbits teve uma visão dos Cavaleiros, de capa e botas. Se essas criaturas já
tivessem encontrado o valezinho, quanto mais rápido Passolargo os levasse
para algum outro lugar, melhor. Sam olhava a reentrância com grande desagrado, agora que
tinha tido notícia dos inimigos na Estrada, apenas a algumas milhas dali.
- Não é melhor desocupar a área logo, Sr. Passolargo? - perguntou ele impaciente. - Está
ficando tarde e eu não gosto deste buraco: por algum motivo, aqui meu coração
fica pesado.
- Sim, certamente precisamos decidir o que fazer imediatamente respondeu Passolargo,
olhando para cima e considerando o tempo e o clima. - Bem, Sam - disse ele
finalmente -, também não gosto daqui, mas não consigo pensar em nenhum lugar
melhor que pudéssemos alcançar antes do cair da noite. Pelo menos aqui estamos escondidos
por enquanto, e se sairmos é muito mais provável que sejamos vistos por espiões. A única
coisa possível seria sair de nosso caminho, de volta para o norte deste
lado das colinas, onde o terreno é muito parecido com o daqui. A Estrada está sendo
vigiada, e poderíamos ter de cruzá-la, se tentássemos nos esconder nas moitas
do lado sul. Do lado norte da Estrada, além das colinas, o terreno é descampado e plano
por várias milhas.
- Os Cavaleiros podem enxergar? - perguntou Merry. - Quero dizer, eles parecem geralmente
ter usado mais os narizes que os olhos, farejando-nos, se farejando é a
palavra correta, pelo menos à luz do dia. Mas você nos obrigou a deitar no chão quando os
viu lá embaixo, e agora fala em sermos vistos, caso saiamos daqui.
- Fui muito descuidado no topo da colina - respondeu Passolargo. - Estava muito ansioso
por encontrar algum sinal de Gandalf, mas foi um erro nós três ficarmos lá
em cima tanto tempo. Pois os cavalos negros podem ver, e os Cavaleiros podem usar homens
e outras criaturas como espiões, como vimos lá em Bri. Eles próprios não
conseguem enxergar o mundo da luz como nós, mas nossas formas lançam sombras em suas
mentes, que apenas o sol do meio-dia pode destruir; e no escuro eles percebem
muitos sinais e formas que ficam escondidos de nós: nessas ocasiões é que devemos receálos mais. E a qualquer hora, sentem o cheiro do sangue de criaturas
#202
vivas, desejando-o e odiando-o. Sentidos também, existem outros além da visão e do
olfato. Podemos sentir a presença deles - preocupa nossos corações desde que
chegamos aqui, e antes que os víssemos; eles sentem a nossa presença de forma mais aguda.
Além disso - acrescentou ele, e nesse momento sua voz se reduziu a um sussurro
-, o Anel os atrai.
- Então não há saída - disse Frodo, olhando à sua volta furioso. - Se sair daqui, serei
visto e caçado! Se ficar, vou atraí-los para mim! Passolargo colocou a mão
no ombro dele. - Ainda há esperança - disse
ele. - Você não está sozinho. Vamos considerar como um sinal esta lenha que está colocada
aqui, pronta para uma fogueira. Aqui não há muito abrigo ou defesa, mas
o fogo deverá servir como ambos. Sauron pode usar o fogo em seus desígnios maléficos,
como pode usar todas as coisas, mas esSes Cavaleiros não apreciam muito o fogo,
e temem os que se defendem com ele. O fogo é nosso amigo em lugares ermos.
Pode ser - murmurou Sam. - Também não consigo pensar numa maneira melhor de dizer "ei,
estamos aqui!", sem gritar. Aliás, acho que é a mesma coisa.
No canto mais baixo e mais bem protegido do valezinho, acenderam uma fogueira, e
prepararam uma refeição. As sombras da noite começaram a cair, e ficou mais frio.
De repente perceberam que estavam com muita fome, pois não tinham comido nada desde o
desjejum; mesmo assim não ousaram fazer mais que uma ceia frugal. As regiões
à frente eram vazias, a não ser por pássaros e animais, lugares inóspitos abandonados por
todas as raças do mundo. Às vezes Guardiões passavam além das colinas,

mas eram poucos e não ficavam. Outros viajantes eram raros, e tinham propósitos maldosos:
trolls poderiam vir de vez em quando dos vales ao norte das Montanhas Sombrias.
Somente na Estrada era possível encontrar viajantes, em sua maioria anões, correndo atrás
de seus próprios negócios, sem ajuda ou palavra para oferecer a estranhos.
- Não posso pensar num modo de fazer nossa comida durar - disse Frodo. - Fomos cautelosos
o bastante nos últimos dias, e esta ceia não é nenhum banquete. Mesmo assim
usamos mais do que deveríamos, se ainda temos duas semanas à frente, talvez mais ainda.
- Há comida na floresta - disse Passolargo - amoras, raizes e ervas, e tenho alguma
habilidade como caçador se for necessário. Não precisam ter medo de passar fome
antes de o inverno chegar. Mas colher e apanhar comida é um trabalho longo e cansativo, e
precisamos nos apressar. Por isso, apertem os cintos e pensem com esperança
nas mesas da casa de Elrond!
O frio aumentou com o cair da noite. Olhando da borda do valezinho eles não conseguiam
enxergar nada, a não ser um terreno cinzento que
agora
#203
desaparecia rapidamente na sombra. o céu ficou limpo de novo e lentamente se encheu de
estrelas piscando. Frodo e seus companheiros se aconchegaram em volta do
fogo, embrulhados em todas as roupas e cobertores que tinham; mas Passolargo parecia
satisfeito com uma única capa, e se sentou um pouco separado, fumando seu cachimbo,
pensativo.
À medida que a noite caía e o fogo brilhava mais forte, ele começou a contar-lhes
histórias para afugentar o medo de seus corações. Sabia muitas histórias e lendas
de antigamente, de elfos e homens e dos feitos bons e malignos dos Dias Antigos. Os
hobbits ficaram imaginando qual seria a idade dele, e onde ele tinha aprendido
toda aquela tradição.
- Conte-nos sobre Gil-galad - disse Merry de repente, quando Passolargo fez uma pausa ao
fim de uma história sobre os Reinados Élficos. Você sabe mais algum pedaço
daquela balada da qual falou?
- Sei sim - respondeu Passolargo. - E Frodo também sabe, pois ela nos diz respeito. Merry e Pippin olharam para Frodo que dirigia seu olhar para o fogo.
- Só sei o pouco que Gandalf me contou - disse Frodo devagar. - Gil-galad foi o último
dos Reis-elfos da Terra-média. Gil-galad quer dizer Luz nas Estrelas na língua
deles. Junto com Elendil, o Amigo-dos-elfos, ele foi para a terra de...
- Não! - disse Passolargo. - Não acho que a história deva ser contada agora, com os
servidores do Inimigo por perto. Se conseguirmos chegar à casa de Elrond, poderão
ouvir ali a história inteira.
- Então nos conte alguma outra história de anti
gamente - pediu Sam.
- Uma história sobre os elfos antes que começassem a desaparecer. Gostaria muito de
escutar mais sobre os elfos; a escuridão está caindo sobre nós com tanta força...
- Vou contar-lhes a história de Tinúviel - disse Passolargo. - Resumida, pois essa é uma
longa história da qual não se sabe o fim; e ninguém atualmente, com exceção
de Elrond, pode lembrá-la exatamente como era contada há tempos. É uma bela história,
embora triste, como todas as histórias da Terra-média; mesmo assim ela pode
animar seus corações. - Então ele começou, não a falar, mas a cantar suavemente:
Asfolhas longas, verde a grama, Esguia é da cicuta a umbela; No prado há luz que se
derrama
De um céu de estrelas a,fulgir, Tinúviel dançando bela,
Ao som queflauta oculta inflama; Há estrelas nos cabelos dela
#204

E no seu manto a reluzir
E Beren vem dos montes frios,

Perdido esteve entre a ramagem,
Seguindo o som de élficos rios,
Andou sozinho em seu sofrer
Por entre as falhas da folhagem
Vê flores de ouro de atavios
Que ela traz sobre a roupagem
E no cabelo há anoitecer
Seus pés curados por magia
De seu cansaço da jornada;
E forte e lépido seguia
Pegando raios de luar
E leve em fuga baila afada
Por bosques, de elfos moradia;
De novo só na caminhada,
Ele em silêncio a espreitar
Ouvia o som da fugitiva
Com pés de tília por leveza; Do chão saía música viva,
Do chão saía música viva,
De valos fundos um trilar
Já a cicuta perde a beleza
E uma a uma pensativas
Da faia as folhas com tristeza
No chão do inverno vão rolar
Seguindo sempre, longe andou, Dos anos folhas viu caindo;
Com lua e estrela ele avançou, O céu gelado viu bramir
O manto dela á luz luzindo, Quando num topo ela parou
Dançando e assim com seu pé lindo Névoa de prata frzfremir
Nofim do inverno ela retorna, Sua voz desata a primavera
Qual cotovia ou chuva morna, Qual água nova a borbulhar

Viu ele flores de elfos e era
O pé da ninfa; em nova forma, Com ela quis dançar quisera Por sobre a grama namorar
Mas ela vai, quando ele vem. Tinúviel! Tinúviel!
Com o nome dela ele a detém, Pois ela pára para ouvir
A voz prende Tinúviel, Beren avança, Beren vem, Sobre ela a sina então desceu!
Nos braços dele vai cair.
Seus olhosfitam seu olhar
Por entre a sombra dos cabelos; A luz que treme do luar
Viu dentro dela reluzir Tinúviel detém apelos, Imortal fiada de encantar;
Envolve o amor com seus cabelos E braços brancos de luzir
Foi longa a estrada de sua sorte,
Por pedras, frio e meia-luz;
Em férreos halís comporta forte,
Em mata escura e sem aurora.
O Mar que afasta se introduz,
Mais uma vez sorri a sorte
Na mata canta o par, só luz,
Que há muitos anosfoi-se embora.
Passolargo suspirou e fez uma pausa, antes de começar a falar de novo. - Essa é uma
canção - disse ele - no estilo chamado

annthennath entre os elfos, mas é dificil
reproduzi-la na Língua Geral, e o que cantei é apenas um eco rude dela. Fala sobre o
encontro de Beren, filho de Barahir, e Lúthien Tinúviel. Beren era um homem
mortal, mas Lúthien era a filha de Thingol, um Rei Élfico da Terra-média na época em que
o mundo era jovem. Ela era a mais bonita entre todas as donzelas daquele
mundo. Sua graciosidade se comparava à das estrelas sobre a névoa das terras do Norte, e
em seu rosto brilhava uma luz. Naqueles dias, o Grande Inimigo, de quem
#206
Sauron de Mordor era apenas um servidor, morava em Angband no Norte, e os elfos do Oeste,
voltando à Terra-média, guerrearam contra ele para reaver as Silmarils
que ele havia roubado, e os pais dos homens ajudaram os elfos. Mas o Inimigo foi
vitorioso e Barahir foi assassinado. Beren, escapando de grandes perigos, veio pelas
Montanhas do Terror e chegou até o escondido Reino de Thingol na floresta de Neldoreth.
Ali viu Lúthien, cantando e dançando numa clareira ao lado do rio encantado
Esgalduin; ele a chamou de Tinúviel, que quer dizer Rouxinol na língua antiga. Muitas
coisas tristes aconteceram a eles depois disso, e ficaram separados por muito
tempo. Tinúviel resgatou Beren dos calabouços de Sauron e juntos eles passaram por
grandes perigos, até mesmo destronando o Grande Inimigo e pegando de sua coroa
de ferro uma das três Silmarils, as mais brilhantes das jóias, para usá-la como dote de
Lúthien a ser pago a seu pai, Thingol. Mas no fim Beren foi assassinado pelo
Lobo que veio dos portões de Angband, e morreu nos braços de Tinúviel. Mas ela escolheu a
mortalidade, aceitando desaparecer do mundo, para poder segui-lo; conta-se
que eles se encontraram de novo além dos Mares Divisores, e depois de andarem juntos e
vivos outra vez nas florestas verdes, por um curto período, juntos passaram,
há muito tempo, para além dos confins deste mundo. Desse modo, Lúthien Tinúviel foi a
única, de todo o povo Élfico, a realmente morrer e deixar o mundo, e eles perderam
a que mais amavam. Mas, a partir dela, a linhagem dos Elfos-senhores de antigamente teve
uma descendência entre os homens. Ainda vivem aqueles de quem Lúthien foi
ancestral, e afirma-se que essa linhagem nunca vai terminar. Elrond de Valferida faz
parte dela. Pois de Beren e Lúthien nasceu o herdeiro de Dior Thingol, e dele
nasceu Elwing, a Branca, que se casou com
Eärendil, aquele que conduziu seu navio das névoas do mundo para dentro dos mares do céu
com a
Silmaril em sua testa. E
de Eärendil nasceram os Reis de Númenor, quer dizer, de Ponente.
Conforme Passolargo ia falando, os hobbits observavam seu rosto estranho e intenso, pouco
iluminado pelo brilho vermelho do fogo. Os olhos brilhavam e a voz era
cheia e profunda. Sobre ele, um céu negro e estrelado. De repente, uma luz pálida
apareceu sobre a coroa do Topo do Vento atrás dele. A lua crescente subia lentamente
sobre a colina que projetava sua sombra sobre eles, e as estrelas acima do topo da colina
desapareceram.
A história terminou. Os hobbits se mexeram e espreguiçaram. - Olhem!
- disse Merry. - A Lua está subindo: deve estar ficando tarde.
Os outros olharam para cima. No mesmo momento em que fizeram isso, viram no topo da
colina algo pequeno e escuro contra o brilho do luar. Talvez fosse apenas uma
pedra grande, ou alguma rocha saliente evidenciada pela luz fraca.
Sam e Merry se levantaram e andaram para longe do fogo. Frodo e Pippin permaneceram
sentados em silêncio. Passolargo estava observando
#207
atentamente o luar sobre o topo da colina. Tudo parecia silencioso e quieto,
mas Frodo sentiu um terror gelado tomando conta de seu coração, e agora Passolargo
não falava mais. Aconchegou-se mais perto do fogo. Nesse monento Sam veio correndo da
borda do valezinho.

- Não sei o que é - disse ele mas de repente senti medo, Não saio deste vale por nenhum
dinheiro do mundo; senti que alguma coisa estava subindo a encosta.
- Você viu alguma coisa? - perguntou Frodo, ficando de pé.
- Não, senhor. Não vi nada, mas não parei para olhar.
- Eu vi algo - disse Merry. - Ou pensei que vi - lá adiante, do lado oeste, onde o luar
estava caindo sobre as planícies além da sombra dos topos das colinas. Pensei
ter visto duas ou três formas negras. Pareciam se mover para cá.
- Fiquem perto do fogo, com seus rostos virados para fora! - gritou Passolargo. - Peguem
alguns dos paus mais longos e fiquem prontos para atacar.
Por um período em que nem respiraram ficaram ali sentados, em silêncio e alerta, com as
costas voltadas para a fogueira, cada um olhando as sombras que os envolviam.
Nada aconteceu.
Não havia som ou movimento na noite. Frodo se mexeu, sentindo que
deveria quebrar o silêncio: queria gritar bem alto.
- psssiu! - sussurrou Passolargo. - O que é aquilo? - disse Merry no mesmo momento, todo
assustado.
Sobre a saliência do pequeno vale, do lado oposto ao da colina, sentiram, mais
propriamente do que viram, uma sombra se levantar, uma sombra ou mais de uma. Forçaram
os olhos, e as sombras pareciam crescer. Logo não havia mais dúvida: três ou quatro
figuras negras e altas estavam ali, na encosta, olhando para baixo em direção
a eles: tão escuras eram que pareciam buracos negros na escuridão que os envolvia. Frodo
pensou ter ouvido um chiado fraco, como um sopro venenoso, e sentiu um frio
fino e cortante. Depois as figuras avançaram lentamente.
Pippin e Merry, tomados de terror, jogaram-se no chão. Sam se encolheu ao lado de Frodo.
Frodo estava quase tão apavorado quanto seus companheiros; tremia como se
sentisse um frio intenso, mas seu medo foi engolido por uma tentação repentina de colocar
o Anel.
O desejo de fazer isso mais nada. Não tomou conta de sua mente, que não lhe permitia
pensar em
esquecera o Túmulo, nem a mensagem de Gandalf-, mas alguma coisa parecia forçá-lo a
desconsiderar todas as advertências, e ele desejava ceder. Não com a esperança
de escapar, ou de fazer qualquer coisa, boa ou má: simplesmente sentia que deveria pegar
o Anel e colocá-lo no dedo. Não podia falar. Sentia que Sam o olhava, como
se soubesse que seu patrão estava com
#208
algum problema bem grande, mas Frodo não conseguia olhar na direção dele. Fechou os olhos
e lutou por uns minutos, mas a resistência se tornou insuportável, e finalmente
tirou a corrente devagar e colocou o Anel no dedo indicador da mão esquerda.
Imediatamente, embora tudo continuasse como antes, escuro e sombrio, as figuras se
tornaram terrivelmente claras. Frodo podia ver através de suas roupas pretas. Havia
cinco figuras altas: duas em pé, na saliência do valezinho, três avançando. Nos seus
rostos brancos brilhavam olhos agudos e impiedosos; sob as capas havia grandes
túnicas cinzentas; sobre os cabelos cinzentos, elmos de prata; nas mãos magras, espadas
de aço. Seus olhos caíram sobre ele e o penetraram enquanto corriam na sua
direção. Desesperado, Frodo puxou sua espada, tendo a impressão de que dela emanava um
brilho vermelho,
como se estivesse em brasa. Duas das figuras pararam. A
terceira era maior que as outras: o cabelo era longo e brilhante, e sobre seu elmo estava
uma coroa. Numa mão segurava uma longa espada, e na outra uma faca; tanto
a faca quanto a mão que a segurava brilhavam com uma luz fraca. Ele pulou para frente e
avançou sobre Frodo.
Naquele instante, Frodo se jogou para frente em direção ao chão, e ouviu sua própria voz
gritando alto: ó Elbereth! Gilthoniel! Ao mesmo tempo, golpeou os pés do
inimigo. Um grito agudo cortou a noite, e ele sentiu uma dor, como se um dardo envenenado
tivesse penetrado seu ombro esquerdo. Ao desmaiar viu de relance, como
se por entre um turbilhão de névoa, Passolargo saltando da escuridão com um pedaço de
lenha em chamas em cada mão. Num último esforço, deixando cair a espada, Frodo

tirou o Anel do dedo e o apertou na mão direita.

#209
CAPíTULO XII
FUGA PARA O VAU

Quando Frodo voltou a si, ainda apertava o Anel desesperadamente na mão. Estava deitado
perto da fogueira, que agora estava alta e produzia
uma chama forte. Os
três companheiros se debruçavam sobre ele.
- O que aconteceu? Onde está o rei pálido? - perguntou ele ansiosamente.
Os amigos, ao ouvi-lo falar, por alguns momentos ficaram tão enlevados que não
conseguiram responder, nem tampouco entenderam a
pergUnta. Finalmente Frodo soube
através de Sam que eles não tinham visto nada além das formas sombrias vindo na direção
deles. De repente, para seu pavor, Sam descobrira que seu patrão tinha desaparecido;
naquele momento, a figura negra passou correndo por ele, que caiu. Sam escutara a voz de
Frodo, mas parecera-lhe que ela vinha de um Ponto muito distante, ou de
baixo da terra, gritando palavras estranhas. Nenhum deles pôde ver mais nada, até que
tropeçaram no corpo de Frodo, que parecia morto, com o rosto virado no capim
e caído sobre a espada. Passolargo ordenou que o carregassem até perto do fogo, e depois
desapareceu. isso já fazia algum tempo.
Sam estava ficando visivelmente desconfiado de Passolargo outra vez; enquanto conversavam
ele voltou, surgindo de repente das sombras. Assustaram-se, e Sam, empunhando
a espada, ficou de pé, protegendo Frodo; mas Passolargo se ajoelhou rapidamente ao lado
dele.
- Não sou nenhum Cavaleiro Negro, Sam - disse ele suavemente. Nem sou aliado deles.
Estive tentando descobrir alguma coisa através de seus movimentos, mas não percebi
nada. Não consigo entender por que foram embora, e por que não atacam de novo. Mas não
senti a presença deles em nenhum ponto aqui por perto.
Passolargo ficou muito preocupaAo escutar o que Frodo tinha a dizer,
balançou a cabeça e suspirou. Então pediu a Pippin e Merry que aquecessem a maior
quantidade possível de água em suas pequenas chaleiras, e que banhassem o ferimento
de Frodo. - mantenham o fogo bem forte, e mantenham Frodo aquecido! - disse ele. Depois
se levantou e se afastou, chamando Sam. -Acho que posso entender melhor as
coisas agora - disse ele em voz baixa. - Parece que só havia cinco inimigos. Por que não
estavam todos aqui, não sei; mas não acho que esperavam encontrar resistência.
Retiraram-se por enquanto. Mas receio que não estejam longe. Voltarão quando chegar outra
noite, se não conseguirmos escapar. Estão apenas

porque acham que seu propósito está quase realizado, e que o Anel não pode ir muito mais
longe. Receio, Sam, que acreditam que seu patrão tem um ferimento mortal,
que fará com que se submeta à vontade deles. Veremos!
Sam sufocou as lágrimas.
- Não se desespere! - disse Passolargo. Agora deve confiar em mim.
O seu Frodo é feito de uma fibra mais resistente do que eu havia imaginado,
embora Gandalf tivesse me prevenido disso. Ele não foi assassinado, e acho que resistirá
ao poder maligno do ferimento por mais tempo do que o inimigo espera. Farei
o que estiver ao meu alcance para ajudá-lo e curá-lo. Protejam-no bem enquanto eu estiver
fora!

- Saiu apressado e desapareceu de novo na escuridão.
Frodo cochilava, embora a dor causada pelo ferimento crescesse lentamente, e um frio
mortal começasse a se espalhar pelo seu corpo, partindo do ombro e atingindo
o braço e o flanco. Os amigos cuidavam dele, aquecendo-lhe o corpo e banhando o
ferimento. A noite passou, lenta e cansativa. A aurora começava a crescer no céu,
e o valezinho se enchia de uma luz cinzenta, quando Passolargo finalmente retornou.
- Olhem! - gritou ele, abaixando-se e pegando do chão uma capa preta que tinha ficado
ali, escondida pela escuridão. Cerca de trinta centímetros acima da bainha
inferior havia um rasgo. - Isto foi o golpe da espada de Frodo - disse ele. - Receio que
tenha sido o único ferimento que fez no inimigo; pois não está danificada,
mas todas as espadas que perfuram esse terrível Rei são destruídas. Mais terrível para
ele foi ouvir o nome de
Elbereth.
E mais fatal para Frodo foi isto! - Abaixou-se de novo e levantou uma faca comprida e
fina, que emitia um brilho frio. Conforme Passolargo a ergueu, eles viram que
a lâmina estava chanfrada perto da extremidade, e que a ponta estava quebrada. Mas nesse
mesmo momento, enquanto a faca era erguida perante a luz crescente, eles
observaram atônitos: a lâmina pareceu derreter, e sumiu como fumaça no ar, deixando
apenas o cabo na mão de Passolargo. - Infelizmente - disse ele - foi essa maldita
faca que causou o ferimento em Frodo. Atualmente, poucos têm o poder de cura capaz de
fazer frente a armas tão malignas. Mas farei o que puder.
Sentou-se no chão, e tomando o cabo do punhal, colocou-o sobre os joelhos, e cantou uma
canção lenta, numa língua estranha. Depois, pondo-o de lado, voltou-se para
Frodo e, num tom suave, pronunciou palavras que os outros não conseguiram entender. Da
bolsa acoplada ao seu cinto, retirou as folhas longas de uma planta.
- Essas folhas - disse ele -, caminhei muito para encontrá-las, pois esta planta não
nasce nas colinas sem vegetação. Mas nas moitas que ficam lá adiante, ao sul
da Estrada, consegui encontrá-la pelo cheiro das folhas. Esmagou uma folha nos dedos, e
ela emanou uma fragrância doce e pungente. - Foi sorte tê-la encontrado,
pois esta é uma planta medicinal que os
#211
homens do Oeste trouxeram para a Terra-média. Athelas é o nome que lhe davam, e
atualmente alguns pés crescem esparsos, perto dos lugares onde eles moraram ou
acamparam antigamente. A planta não é conhecida no Norte, a não ser por alguns daqueles
que vagam pelas Terras Ermas. Tem grandes poderes, mas sobre um ferimento
como esse sua eficácia pode ser pequena.
jogou as folhas na água fervente e banhou o ombro de Frodo. A fragrância do vapor era
reconfortante, e os que não estavam feridos sentiram suas mentes acalmadas
e lúcidas. A erva também teve certo poder sobre o ferimento, pois Frodo sentiu que a dor
e também a sensação de frio cediam;
mas a vida não voltou ao seu braço,
e ele não podia movê-lo ou levantar a mão. Arrependia-se amargamente de sua tolice,
reprovando sua pouca determinação. Agora percebia que, tendo colocado o Anel,
havia obedecido não apenas ao seu próprio desejo, mas também à vontade imperativa dos
inimigos.
Perguntava-se se ficaria mutilado para o resto da vida, e como conseguiriam
prosseguir a viagem agora. Sentia-se fraco demais para ficar em pé.
Os outros estavam discutindo justamente essa questão. Logo decidiram deixar o Topo do
Vento o mais rápido possível. - Agora acho - disse Passolargo - que o Inimigo
esteve vigiando este lugar já por alguns dias. Se Gandalf passou por aqui, foi forçado a
ir embora, e não voltará mais. De qualquer forma, corremos grande perigo
depois do escurecer, desde o ataque da noite passada, e dificilmente encontraremos um
perigo maior, onde quer que estejamos.
Logo que o dia raiou por completo, comeram algo rapidamente
e embalaram a
bagagem. Para Frodo era impossível caminhar; então eles dividiram a maior parte

da bagagem entre os quatro, colocando-o montado no pônei. Nos últimos dias, o pobre
animal tinha melhorado, de forma inesperada; já parecia mais gordo e forte, e
tinha começado a demonstrar afeição pelos novos donos, especialmente por Sam. o
tratamento de Bill Samambaia devia ter sido muito duro, para que a viagem por esse
lugar deserto lhe parecesse tão melhor que sua vida anterior.
Partiram em direção ao sul. Isso significaria atravessar a Estrada, mas era o caminho
mais curto até a região mais arborizada. E eles precisavam de lenha. Passolargo
tinha recomendado que Frodo fosse mantido aquecido, especialmente à noite, e além disso o
fogo representaria alguma proteção
para todos eles. Diminuir o trajeto cortando caminho, atalhando
uma outra grande volta da Estrada, também estava nos planos dele: a leste do Topo do
Vento a Estrada mudava de rumo e fazia uma grande curva para o norte.
Prosseguiram lenta e cuidadosamente, contornando a encosta sul da
colina, e em pouco tempo estavam na borda da Estrada. Não havia sinal dos
#212
Cavaleiros. Mas no momento em que a atravessaram correndo, escutaram dois gritos: uma voz
fria chamando, e uma voz fria respondendo. Tremendo, jogaram-se para frente,
dirigindo-se para as moitas que ficavam adiante. A região à frente descia em direção ao
sul, mas era deserta e sem trilhas: arbustos e árvores raquíticas cresciam
em trechos densos, com grandes espaços vazios entre eles. O capim era ralo, áspero e
cinzento; as folhas nas moitas estavam amareladas e caindo. Era uma região triste,
e a viagem era lenta e melancólica. Falavam pouco enquanto avançavam. O coração de Frodo
estava penalizado ao ver os outros andando ao seu lado, cabisbaixos, com
as costas curvadas sob o peso da bagagem. Até mesmo Passolargo parecia cansado e triste.
Antes que o primeiro dia de viagem terminasse, a dor de Frodo começou a aumentar de novo,
mas ele não mencionou o fato por um bom tempo. Quatro dias se passaram,
sem que o chão ou a paisagem mudassem de modo significativo, a não ser pelo Topo do
Vento, que sumia lentamente atrás deles, e pelas montanhas distantes, que ficavam
um pouco mais próximas. Mas, desde aquele grito distante, não tinham visto ou ouvido
sinais de que o inimigo estivesse vigiando ou seguindo seus passos. As horas
escuras eram as mais temidas, e eles montavam guarda, revezando pares durante a noite,
esperando ver, a qualquer momento, figuras negras surgindo na noite cinzenta,
mal iluminada pela lua velada de nuvens. Apesar disso, nada viram, nada escutaram, exceto
o suspiro das folhas esbranquiçadas e do capim. Nenhuma vez sentiram a
presença maligna que os tinha rondado antes do ataque no valezinho. Parecia bom demais
esperar que os Cavaleiros já tivessem perdido sua trilha. Quem sabe se não
estavam esperando, preparando alguma emboscada, nalguma passagem estreita?
Ao final do quinto dia, o solo começou de novo a subir, lentamente, saindo do vasto e
raso vale no qual tinham descido. Passolargo agora mudara o curso outra vez,
dirigindo-se para o nordeste, e no fim do sexto dia tinham chegado ao topo de uma ladeira
de subida dificil, vendo à frente um amontoado de colinas cobertas por
florestas; à direita, um rio cinzento brilhava pálido na fraca luz do sol. Na distância,
entretanto, vislumbravam um outro rio, num vale pedregoso, meio velado pela
névoa.
- Receio que devemos voltar para a Estrada neste ponto, e continuar nela por mais um
trecho - disse Passolargo. - Chegamos ao rio Fontegris, que os elfos chamam
de Mitheithel. Ele corre da Charneca Etten, os morros dos trolls ao norte de Valfenda, e
se junta ao Ruidoságua mais para o Sul. Alguns o chamam de rio Cinzento
depois desse ponto. É um grande volume de água, no trecho anterior ao seu encontro com o
Mar. Não há como atravessá-lo abaixo de suas cabeceiras na Charneca Etten,
a não ser utilizando a última Ponte, pela qual a Estrada atravessa.
#213
- O que é aquele outro rio que estamos vendo lá adiante? - perguntou MerryOs direitos sobre essa obra são protegidos pelas leis internacionais de Copyright. Não pode ser vendido, imprimido nem

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
- Aquele é o Ruidoságua, o Bruinen de Valfenda - respondeu Passolargo. - A Estrada vai
acompanhando a borda das colinas por muitas
milhas, desde a Ponte até o Vau
do Bruinen. Mas ainda não pensei em como o atravessaremos. Um rio de cada vez! Teremos
sorte se não encontrarmos a última Ponte tomada pelo inimigo.
No dia seguinte pela manhã, atingiram de novo a beira da Estrada. Sam e Passolargo foram
na frente, mas não havia sinal de viajantes ou cavaleiros. Naquele ponto,
sob a sombra das colinas, tinha chovido. Passolargo julgou que a chuva tinha caído dois
dias antes, e que tinha apagado as pegadas. Nenhum cavaleiro tinha passado
por ali desde então, pelo que podia ver.
Apressaram-se pela Estrada o mais rápido que conseguiram e, depois de uma ou duas milhas,
depararam com a última Ponte, na base de uma ladeira curta e íngreme. Tinham
receado encontrar figuras negras esperando ali, mas não viram nenhuma. Passolargo fez com
que eles se abrigassem numa moita ao lado da Estrada, enquanto foi na frente
explorar a região.
Logo ele voltou correndo. - Não vejo sinal do inimigo - disse ele. E gostaria muito de
saber o que isso significa. Mas encontrei algo muito estranho.
Estendeu a mão, mostrando uma pedra singular, de um verde-claro. Encontrei-a na lama, no
meio da Ponte - disse ele. - É um berilo, uma pedra élfica. Se foi colocada
lá, ou se caiu por acaso, não posso dizer; mas me traz esperança. Tomarei a pedra como um
sinal de que podemos atravessar a Ponte; mas depois dela não devemos nos
arriscar a continuar na Estrada, sem algum outro sinal mais evidente.
Mais uma vez prosseguiram. Atravessaram a Ponte a salvo, não escutando nenhum ruído, a
não ser o da água em torvelinho contra seus três grandes arcos. Uma milha
mais adiante encontraram um desfiladeiro estreito que conduzia para o norte, através das
terras íngremes à esquerda da Estrada. Neste ponto, Passolargo deixou a
Estrada, e logo estavam todos perdidos num lugar sombrio, de árvores escuras distribuídas
entre os pés de colinas taciturnas.
Os hobbits ficaram contentes por deixar a região melancólica e a perigosa Estrada para
trás, mas esse novo trecho parecia hostil e ameaçador. Conforme avançavam,
as colinas à frente ficavam cada vez mais altas. Aqui e ali, sobre topos e cordilheiras,
podiam ver os restos de antigas muralhas de pedra, e ruínas de torres: tinham
uma aparência agourenta. Frodo, que não estava andando, tinha tempo para olhar à frente e
pensar. Lembrava-se
#214
do relato que Bilbo fizera de sua viagem, e das torres ameaçadoras sobre as colinas ao
norte da Estrada, na região próxima à floresta dos trolls, onde sua primeira
aventura séria tinha ocorrido. Frodo supunha estar agora na mesma região, e imaginava se
por acaso passariam pelo mesmo ponto.
- Quem mora por aqui? - perguntou ele. - E quem construiu essas torres? Essa região
pertence aos trolls?
- Não - disse Passolargo. - Os trolls não constroem nada. Ninguém mora aqui. Os homens
moraram numa certa época, eras atrás; mas ninguém permanece agora.
Tornaram-se
um povo mau, dizem as lendas, pois foram dominados pela sombra de Anginar. Mas todos
foram destruidos na guerra que exterminou o Reino do Norte. Mas tudo isso faz
muito tempo, e as colinas os esqueceram, embora uma sombra ainda cubra a região.
- Onde você aprendeu essas histórias, se toda a região está vazia e esquecida? perguntou Peregrin. - Aves e animais não contam histórias desse tipo.
- Os herdeiros de Elendil não esquecem todas as coisas passadas disse Passolargo. - E
muitas outras coisas que posso contar são relembradas em Valfenda.
- Você esteve muitas vezes em Valfenda? - perguntou Frodo.
- Estive - disse Passolargo. - Morei lá uma época, e ainda volto quando posso. Ali está
meu coração; mas meu destino não é me acomodar em paz, mesmo na bela casa
de Elrond.

As colinas agora começavam a enclausurá-los. Atrás, a Estrada continuava seu caminho em
direção ao rio Bruinen, mas ambos agora estavam escondidos. Os viajantes
chegaram a um vale comprido; estreito, profundo, escuro e silencioso. Árvores com raizes
velhas e retorcidas se debruçavam sobre abismos, e se amontoavam em ladeiras
íngremes cobertas de pinheiros.
Os hobbits ficaram muito cansados. Avançavam devagar, pois tinham de fazer seu caminho em
meio a uma região sem trilhas, cheia de árvores e rochas caídas. Evitavam
ao máximo escalar as encostas, por causa de Frodo, e também porque era realmente dificil
achar algum caminho que os tirasse dos vales estreitos. Já estavam havia
dois dias nessa região quando o clima se tornou úmido. O vento começou a soprar
continuamente do oeste, derramando a água dos mares distantes sobre as cabeças pretas
das colinas, na forma de uma chuva fina que alagava tudo. Ao cair da noite estavam todos
ensopados, e o acampamento que fizeram não tinha conforto, pois não conseguiram
acender fogueira alguma. No dia seguinte, as colinas à frente ficaram ainda mais altas e
íngremes, o que os forçou a mudar de rumo, indo para o norte. Passolargo
parecia estar ficando ansioso: já estavam a quase dez dias do Topo do Vento, e a reserva
de provisões estava começando a ficar escassa. Continuava a chover.
#215
Naquela noite, acamparam numa saliência rochosa com uma muralha de pedra atrás deles, na
qual havia uma caverna não muito profunda, uma simples concavidade na encosta.
Frodo estava inquieto. O frio e a umidade faziam com que seu ferimento doesse mais que
nunca, e a dor e o sentimento de frio mortal impediam que dormisse- Ficava
deitado, virando-se de um lado para o outro e escutando, cheio de terror, os furtivos
ruídos da noite: vento nas fendas das rochas, água gotejando, um estalo, a
queda repentina e estrepitosa de uma rocha desprendida. Sentiu que figuras negras se
aproximavam para sufocá-lo, mas, quando se sentou, não viu nada além das costas
de Passolargo, sentado e arqueado para frente, fumando seu cachimbo, vigiando. Deitou-se
de novo e entrou num sonho agitado, no qual ele caminhava sobre a grama
de seu jardim no Condado, mas a imagem parecia apagada e fraca, menos nítida que as
sombras altas e negras que olhavam sobre a cerca-viva.
De manhã, acordou e viu que a chuva tinha parado. As nuvens ainda estavam densas, mas iam
se desfazendo, e pálidas faixas azuis apareciam por entre elas.
O vento
estava mudando de novo. Não partiram cedo. Imediatamente após um desjejum frio e pouco
reconfortante, Passolargo saiu sozinho, dizendo aos outros que ficassem sob
o abrigo da encosta até que ele voltasse. Ia escalar, se pudesse, para dar uma olhada na
configuração do terreno.
Quando voltou, não estava confiante. - Desviamos demais para o norte
- disse ele. - E temos de achar um caminho para voltar outra vez em direção ao sul. Se
continuarmos por onde estamos indo, acabaremos chegando nos Vales Etten, muito
ao norte de Valfenda. Ali é região de trolls, que eu conheço pouco. Talvez pudéssemos
achar um caminho e chegar a Valfenda pelo norte, mas isso levaria muito tempo,
pois não sei o caminho, e nossa comida não seria suficiente. De uma maneira Ou de outra,
temos de achar o Vau do Bruinen.
Pelo resto daquele dia, avançaram aos tropeços sobre o solo pedregoso. Encontraram uma
passagem entre duas colinas, que os conduziu a um vale que ia do sul para
o leste, a direção que queriam tomar; mas no fim do dia descobriram que seu caminho
estava novamente bloqueado por uma cordilheira; os topos escuros, contrastando
com o céu, quebravam-se em muitas pontas nuas, como os dentes de um serrote cego. Podiam
escolher entre voltar ou escalar.
Decidiram tentar a escalada, que resultou em muita dificuldade. Logo Frodo foi obrigado a
descer do pônei e caminhar, o que fazia à custa de muito esforço. Mesmo
assim, várias vezes quase perderam as esperanças de conseguir levar o pônei colina acima,
ou até de achar uma trilha para eles mesmos, carregados de coisas como
estavam. A luz já tinha quase se extinguido, e estavam exaustos, quando finalmente
atingiram o topo. Tinham escalado

#216
até um passo estreito entre dois pontos mais altos, e o terreno descia íngreme novamente,
apenas um pouco à frente. Frodo se jogou no chão e ficou deitado,
tremendo. Seu braço esquerdo estava paralisado, e sentia como se garras de gelo
segurassem seu ombro e flanco. As árvores e rochas ao redor pareciam sombrias e escuras.
- Não podemos continuar - disse Merry a Passolargo. - Receio que isso tenha sido demais
para Frodo. Estou terrivelmente aflito por ele. Que devemos fazer? Você acha
que poderão curá-lo em Valfenda, se chegarmos lá?
- Veremos - respondeu Passolargo. - Não há mais nada que eu possa fazer nesta região
deserta; e é principalmente por causa do ferimento dele que estou tão ansioso
por continuar. Mas concordo que não podemos prosseguir esta noite.
- Qual é o problema com meu patrão? - perguntou Sam em voz baixa, olhando desesperado
para Passolargo. O ferimento foi pequeno, e já está fechado. Não se vê nada
a não ser uma marca fria e branca em seu ombro.
- Frodo foi tocado pelas armas do Inimigo - disse Passolargo. - E há algum veneno ou
maleficio em ação, que está além da minha habilidade de expulsar. Mas não perca
a esperança, Sam!
A noite era fria sobre o alto desfiladeiro. Acenderam uma pequena fogueira sob as raizes
retorcidas de um velho pinheiro, que se curvava sobre uma cavidade rasa:
parecia que uma pedra tinha sido extraída dali. Sentaram-se, uns aconchegados aos outros.
O vento soprava frio através da passagem, e eles escutaram as copas das
árvores abaixo gemendo e suspirando. Frodo entrara numa espécie de delírio, imaginando
que asas escuras e infinitas pairavam sobre ele, e que montando as asas estavam
perseguidores que o procuravam em todas as concavidades das colinas.
O dia amanheceu claro e bonito; o ar estava limpo, e a luz era pálida no céu recentemente
lavado pela chuva. Os corações se sentiram mais fortes, mas eles queriam
que o sol aquecesse suas pernas e braços, que estavam enregelados e duros. Assim que
ficou claro, Passolargo foi olhar a região do ponto que ficava ao leste da passagem,
levando Merry consigo. O sol tinha se levantado, e brilhava forte, quando voltou com
notícias mais animadoras. Estavam agora indo mais ou menos na direção correta.
Se continuassem pela encosta da cordilheira, teriam as Montanhas à sua esquerda. Alguma
distância à frente, Passolargo tinha visto um trecho do Ruidoságua de novo,
e sabia que, embora estivesse escondida, a Estrada para o Vau não estava longe do Rio, e
ficava na margem mais próxima do ponto onde estavam.
- Devemos voltar para a Estrada de novo - disse ele. - Não há esperança de acharmos uma
trilha através destas colinas. Apesar de todo o perigo que correremos ali,
a Estrada é o único caminho para o Vau.
#217
Logo após comerem, partiram novamente. Desceram devagar a encosta sul da cordilheira; mas
o caminho foi bem mais fácil do que esperavam, pois a descida era muito
menos íngreme desse lado, e logo Frodo pôde montar de novo. O pobre e velho pônei de Bill
Samambaia estava desenvolvendo um talento inesperado para achar uma trilha,
e para evitar ao máximo qualquer solavanco que pudesse perturbar seu montador. Os ânimos
do grupo se elevaram de novo. Até Frodo se sentia muito melhor na luz da
manhã, mas de quando em quando uma névoa parecia obscurecer sua visão, e ele passava as
mãos sobre os olhos.
Pippin estava um pouco à frente dos outros. De repente, voltou-se e gritou: - Há uma
trilha aqui!
Quando os outros o alcançaram, viram que não tinha sido engano: via-se claramente o
início de uma trilha, que subia com muitas curvas, saindo da floresta abaixo,
e desaparecia no topo da colina atrás deles. Em alguns pontos, estava agora apagada e
coberta de vegetação, ou sufocada por árvores e pedras caídas; mas parecia

ter sido muito usada em alguma época. Era uma trilha feita por braços fortes e pés
pesados. Aqui e ali velhas árvores tinham sido cortadas ou arrancadas, e grandes
rochas cortadas ou colocadas de lado para abrir caminho.
Seguiram a trilha por um tempo, pois ela oferecia o caminho mais fácil até lá embaixo,
mas iam com cuidado, e a ansiedade aumentou quando chegaram na floresta escura,
e a trilha ficou mais plana e larga. De súbito, saindo de uma faixa de pinheiros, viram
uma ladeira íngreme que descia, e virava para a esquerda num ângulo fechado,
contornando uma saliência rochosa da colina. Quando atingiram a curva, viram que a trilha
continuava numa faixa plana sob a parede de um rochedo baixo coberto de
árvores. Na muralha de pedra havia uma porta entreaberta, que pendia torta e aberta,
presa por uma grande dobradiça.
Do lado de fora da porta, pararam. Havia uma caverna semelhante a uma câmara de pedra
atrás dela, mas na escuridão não se via nada. Passolargo, Sam e Merry, empurrando
com toda a força que tinham, conseguiram abrir a porta um pouco mais, e então Passolargo
e Merry entraram. Não foram muito longe, pois no chão havia muitos ossos
velhos, e nada mais se via perto da porta, a não ser algumas vasilhas grandes e vazias, e
potes quebrados.
- Certamente, esta é uma toca de trolls, se é que isso existe! - disse Pippin. - Venham,
vocês dois, e vamos sair daqui. Agora sabemos quem fez a trilha, e é melhor
irmos embora rápido.
- Não vejo necessidade, eu acho - disse Passolargo, saindo. - Certamente, esta é uma toca
de trolls, mas parece abandonada há muito tempo. Não acho que precisamos
ficar com medo. Mas vamos descer com cuidado, e veremos.
#218
A trilha continuava de novo depois da porta e, virando mais uma vez para a direita
através do espaço plano, mergulhava numa ladeira coberta por vegetação densa.
Pippin, não querendo demonstrar a Passolargo que ainda sentia medo, foi à frente com
Merry. Sam e Passolargo vieram atrás, um de cada lado do pônei de Frodo, pois
agora a trilha era larga o suficiente para permitir que quatro ou cinco hobbits andassem
lado a lado. Mas não tinham ido muito longe quando Pippin voltou correndo,
seguido por Merry. Os dois pareciam apavorados.
- Há trolls! - ofegou Pippin. - Ali embaixo, numa clareira na floresta, não muito
distante. Vimo-los de relance entre os troncos de árvores. São muito grandes!
- Vamos lá dar uma olhada - disse Passolargo, pegando um pau. Frodo não disse nada, mas
Sam parecia amedrontado.
Agora o sol estava alto, brilhando através dos ramos seminus das árvores, iluminando a
clareira com raios de luz intensa. Pararam de repente na borda, e espiaram
através dos troncos das árvores, segurando a respiração. Ali estavam os trolls: três
grandes trolls. Um estava agachado, enquanto os outros dois o observavam.
Passolargo avançou indiferente. - Levante, pedra velha! - disse ele, arrebentando o pau
no troll agachado.
Nada aconteceu. Pasmos, os hobbits ficaram de boca aberta, e depois até Frodo riu. - Bem!
- disse ele. - Estamos esquecendo a história de nossa família! Estes devem
ser exatamente aqueles três que foram capturados por Gandalf, e que estavam discutindo
sobre a melhor maneira de se cozinhar treze anões e um hobbit.
- Não tinha idéia de que estivéssemos perto do lugar! - disse Pippin, que conhecia bem a
história. Bilbo e Frodo sempre a contavam, mas na verdade ele nunca acreditara
nela completamente. Mesmo agora, olhava para os trolls de pedra com suspeita, imaginando
se algum tipo de mágica não os traria de volta à vida novamente.
- Vocês estão esquecendo não só a história da família, mas também tudo o que sabiam sobre
trolls - disse Passolargo. - Estamos em plena luz do dia, com o sol brilhando,
e vocês voltam tentando me assustar com uma história de trolls vivos esperando por nós na
clareira! De qualquer forma, poderiam ter notado que um deles tem um velho
ninho de passarinho atrás da orelha. Esse é um enfeite muito singular para um troll vivo.
Todos riram. Frodo sentiu seu ânimo renascer: a lembrança da primeira aventura bemsucedida de Bilbo era encorajadora.

O sol, também, estava quente e reconfortante,
e a névoa que cobria seus olhos parecia estar se desvanecendo um pouco. Descansaram por
um tempo na clareira, e fizeram
#219

a refeição do meio-dia bem embaixo da sombra das grandes pernas dos trolls.
- Alguém não poderia cantar uma canção, nessa hora em que o sol está tão alto? - disse
Merry, quando tinham terminado de comer. - Não escutamos uma canção ou história
há dias.
- Desde o Topo do Vento - disse Frodo. Os outros olharam para ele. Não se preocupem
comigo! - acrescentou. - Sinto-me muito melhor, mas não acho que poderia cantar.
Talvez Sam consiga cavar alguma coisa em sua memória.
-Vamos lá, Sam! - disse Merry. - Existem mais coisas armazenadas na sua memória do que
você dá a conhecer.
- Não sei nada disso - disse Sam. - Mas será que esta cairia bem? Não é exatamente o que
eu chamaria de poesia, se é que me entendem: apenas um pouco de besteira.
Mas essas imagens antigas daqui me fizeram lembrar. - Em pé, com as mãos atrás das
costas, como se estivesse na escola, começou a cantar uma melodia antiga.
Troll no calabouço, só sem alvoroço, Sentado resmunga, roendo um velho osso; Por anos sem
conta, roia a mesma ponta,
Pois carnejamais encontrava. Rosnava! Chiava!
Sentado, sozinho, em seu calabouço, E carnejamais encontrava.
Surge Tom agora de bota e de espora. Ejá vai dizendo: - O que você devora?
Parece, isso sim, a canela do tio Tim, Que devia estar em sua sepultura. Dura! Escura!
Já faz um tempào que meu tio foi embora,
E eu achava que estava em sua sepultura.
- Bem, diz o safado, o ossofoi roubado.
Mas pra que é que serve um osso enterrado? Já estava bem frio, feito gelo, o titio, Antes
de eu pegar sua canela.
Bela! Gela!
E ele a quis darpara um velho coitado, Já que não precisava mais dela.
#220
Diz Tom: - Não consigo entender como o amigo, Sem terpermissão, vai e leva consigo
Chanca ou canela de minha parentela. Então me dá logo esse osso! Grosso! Insosso!
É dele, eu te digo, o que tinha consigo. Então me dá logo esse osso!
- Por uma bagatela, diz Troll tagarela, Também como você e rôo sua canela. Essa carne
macia, que gostosa seria!
Deixa eu dar uma mordida. Urdida!Ardida! Já cansei de roer esta velha canela.
Tô afim de vocêpor comida.
Mas quando Trolljulgava que ojantar agarrava, Percebeu que sua mão nada mais segurava.
Rápido, num zás, Tom passou para trás
E meteu-lhe a botina. Sina!Atina! Um bom chute no assento, Tom pensava,
E agora vai ver que ele atina!
Mas dura qual caroço é a carne com osso De um troll instalado em seu calabouço, Melhor é
chutar uma pedra tumular
Porque assento de troll nada sente. Mente? Tente!
Riu Troll quando Tom gemeu em alvoroço, Sabendo o que um dedão sente.
E Tom hoje anda coxo, depois que voltou mocho Seu pé sem botina está sempre meio roxo.
Mas Troll numa boa, continua sempre à toa, Roendo seu osso roubado.
Dado! Fado! Sentado, só, velho e chocho, Roendo seu osso roubado!
Bem, isso é um aviso para todos nós - riu Merry. - Foi bom que você usou um pau, e não a
mão, Passolargo!

- De onde você desenterrou essa, Sam? - perguntou Pippin. - Nunca escutei essa letra
antes.
Sam murmurou algo inaudível. - Da própria cabeça dele, é claro disse Frodo. - Estou
aprendendo muito sobre Sam
Gamgi nesta viagem. primeiro era um conspirador,
agora um bufão. Vai acabar se revelando um mago - ou um guerreiro!
- Espero que não - disse Sam. - Não quero ser nenhum dos dois!
De tarde, avançaram, descendo pela floresta. Provavelmente estavam seguindo a mesma
trilha que Gandalf, Bilbo e os anões tinham usado havia muitos anos. Depois de
algumas milhas, saíram no topo de um barranco alto sobre a Estrada. Nesse ponto, a
Estrada já tinha deixado o Fontegris bem atrás em seu vale estreito, e agora se
prendia ao sopé das colinas, rolando e ziguezagueando em direção ao leste, entre
florestas e encostas cobertas por urzais, seguindo para o Vau e as Montanhas. Não
muito abaixo do barranco, Passolargo apontou para uma rocha sobre o capim. Nela estavam
entalhadas, de forma rude e agora bem gastas, runas de anões e marcas secretas.
- Vejam! - disse Merry. -Aquela deve ser a pedra que marcava o lugar onde o ouro dos
trolls estava escondido. - Quanto você acha que restou da parte de Bilbo, Frodo?
Frodo olhou a pedra, desejando que Bilbo não tivesse trazido para casa nenhum tesouro
mais perigoso, nem mais dificil de abandonar. - Nada! disse ele. - Bilbo doou
tudo. Disse-me que nao sentia que o tesouro era realmente dele, uma vez que vinha de
ladrões.
A Estrada se estendia quieta, sob as sombras compridas do início da noite. Não se via
qualquer sinal de viajantes. Como agora não havia outro caminho que pudessem
tomar, desceram o barranco, e virando à esquerda avançaram o mais rapido possível. Logo
uma saliência nas colinas bloqueou a luz do sol que se deitava rápido no
oeste. Um vento frio descia ao seu encontro, vindo das montanhas à frente.
Estavam começando a procurar um lugar fora da Estrada, onde pudessem acampar durante a
noite, quando ouviram um som que trouxe um pavor repentino de volta aos seus
corações: o ruído de cascos atrás deles. Olharam para trás, mas não podiam enxergar muito
longe por causa das várias curvas da Estrada. Com a máxima velocidade possível,
deixaram aos tropeços o caminho batido, penetrando na densa vegetação de urzais e
mirtilos que cobria as encostas acima, até que chegaram num pequeno trecho coberto
por densas aveleiras. Ao espiarem por entre os arbustos, puderam ver a Estrada, apagada e
cinzenta sob a luz que enfraquecia, cerca de dez metros abaixo de onde
estavam. O som dos cascos se aproximou. Avançavam rápido, com um
#222

suave clipete-clípete-clipe. Então ouviram baixinho, como que carregado pela brisa, um
som suave, como se pequenos sinos estivessem tocando.
- Esse não parece um cavalo dos Cavaleiros Negros! - disse Frodo, escutando atentamente.
Os outros hobbits concordaram esperançosos mas todos permaneceram cheios
de suspeitas. Tinham sentido medo de perseguíções por tanto tempo que qualquer som atrás
deles parecia agourento e hostil. Mas Passolargo agora se curvava para frente,
e, abaixando-se até o chão, com uma mão sobre a orelha, fez uma expressão de alegria.
A luz desaparecia, e as folhas e arbustos farfalhavam suavemente. Os sinos agora soavam
alto e mais perto; clípete-clipe, vinham as patas em trote rápido. De repente
apareceu, lá embaixo, um cavalo branco, reluzindo nas sombras, correndo muito. No
crepúsculo, a testeira brilhava e reluzia, como se estivesse adornada com pedras
que pareciam estrelas. A capa do cavaleiro flutuava nas suas costas, e o capuz estava
jogado para trás; o cabelo dourado esvoaçava brilhante no vento veloz. Frodo
teve a impressão de que uma luz branca brilhava através da figura e das vestes do
cavaleiro, como se viesse através de um véu
tênue.
Passolargo pulou do esconderijo e correu em direção à Estrada, saltando com um grito
através do urzal; mas antes mesmo que tivesse se movido ou gritado, o cavaleiro

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
puxou as rédeas e parou, olhando para cima em direção à moita onde estavam. Quando viu
Passolargo, desceu do cavalo e correu para encontrá-lo, gritando: Ai na vedui
Dúnadan! Alae govannen!
A fala e a voz clara, musical, não deixavam dúvidas nos corações: o cavaleiro era do povo
élfico. Nenhuma outra criatura habitante do vasto
mundo tinha uma voz tão bela e agradável de escutar. Mas parecia haver um tom de aflição
naquele chamado, e eles viram que agora ele falava com Passolargo cheio
de ansiedade e urgência.
Logo Passolargo fez um sinal, e os hobbits saíram dos arbustos, correndo para a Estrada.
- Este é Glorfindel, que mora na casa de Elrond disse ele.
- Salve, que bom que finalmente os encontrei! - disse o Senhor-élfico a Frodo. - Fui
enviado de Valfenda para encontrá-los. Temíamos que estivessem correndo perigo
na estrada.
- Então Gandalf chegou a Valfenda - gritou Frodo cheio de alegria.
- Não. Ainda não tinha chegado quando parti, mas isso já faz muitos dias - respondeu
Glorfindel. - Elrond recebeu uma notícia que o preocupou. Alguns de meu povo,
viajando por sua terra além do Baranduin, souberam que as coisas deram errado, e enviaram
mensagens o mais rápido possível. Disseram que os Nove estavam espalhados,
e que vocês estavam
1. O rio Brandevin.
#223
perdidos, carregando um fardo pesado, sem orientação, pois Gandalf não tinha voltado. Até
mesmo em Valfenda existem poucas pessoas que podem cavalgar abertamente
contra os Nove; mas do jeito que as coisas estavam, Elrond enviou mensageiros para o
Norte, Oeste e Sul. Pensou-se que vocês poderiam ter mudado de direção para
evitar os perseguidores, e perdido o rumo nesse lugar deserto.
- A parte designada a mim foi pegar a Estrada, e eu cheguei até a Ponte de Mitheithel,
deixando ali um sinal, há sete dias. Três dos servidores de Sauron estiveram
na Ponte, mas retiraram-se e os persegui em direção ao norte. Também encontrei outros
dois, mas eles rumaram para o sul. Desde então tenho procurado sua trilha.
Há dois dias a encontrei, e a segui através da Ponte; hoje observei o ponto por onde
voltaram e desceram das colinas de novo. Mas venham! Não há tempo para mais
notícias. Já que estão aqui, devemos correr o perigo da Estrada e ir. Há cinco deles
atrás de nós, e quando encontrarem suas pegadas na Estrada, virão atrás de vocês
como o vento. E não são todos. Onde estão os outros, eu não sei. Receio que o Vau já
esteja tomado pelos inimigos.
Enquanto Glorfindel falava, as sombras da noite aumentaram. Frodo sentiu um grande
cansaço tomando conta de seu corpo. Desde que o sol começara a se pôr, a névoa
sobre seus olhos tinha ficado mais densa, e ele sentia que uma sombra começava a se
instalar entre ele e os rostos dos amigos. Agora a dor o acometia, e ele sentia
frio. Estava zonzo, e se agarrava ao braço de Sam.
- Meu patrão está doente e ferido - disse Sam furioso. - Ele não pode continuar montando
depois do cair da noite. Precisa descansar.
Glorfindel segurou Frodo, que quase caía ao chão, e tomando-o gentilmente nos braços,
olhou seu rosto com grande ansiedade.
Rapidamente, Passolargo contou-lhe sobre o ataque ao acampamento no Topo do Vento, e da
faca mortal. Pegou o cabo, que tinha guardado, estendendo-o ao elfo. Glorfindel
tremeu ao pegá-lo, mas continuou observando-o com grande atenção.
- Há coisas maléficas escritas neste cabo - disse ele. - Apesar de seus olhos não poderem
vê-las. Guarde-o, Aragorn, até que cheguemos à casa de Elrond! Mas tenha
cuidado, e toque-o o menos possível. Infelizmente, os ferimentos causados por esta faca
estão além de meu poder de cura. Farei o que puder - mas o que acho mais
necessário agora é partir sem descanso.
Ele procurou o ferimento no ombro de Frodo com os dedos, e seu rosto ficou mais sério,
como se o que tivesse concluído o preocupasse. Mas Frodo sentiu que o frio

diminuía em seu flanco e braço; um pequeno calor se espalhava do ombro para a mão, e a
dor ficou mais suportável. A escuridão do início da noite parecia ficar menos
densa à sua volta, como se uma nuvem
#224
tivesse sido retirada. Via de novo os rostos dos amigos mais claramente, e
retornou a seu coração um bocado de nova esperança e força.
- Você montará meu cavalo - disse Glorfindel. - Vou encurtar o estribo até a aba da sela,
e você deve sentar-se o mais firme que conseguir. Mas não precisa ter medo:
meu cavalo não deixa cair nenhum cavaleiro que eu ordene que ele conduza. Seu passo é
leve e suave; se o perigo chegar perto demais, ele o levará para longe com
uma velocidade que nem os cavalos do inimigo podem alcançar.
- Não, ele não deve fazer isso! - disse Frodo. - Não vou montá-lo, se ele me levar para
Valfenda ou qualquer outro lugar, deixando meus amigos para trás e em perigo.
Glorfindel sorriu. - Duvido muito que seus amigos fiquem em perigo se não estiverem com
você - disse ele. -A perseguição continuaria atrás de você, deixando-nos
em paz. É você, Frodo, e o que você carrega, que nos traz todo o perigo.
Frodo não teve resposta para aquilo, e foi persuadido a montar o cavalo branco de
Glorfindel.
O pônei foi então carregado com a maioria dos fardos dos outros, de
modo que agora todos marcharam mais facilmente, e por um período avançaram com boa
velocidade; mas os hobbits começaram a ter dificuldade em acompanhar o ritmo dos
pés rápidos e descansados do elfo. E adiante ele os conduziu, para dentro da escuridão, e
continuou em frente, sob as nuvens densas da noite. Não havia lua nem estrelas.
Só quando viram a aurora cinzenta é que permitiu que parassem. Sam, Merry e Pippin
estavam naquela hora quase dormindo sobre as pernas cambaleantes; e até mesmo
Passolargo dava sinais de cansaço, que se manifestava em seus ombros curvados. Frodo
montava o cavalo num sonho escuro.
Abrigaram-se sob o urzal que ficava a alguns metros da borda da estrada, e adormeceram
imediatamente. Parecia-lhes que mal tinham fechado os olhos, quando Glorfindel,
que tinha montado guarda enquanto dormiam, acordou-os de novo. O sol já tinha subido
bastante no céu, e as nuvens e a névoa da noite tinham se dissipado.
- Bebam isso - disse a eles Glorfindel, derramando para um de cada vez um pouco de uma
bebida, de um frasco de couro adornado de prata.
O líquido era transparente
como água, não tinha gosto, e ao contato com a boca não era nem frio nem quente; mas
parecia que força e vigor fluíam-lhes para os braços e as pernas ao beberem
dele. Depois disso, comer o pão velho e as frutas secas (que era tudo o que restava
agora) parecia satisfazer-lhes a fome mais do que os melhores desjejuns do Condado.
Tinham descansado menos que cinco horas quando pegaram a Estrada de novo. Glorfindel
ainda forçou a viagem, e só permitiu duas paradas rápidas
#225
durante todo o dia de marcha. Desse jeito, cobriram quase vinte milhas antes do cair da
noite, e chegaram a um ponto onde a Estrada fazia uma curva à direita,
e descia em direção ao fundo do vale, indo direto para o Bruinen. Até agora, não tinha
havido sinais ou ruídos da perseguição, mas freqüentemente Glorfindel parava
para escutar por uns momentos, quando eles ficavam para trás, e uma expressão ansiosa
cobria seu rosto. Uma ou duas vezes, dirigiu-se a Passolargo na língua élfica.
Mas por mais ansiosos que os guias estivessem, era ponto pacífico que os hobbits não
podiam mais prosseguir aquela noite. Iam tropeçando, zonzos e cansados. A dor
de Frodo tinha redobrado, e durante o dia as coisas à sua volta tinham se embaçado em
sombras de um cinza fantasmagórico. Ele quase recebeu com alegria a chegada
da noite, pois então o mundo parecia menos pálido e vazio.
Os hobbits ainda estavam cansados quando partiram de novo, no dia seguinte bem cedo.
Ainda havia muitas milhas a percorrer até o Vau, e eles avançavam mancando,

no melhor ritmo possível.
- Nosso perigo ficará maior um pouco antes de atingirmos o rio disse Glorfindel. - Meu
coração me adverte que os perseguidores estão vindo rápido atrás de nós, e
outros perigos podem estar à espera no Vau.
A Estrada ainda descia a colina íngreme, e agora em alguns pontos havia bastante capim
dos dois lados, no qual os hobbits iam pisando quando podiam, para aliviar
o cansaço dos pés. No fim da tarde, chegaram a um lugar onde a Estrada entrava
abruptamente embaixo da sombra escura de pinheiros altos, e então mergulhava num valo
profundo, com paredes íngremes e úmidas de pedra vermelha. Ecos reverberavam à medida que
avançavam com pressa e parecia haver o ruído de muitos passos, seguindo
os passos deles. De repente, como se por um portão de luz, a Estrada saiu novamente da
extremidade do túnel para o espaço aberto. Ali, na base de uma subida íngreme,
viram adiante um trecho comprido e plano, e além dele o Vau de Valfenda. Na margem
oposta, havia um barranco inclinado e escuro, marcado por uma trilha tortuosa;
mais além, as montanhas altas subiam, saliência após saliência, e pico além de pico, para
dentro do céu que se apagava.
Ainda se ouvia um som como o de pés perseguindo-os no valo; um ruído que se apressava,
como se um vento se levantasse, derramando-se através dos ramos dos pinheiros.
Num momento, Glorfindel se virou para escutar, e então jogou-se para frente com um grito:
- Fujam! - gritou ele. - Fujam! O inimigo está nos alcançando!
O cavalo branco saltou para frente. Os hobbits correram, descendo a ladeira. Glorfindel e
Passolargo seguiam na retaguarda. Tinham atravessado apenas metade daquele
espaço plano, quando de repente escutaram o galope de cavalos. Saindo por entre as
árvores que tinham deixado havia pouco
#226
co, viram um Cavaleiro Negro a galope. Puxou as rédeas de seu cavalo e parou, oscilando
na sela. Um outro o seguiu, e depois outro, e mais dois ainda.
- Vá embora! Galope! - gritou Glorfindel para Frodo.
Ele não obedeceu imediatamente, pois uma estranha relutância o segurava. Fazendo o cavalo
andar, voltou-se e olhou para trás. Os Cavaleiros pareciam montar seus
grandes cavalos como estátuas ameaçadoras sobre uma colina, enquanto toda a floresta e as
terras à sua volta se retraíam dentro de uma espécie de névoa. De repente,
percebeu que eles, em silêncio, ordenavam que esperasse. Então, de imediato, o medo e o
ódio acordaram de 'ntro dele. Sua mão abandonou a rédea e empunhou a espada,
e com um clarão vermelho a desembainhou.
- Galope! Galope! - gritou Glorfindel, e então, alto e bom som, gritou para o cavalo na
língua élfica: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth! Imediatamente, o cavalo saltou
e correu como o vento ao longo do
último trecho da Estrada. No mesmo momento, os cavalos negros vieram descendo a colina em
perseguição, e dos Cavaleiros vinha um grito terrível, como aquele que
Frodo escutara enchendo a floresta de terror na Quarta Leste, lá longe. Houve resposta; e
para a infelicidade de Frodo e seus amigos, das árvores e rochas à sua
esquerda, quatro outros Cavaleiros saíram em disparada. Dois vinham na direção de Frodo;
dois galopavam alucinadamente para o Vau, para impedir sua fuga. Frodo tinha
a impressão de que corriam como o vento, ficando rapidamente maiores e mais escuros, à
medida que o trajeto que faziam convergia com o dele.
Frodo por um instante olho para trás, por sobre os ombros. Não conseguia mais ver os
amigos. Os Cavaleiros estavam ficando para trás: nem mesmo seus grandes animais
eram páreo em velocidade para o cavalo branco de Glorfindel. Olhou para frente de novo, e
perdeu as esperanças. Parecia não haver chance de atingir o Vau antes de
ser interceptado pelos outros, que esperavam numa emboscada. Agora podia vê-los com
nitidez: parecia que tinham deixado de lado os capuzes e as capas pretas, e estavam
vestidos de branco e cinza. As espadas estavam nuas nas mãos pálidas, elmos cobriam suas
cabeças. Os olhos frios brilhavam, e eles o chamavam com vozes cruéis.
Agora o medo havia tomado conta da mente de Frodo. Não pensou mais em sua espada. Nenhum
grito partiu dele. Fechou os olhos e agarrou-se à crina do cavalo.

O vento
assobiava em seus ouvidos, e os sinos dos arreios tilintavam frenética e
estriduladamente. Um sopro de frio mortal o atravessou como uma lança quando, num último
esforço, semelhante a um clarão de fogo branco, o cavalo élfico, como se estivesse
voando, passou bem diante do rosto do Cavaleiro que ia na frente.
Frodo ouviu a água espirrar, espumando sob seus pés. Sentiu-a avançar e depois se
afastar, quando o cavalo deixava o rio e se esforçava para
#227
subir o caminho de pedra. Estava subindo o barranco inclinado. Tinha atravessado o Vau.
Mas os perseguidores vinham logo atrás. No topo do barranco, o cavalo parou e se voltou,
relinchando furiosamente. Havia Nove Cavaleiros na beira da água lá embaixo,
e o ânimo de Frodo fraquejou diante da ameaça daqueles rostos voltados para cima. Não
conseguia pensar em nada que pudesse impedir que eles atravessassem o Vau com
a rapidez com que ele o fizera, e sentia que era inútil tentar escapar pelo caminho
comprido e incerto que ia do Vau até o limite de Valfenda, se os Cavaleiros chegassem
a atravessar. De qualquer maneira, sentiu-se forçado a parar. O ódio mais uma vez se
agitava nele, mas não tinha mais força para se recusar.
De repente, o Cavaleiro mais próximo esporeou seu cavalo, forçando-o a avançar.
O cavalo refreou ao toque da água, empinando nas patas traseiras. Com grande esforço,
Frodo sentou-se ereto e brandiu a espada.
- Voltem! - gritou ele. - Voltem para a Terra de Mordor, e não me sigam mais! - Sua voz
soava fina e trêmula aos seus próprios ouvidos. Os Cavaleiros pararam, mas
Frodo não tinha o poder de Tom Bombadil. Seus inimigos riam dele, com um riso rude e
arrepiante. - Volte! Volte! - gritavam eles. - Vamos levá-lo para Mordor!
- Voltem! - sussurrou ele.
- O Anel! O Anel! - gritavam eles com vozes mortais, e imediatamente o líder forçou o
cavalo para dentro da água, seguido de perto por outros dois. Por Elbereth
e Lúthien, a Bela - disse Frodo num último esforço, levantando a espada. - Vocês não
terão nem o Anel, nem a mim!
Então o líder, que já tinha atravessado o Vau até a metade, levantou-se nos estribos,
ameaçador, e ergueu a mão. Frodo foi tomado por uma espécie de adormecimento.
Sentia a língua aderindo à boca, e o coração batendo com dificuldade. Sua espada quebrou
e caiu da mão trêmula.
O cavalo élfico empinou, bufando. O cavalo negro que vinha à frente já tinha quase saído
da água.
Naquele momento, houve um trovão e um estrondo: um ruído enorme de águas fazendo rolar
muitas pedras. Com a visão embaçada, Frodo conseguiu distinguir o movimento
do rio embaixo dele se levantando, e descendo seu curso veio uma cavalaria emplumada de
ondas brancas. Parecia a Frodo que chamas brancas piscavam nas cristas das
ondas, e ele imaginou enxergar no meio da água cavaleiros brancos sobre cavalos brancos,
com crinas espumantes. Os três Cavaleiros que ainda estavam na água sucumbiram:
desapareceram, subitamente cobertos pela espuma furiosa. Os que estavam atrás recuaram,
com medo.
Com os sentidos já bem fracos, Frodo escutou gritos, e teve a impressão de ver, atrás dos
Cavaleiros que hesitavam na beira da água, uma figura
#228
brilhante de luz branca; e atrás dela corriam pequenas formas sombrias, acenando com
chamas, que brilhavam na névoa cinzenta que caía sobre o mundo.
Os cavalos negros ficaram alucinados, e, pulando para frente, apavorados, conduziram os
cavaleiros para dentro da enchente que avançava. Seus gritos agudos foram
afogados no ruído do rio, que os carregava para longe. Então Frodo sentiu que estava
caindo, e o ruído e a confusão pareceram aumentar e engoli-lo, juntamente com
os inimigos. Não escutou nem viu mais nada.

LIVRO II
#230
CAPíTULO I
MUITOS ENCONTROS

#231
Ao acordar, Frodo se viu deitado numa cama. Num primeiro momento, pensou ter perdido a
hora, depois de um sonho desagradável que ainda pairava no limiar de sua
memória, Ou, quem sabe, estivera doente? Mas o teto parecia estranho; era plano, com
vigas esplendidamente entalhadas. Ficou deitado por mais um tempo, olhando para
a luz do sol projetada na parede, e escutando o som de uma cachoeira.
- Onde estou, e que horas são? - disse ele em voz alta para o teto.
- Na Casa de Elrond, e são dez da manhã - disse uma voz. - Estamos na manhã do dia 24 de
outubro, se quiser saber.
- Gandalfl. - gritou Frodo, sentando-se. Ali estava o velho mago, sentado numa poltrona
próxima à janela aberta.
- Sim - disse ele. - E você tem sorte por estar aqui, também, depois de todas as coisas
absurdas que fez desde que saiu de casa.
Frodo se deitou de novo. Sentia-se bem demais para discutir, e de qualquer forma não
julgava que levaria a melhor numa discussão. Estava inteiramente acordado agora,
e a lembrança da viagem retornava à sua mente: o "atalho" desastroso através da Floresta
Velha, o "acidente" no Pônei Saltitante, e a loucura de colocar o Anel naquele
valezinho embaixo do Topo do Vento. Enquanto pensava em todas essas coisas e tentava em
vão recordar sua chegada a Valfenda, houve um longo silêncio, apenas quebrado
pelas suaves baforadas do cachimbo de Gandalf, que soprava anéis de fumaça branca para
fora da janela.
- Onde está Sam? - perguntou Frodo finalmente. - Tudo bem com os outros?
- Sim, estão sãos e salvos - respondeu Gandalf. - Sam ficou aqui até que o mandei
descansar um pouco, cerca de uma hora atrás.
- O que aconteceu no Vau? - perguntou Frodo. - Parece que tudo estava de alguma forma tão
embaçado; e ainda está.
- De fato. Você estava começando a desaparecer - respondeu Gandalf.
- O ferimento estava finalmente vencendo-o. Mais algumas horas e não poderíamos mais
ajudá-lo. Mas existe uma certa força em você, meu querido hobbit! Demonstrou
isso no Túmulo. Aquilo foi muito arriscado: talvez o momento mais perigoso de todos. Eu
gostaria que tivesse resistido no Topo do Vento.
- Parece que você já sabe de muita coisa - disse Frodo. - Não comentei com os outros
sobre o Túmulo. Em primeiro lugar, foi horrível demais,
#232
e em segundo, havia outras coisas para pensar. Como é que você sabe sobre isso?
- Conversamos longamente durante seu sono, Frodo - disse Gandalf suavemente. - Não foi
dificil para mim ler sua mente e sua memória. Não se preocupe! Embora eu tenha
dito "coisas absurdas" agora há pouco, não foi essa a minha intenção. Tenho você em alta
conta - e os outros também. Não foi pouca coisa chegar até aqui, passando
por tantos perigos, e ainda trazendo o Anel.
- Jamais teria conseguido sem Passolargo

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
- disse Frodo. - Mas precisávamos de você. Eu não sabia o que fazer sem sua ajuda.
- Eu me atrasei - disse Gandalf. - E isso quase foi nossa ruína. Mas, mesmo assim, não
tenho certeza. Talvez tenha sido melhor assim.
- Gostaria que me contasse o que aconteceu.
- Tudo a seu tempo! Você não deve falar e se preocupar com nada hoje. São ordens de
Elrond.
- Mas conversar me faria parar de pensar e imaginar, que são coisas muito cansativas disse Frodo. - Estou plenamente acordado agora, e lembro muitas coisas que
precisam ser explicadas. Por que você se atrasou? Tem de me contar pelo menos isso.
- Logo vai ouvir o que quer saber - disse Gandalf. - Vamos ter um Conselho, logo que você
estiver restabelecido. Por agora, só direi que fui mantido prisioneiro.
- Você? - gritou Frodo.
- Sim, eu, Gandalf, o Cinzento - disse o mago solenemente. - Há muitos poderes no mundo,
trabalhando para o bem e para o mal. Alguns são maiores que eu. Contra alguns,
minhas forças ainda não foram medidas. Mas minha hora está chegando. O senhor de Morgul e
seus Cavaleiros Negros se manifestaram. A guerra está se formando!
- Então você já sabia dos Cavaleiros - antes que eu os encontrasse?
- Sim, sabia da existência deles. Na verdade, mencionei-os uma vez a você, pois os
Cavaleiros Negros são os Espectros do Anel, os Nove Servidores do Senhor dos Anéis.
Mas não sabia que eles tinham novamente se levantado, ou teria fugido com você de
imediato. Só tive notícias deles depois que o deixei em junho; mas essa história
deve esperar. Por enquanto, fomos salvos do desastre, por Aragorn.
- Sim - disse Frodo. - Foi Passolargo quem nos salvou. No entanto, tive medo dele no
começo. Sam nunca confiou de verdade nele, eu acho. De qualquer forma, não até
que encontramos Glorfindel.
Gandalf sorriu. - Já soube tudo sobre Sam - disse ele. - Agora não restam mais dúvidas.
- Fico contente - disse Frodo. - Pois me afeiçoei muito a Passolargo. Bem, afeiçoei não é
bem a palavra. Quero dizer que ele me é muito caro,
#233
embora seja estranho, e às vezes austero. Na verdade, ele sempre me
faz
lembrar você. Não sabia que uma das pessoas grandes podia ser assim. Eu pensava, bem, eu
pensava que eles eram só grandes, e bastante estúpidos: gentis e estúpidos
como Carrapicho, ou estúpidos e maldosos como Bill Samambaia. Mas também não sabemos
muito sobre os homens no Condado, a não ser talvez sobre os moradores de Bri.
- Nem sobre esses você sabe muita coisa, se você acha que o velho Cevado é estúpido disse Gandalf - Ele é muito sábio em seu próprio terreno. Pensa menos do que
fala, e mais devagar; no entanto, ele é capaz de enxergar através de uma parede de
tijolos em tempo (como dizem em Bri). Mas restam poucos na Terra-média como Aragorn,
filho de Arathorri. A raça dos Reis que vieram do outro lado do Mar está quase no fim.
Pode ser que esta Guerra do Anel seja a última aventura deles.
- Quer mesmo dizer que Passolargo faz parte do povo dos antigos Reis? - disse Frodo
surpreso. - Pensei que tivessem todos desaparecido há muito tempo, pensei que
ele fosse apenas um guardião.
- Apenas um guardião! - gritou Gandalf - Meu querido Frodo, é exatamente isso que os
guardiões são: os últimos remanescentes no Norte desse grande povo, os homens
do Oeste. Já me ajudaram antes; e vou precisar da ajuda deles no futuro; agora chegamos a
Valfenda, mas o Anel ainda não está a salvo.
- Acho que não - disse Frodo. Mas, até agora, meu único pensamento foi chegar até aqui,
e espero que não precise ir mais além. É muito agradável apenas descansar.
Tive um mês de exílio e aventura, e acho que para mim chega.
Ficou quieto e fechou os olhos. Depois de uns momentos, falou de novo. - Estive
calculando - disse ele - e a soma dos dias não bate com a data de 24 de outubro.
Deveria ser dia 21. Devemos ter chegado ao Vau no dia 20.
- Você falou e pensou mais do que devia - disse Gandalf. - Como estão seu braço e flanco?
- Não sei - respondeu Frodo. - Não sinto nada: o que é uma melhora, mas - ele fez um
esforço - posso mexer um pouco o braço de novo. Sim, sinto-o voltar à vida.

Não está gelado - acrescentou ele, tocando a mão esquerda com a direita.
- ótimo - disse Gandalf. - Está se recuperando depressa. Logo estará bom de novo.
Elrond o curou: cuidou de você vários dias, desde que foi trazido para cá.
- Dias?
- Bem, quatro noites e três dias, para ser exato. Os elfos o trouxeram do Vau na noite do
dia 20, e foi aí que você perdeu a conta. Estivemos
#234
terrivelmente ansiosos, e Sam quase não deixou o seu lado, dia ou noite, a não ser para
levar recados. Elrond é um mestre das curas, mas as armas do Inimigo são
mortais.
Para lhe dizer a verdade, eu tinha muito pouca esperança, pois suspeitava que havia ainda
algum fragmento da lâmina no ferimento cicatrizado. Mas não foi encontrado
até ontem à noite. Então Elrond removeu um estilhaço. Estava enterrado bem fundo, e
estava afundando cada vez mais.
Frodo tremeu, lembrando a faca cruel com a lâmina manchada, que desaparecera nas mãos de
Passolargo. - Não se assuste! - disse Gandalf. Já passou. O estilhaço foi
derretido. E parece que os hobbits relutam em desaparecer. Conheço fortes guerreiros
entre as pessoas grandes que teriam rapidamente sido vencidos por aquele estilhaço,
que você carregou consigo por dezessete dias.
- Que mal queriam me causar? - perguntou Frodo. - o que os Cavaleiros estavam tentando
fazer?
- Tentaram perfurar seu coração com uma faca de Morgul, que permanece no ferimento. Se
tivessem conseguido, você teria ficado como eles, apenas mais fraco e sob
o seu comando. Teria se transformado num espectro sob o domínio do Senhor do Escuro, que
o torturaria por tentar reter o Anel, se é que existe algum tormento maior
do que ser roubado e vê-lo passando às mãos do Inimigo.
- Ainda bem que não percebi esse perigo terrível! - disse Frodo em voz baixa. - É claro
que estava mortalmente apavorado, mas, se soubesse mais, não teria ousado
nem me mover. É incrível eu ter escapado!
- Sim, a sorte ou o destino o ajudaram - disse Gandalf -, para não falar na coragem. Seu
coração não foi atingido, e apenas o ombro foi perfurado, e isso foi porque
você resistiu até o último momento. Mas você escapou por um fio, como se diz.
O perigo maior que correu foi no momento em que colocou o Anel, pois então estava metade
no mundo dos espectros, e eles poderiam tê-lo agarrado. Você conseguia vê-los, e eles
conseguiam ver você.
- Eu sei - disse Frodo. - Foi terrível olhar para eles! Mas por que todos nós
conseguíamos enxergar os cavalos?
- Porque os cavalos são reais; assim como os mantos negros são roupas reais que eles usam
para dar forma à sua propria inexistência, quando têm de lidar com os vivos.
- Então por que esses cavalos negros agüentam tais cavaleiros? Todos os outros animais se
apavoram quando eles se aproximam, até mesmo o cavalo élfico de Glorfindel.
Cachorros uivam e gansos berram na presença deles.
- Porque esses cavalos nascem e são criados a serviço do Senhor do Escuro em Mordor. Nem
todos os seus servidores e empregados são espectros!
#235
Há orcs e trolls, há wargs e lobisomens; houve e ainda há muitos homens, guerreiros e
reis, que andam vivos sob o sol, e mesmo assim estão sob seu domínio.
E o número desses homens cresce dia a dia.
- Que me diz de Valfenda e dos elfos? Valfenda é um lugar seguro? sim, atualmente, até
que todo o resto tenha sido conquistado. Os elfos podem temer o Senhor do
Escuro, e podem fugir de sua presença, mas nunca mais irão escutá-lo ou servi-lo. E aqui
em Valfenda ainda vivem alguns dos maiores inimigos dele: os Sábios élficos,
senhores de Eldar, de além dos mares mais distantes. Estes não temem os Espectros do
Anel, pois os que moraram no Reino Abençoado vivem ao mesmo tempo nos dois

mundos, e têm grande poder contra os Visíveis e os Invisíveis.
- Pensei ter visto uma figura branca que brilhava e não se apagava como as outras. Então
era Glorfindel?
- Sim. Por um momento você o viu como ele é do outro lado: um dos poderosos entre os
Primogênitos. Ele é um senhor élfico de uma casa de príncipes. Na verdade, existe
um poder em Valfenda capaz de resistir à força de Mordor, por um tempo: e em outros
lugares ainda moram outros poderes. Existe poder, também, de um outro tipo no
Condado. Mas todos esses lugares logo vão se transformar em ilhas sob um cerco, se as
coisas continuarem a se encaminhar desse modo.
O Senhor do Escuro está lançando
toda sua força.
- Mesmo assim... - disse ele, levantando-se de repente e empinando o queixo para frente,
o que fez com que sua barba acompanhasse o movimento, reta e dura, como
arame eriçado. - Mesmo assim, devemos conservar a coragem. Logo você estará bem, se eu
não exaurir suas forças com tantas conversas. Você está em Valfenda, e não
precisa se preocupar com nada no momento.
- Não tenho coragem alguma para conservar - disse Frodo. - Mas não estou preocupado no
momento. Apenas me dê notícias de meus amigos, e me conte o fim do episódio
no Vau, como já pedi várias vezes, e vou ficar satisfeito por enquanto. Depois disso vou
dormir mais um pouco, eu acho; mas não conseguirei fechar os olhos antes
que você me conte a história até o fim
Gandalf levou a poltrona até o lado da cama, e olhou Frodo demoradamente. A cor voltara
às suas faces, e os olhos estavam claros, plenamente acordados e atentos.
Estava sorrindo, e parecia que quase tudo ia bem com ele. Mas, aos olhos do mago, uma
leve mudança se operara, como se o envolvesse um toque de transparência, especialmente
notável na mão esquerda, que estava para fora do cobertor.
"Até isso deve esperar", disse Gandalf para si mesmo. "Ele ainda não está nem a meio
caminho da recuperação total, e como ficará no fim nem
#236
mesmo Elrond pode dizer. Nenhuma transformação para o mal, eu acho. Pode ser que se
transforme num vidro cheio de luz clara, para os olhos que puderem enxergar.- Sua aparência está esplêndida - disse ele em voz alta. - Vou arriscar uma história
curta sem consultar Elrond. Mas bem curta, veja bem, e então você deve dormir
de novo. Foi isto que aconteceu, pelo que pude entender: os Cavaleiros vieram direto na
sua direção, assim que você fugiu. Não precisavam mais dos cavalos como guias:
você tinha se tornado visível aos seus olhos, já estando no limiar do mundo deles. E
também o Anel os atraía. Seus amigos pularam de lado, para fora da estrada,
ou
teriam sido pisoteados pelos cavalos. Sabiam que nada poderia salvá-lo, se o cavalo
branco não pudesse fazê-lo. Os Cavaleiros eram rápidos demais para serem alcançados,
e estavam em número muito grande para serem enfrentados. A pé, nem mesmo Glorfindel e
Aragorn juntos poderiam resistir aos Nove de
uma vez.
- Quando os Espectros do Anel passaram, nossos amigos correram atrás deles. Perto do Vau
existe uma pequena reentrância ao lado da estrada, coberta por algumas árvores
raquíticas. Lá acenderam rapidamente uma fogueira, pois Glorfindel sabia que uma enchente
desceria, se os Cavaleiros tentassem atravessar, e então ele teria de lidar
com qualquer um que tivesse ficado do lado do rio onde estava. O momento da enchente
chegou; ele saiu correndo, seguido por Aragorn e os outros, com tochas flamejantes.
Presos entre fogo e água, e vendo o senhor élfico se revelar em sua ira, os Cavaleiros se
intimidaram, e os cavalos ficaram alucinados. Três foram levados pelo primeiro
assalto da enchente; os outros foram arremessados para dentro da água pelos próprios
cavalos, e vencidos.
- E este foi o fim dos Cavaleiros Negros? - perguntou Frodo.
- Não! - disse Gandalf. - Os cavalos devem ter sucumbido, e sem os animais os Cavaleiros
ficam aleijados. Mas os Espectros do Anel não são assim tão facilmente destruídos.

Entretanto, não há mais nada a temer por enquanto. Seus amigos atravessaram depois que a
enchente passou, e encontraram você deitado, com o rosto virado para baixo,
no topo da margem, e em cima de uma espada quebrada. O cavalo estava montando guarda ao
lado. Você estava pálido e frio; recearam que estivesse morto, ou coisa pior.
O pessoal de Elrond encontrou-os carregando-o lentamente até Valfenda.
- Quem fez a enchente? - perguntou Frodo.
- Elrond a comandou - respondeu Gandalf. - O rio sob este vale está sob seu domínio, e
pode se levantar em ira quando há uma grande necessidade de barrar o Vau.
Assim que o capitão dos Espectros do Anel cavalgou para dentro da água, a enchente foi
lançada. Se é que posso dizer isso, acrescentei uns toques próprios: você
pode não ter notado, mas algumas das ondas
#237
tomaram a forma de grandes cavalos brancos com cavaleiros brancos e brilhantes, e havia
muitas pedras que rolavam e se esfacelavam.
Por um
momento, pensei
termos liberado uma ira muito intensa, e que poderíamos perder o controle da enchente,
que os carregaria para longe. Existe uma grande força nas águas formadas pela
neve das Montanhas Sombrias.
- Sim, agora tudo volta a minha mente - disse Frodo. - O rugido tremendo. Pensei que
estivesse me afogando, com meus amigos, inimigos e tudo mais. Mas agora estamos
salvos!
Gandalf olhou rápido para Frodo, que agora fechara os olhos. - Sim, estão todos a salvo
por enquanto. Logo haverá uma festa e divertimento para comemorar a vitória
no Vau do Bruinen, e todos vocês estarão lá, em lugares de honra.
- Esplêndido! - disse Frodo. - É maravilhoso que Elrond, Glorfindel e esses grandes
senhores, para não mencionar Passolargo, prestem-se a tanto trabalho e demonstrem
tamanha gentileza.
- Bem, existem muitas razões para isso - disse Gandalf, sorrindo. Eu sou uma boa razão.
O Anel é outra: você é o Portador do Anel. E você é o herdeiro de Bilbo,
aquele que o encontrou.
- Meu querido Bilbo! - disse Frodo sonolento. - Pergunto-me onde estará. Gostaria que
estivesse aqui e pudesse saber de tudo que aconteceu. Iria rir de tudo. A
vaca pula pra Lua! E o pobre e velho troll! - Com isso, adormeceu profundamente.
Frodo agora estava a salvo, na última Casa Amiga a Leste do Mar. Essa casa era, como
Bilbo tinha dito muitas vezes, "uma casa perfeita, para quem gosta de comer
ou dormir, de contar histórias ou de cantar, ou apenas de se sentar e pensar nas coisas,
ou ainda para quem gosta de uma mistura agradável de tudo isso". A simples
estada ali representava uma cura para o cansaço, o medo ou a tristeza.
Quando a noite ia chegando, Frodo acordou de novo, e percebeu que não sentia mais
necessidade de dormir ou descansar, mas queria comida e bebida, e provavelmente
um pouco de cantoria e histórias depois. Saiu da cama e descobriu que quase podia usar o
braço como sempre fizera. Encontrou, estendidas à sua espera, roupas limpas
de tecido verde, que lhe caíam de modo perfeito. Olhando no espelho, assustou-se ao ver
uma imagem de si mesmo muito mais magra do que a que recordava: a imagem
era notavelmente parecida com aquela do jovem sobrinho de Bilbo, que costumava passear
com o tio no Condado, mas os olhos o observavam
pensativamente.
Sim, você viu uma ou duas coisas desde que espiou através de um espelho pela última vez disse ele para seu reflexo. - Mas, desta vez, o encontro foi feliz! - Espreguiçou-se
e assobiou uma melodia.
#238
Nesse momento, ouviu uma batida na porta, e Sam entrou. Correu em direção a Frodo e pegou
sua mão esquerda, desajeitado e tímido. Tocou-a suavemente, e depois corou,
virando-se depressa para o outro lado.

- Oi, Sam! - disse Frodo.
- Está quente! - disse Sam. - Quero dizer, sua mão, Sr. Frodo. Esteve fria durante as
longas noites. Mas soem as trombetas! - gritou ele, voltando-se de novo com
um brilho nos olhos, dançando pelo quarto. - É bom vêlo novo em folha outra vez, senhor!
Gandalf me pediu que viesse ver se já estava pronto para descer, e eu pensei
que ele estava brincando.
- Estou pronto - disse Frodo. - Vamos procurar o resto do grupo!
- Posso levá-lo até eles, senhor - disse Sam. - A casa é grande, e muito peculiar. Sempre
há mais alguma coisa para descobrir, e nunca se sabe o que está depois
da curva de um corredor. E elfos, senhor! Elfos aqui, elfos ali! Alguns parecidos com
reis, terríveis e esplêndidos; outros alegres como crianças. E a música e a
cantoria - não que eu tenha tido muito tempo ou ânimo para escutar desde que chegamos
aqui. Mas já estou começando a conhecer alguma coisa do lugar.
- Sei o que esteve fazendo, Sam - disse Frodo, pegando o braço do outro. - Mas hoje vai
se divertir, e ouvir música para alegrar seu coração. Venha! Leve-me pelos
corredores!
Sam o conduziu por vários corredores e desceram muitos degraus, chegando a um jardim alto
sobre a margem íngreme do rio. Frodo encontrou os amigos sentados num alpendre,
no lado da casa que dava para o Leste. Sombras já cobriam o vale lá embaixo, mas ainda
havia luz nas encostas das montanhas acima.
O ar estava quente. O som da água
correndo e caindo era alto, e a noite se enchia do aroma suave de árvores e flores, como
se o verão ainda permanecesse nos jardins de Elrond.
- Salve! - gritou Píppin, pulando de pé. - Aí vem nosso nobre primo! Abram alas para
Frodo, Senhor do Anel!
- Pssiu! - fez Gandalf, que estava entre as sombras na parte de trás do alpendre. Coisas maléficas não entram neste vale, mas mesmo assim não devemos nomeá-las.
O Senhor do Anel não é Frodo, mas o Senhor da Torre Escura de Mordor, cujo poder está de
novo se espalhando pelo mundo! Estamos numa fortaleza. Lá fora está ficando
escuro.
- Gandalf tem dito muitas coisas alegres como essa - disse Pippin. Acha que preciso me
comportar. Mas de certo modo parece impossível sentir-se triste ou deprimido
num lugar como este. Sinto que poderia cantar - se soubesse a canção certa para a
ocasião.
- Eu mesmo sinto vontade de cantar - riu Frodo. - Apesar de que agora sinto mais vontade
de comer e beber.
- Tudo isso vai ser sanado logo - disse Pippin. - Você está demonstrando sua costumeira
habilidade de acordar bem na hora da refeição!
#239
- Mais que refeição! Um banquete! - disse Merry -Assim que Gandalf contou que você estava
recuperado, os preparativos começaram. - Mal tinha acabado de falar, e
o badalar de muitos sinos chamou todos para o salão.
O salão da casa de Elrond estava cheio de pessoas: elfos na maioria, embora houvesse
alguns convidados diferentes. Elrond, como era de costume, sentou-se numa cadeira
grande na cabeceira de uma mesa comprida sobre o tablado; perto dele, de um lado sentouse Glorfindel, e do outro,
Gandalf.
Frodo olhou-os admirado, pois nunca tinha visto pessoalmente Elrond, celebrado em muitas
histórias. Sentados à direita e à esquerda, Glorfindel, e até mesmo Gandalf,
que julgava conhecer tão bem, revelaram-se senhores de dignidade e poder.
Gandalf era mais baixo que os outros dois, mas seus longos cabelos brancos, a vasta barba
prateada e os ombros largos conferiam-lhe a aparência de algum rei sábio
de antigas lendas. Em seu rosto envelhecido, adornado por grossas sobrancelhas brancas,
os olhos escuros pareciam ser feitos de carvão, prontos a se acender em chamas
a qualquer momento.

Glorfindel era alto e ereto; o cabelo de um dourado brilhante, o rosto belo e jovem,
temerário e cheio de alegria; os olhos eram brilhantes e agudos, a voz parecia
música; em sua fronte se alojava a sabedoria; na mão, a força.
O rosto de Elrond parecia eterno, nem velho nem jovem, embora nele se inscrevesse a
memória de muitas coisas, alegres e tristes. Os cabelos eram escuros como as
sombras da noite, e sobre a cabeça via-se um diadema de prata; os olhos eram cinzentos
como uma noite clara, e neles havia uma luz como a das estrelas. Parecia venerável,
como um rei coroado com muitos invernos, e ao mesmo tempo vigoroso como um guerreiro
experiente, no auge da força. Era o Senhor de Valfenda, poderoso entre elfos
e homens.
No meio da mesa, diante de tapeçarias tecidas penduradas na parede, havia uma cadeira sob
um dossel, e ali se sentava uma mulher bonita de se olhar, que era tão
parecida com Elrond em suas formas femininas que Frodo adivinhou que ela era uma parente
próxima dele. Era jovem, e ao mesmo tempo não era. As tranças de seu cabelo
escuro não tinham sido tocadas pela neve, e os braços brancos e o rosto claro eram
perfeitos e suaves, e a luz das estrelas estava em seus olhos brilhantes, cinzentos
como uma noite de céu limpo; apesar disso, parecia-se com uma rainha, e seu olhar era
cheio de ponderação e sabedoria, como o olhar de alguém que conhece muitas
coisas que os anos trazem. Na altura da fronte, a cabeça estava coberta com uma touca de
renda prateada, enredada com pequenas pedras, de um brilho branco; mas o
traje, de um cinza pálido, não tinha qualquer ornamento, a não ser um cinto de folhas
lavradas em prata.
Foi assim que Frodo viu aquela que poucos mortais viram: Arwen, a filha de Elrond,
através da qual, dizia-se, a figura de
Lúthien tinha voltado
#240
à terra de novo. E ela era chamada de Undómiel, pois era a Estrela Vespertina de seu
povo. Tinha permanecido muito tempo na terra dos parentes de sua mãe, em Lórien,
além das montanhas, e só recentemente retomara a Valfenda, à casa de seu pai. Mas os
irmãos, Elladan e Elrohir, estavam fora, vagando pelo mundo: freqüentemente
iam para longe com os guardiões do Norte, nunca se esquecendo do tormento de sua mãe nos
covis dos
orcs.
Frodo nunca tinha visto uma criatura tão adorável, nem imaginado em sua mente; ficou
surpreso e embaraçado ao ver que tinha um lugar reservado à mesa de Elrond,
entre todas essas pessoas, tão importantes e belas. Embora tivesse uma cadeira adequada,
e estivesse erguido por várias almofadas, sentiu-se muito pequeno, e fora
de lugar, mas esse sentimento logo passou. O banquete foi animado, e a comida, tudo o que
sua fome poderia desejar. Demorou um pouco até olhar em volta de novo,
ou simplesmente se virar para os vizinhos.
Primeiro, procurou os amigos. Sam implorara permissão para servir seu patrão, mas
disseram-lhe que dessa vez ele era um convidado de honra. Frodo agora podia vê-lo,
sentado com Pippin e Merry na extremidade de uma das mesas laterais, que ficava perto do
estrado. Mas não se via sinal de Passolargo.
À direita de Frodo estava um anão de aparência importante, luxuosamente vestido. A barba,
muito comprida e em forma de forquilha, era branca, quase tão branca
quanto o branco níveo de suas roupas. Usava um cinto de prata, e em volta do pescoço uma
corrente de prata com diamantes. Frodo parou de comer para olhá-lo.
- Bem-vindo seja! - disse o anão, virando-se na direção dele. Depois realmente levantouse da cadeira e fez uma reverência. - Glóin às suas ordens - disse ele, e
fez uma reverência ainda maior.
- Frodo Bolseiro, às suas ordens e de sua família - disse Frodo corretamente, levantandose surpreso e espalhando suas almofadas pelo chão. Estaria eu certo em supor
que o senhor é aquele Glóin, um dos doze companheiros do grande Thorin Escudo de
Carvalho?

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
- Perfeitamente certo - respondeu o anão, recolhendo as almofadas e educadamente ajudando
Frodo a se ajeitar de novo na cadeira. - E eu não pergunto, pois já me
disseram que você é o parente e herdeiro adotado de nosso amigo Bilbo, o renomado.
Permita-me felicitá-lo por sua recuperação.
- Muito obrigado - disse Frodo.
- Ouvi dizer que passou por estranhas aventuras - disse Glóin. - Tenho pensado muito no
motivo que traria quatro hobbits numa viagem tão longa. Nada assim aconteceu
desde que Bilbo veio conosco. Mas talvez eu não deva perguntar tantas coisas, uma vez que
Elrond e Gandalf não parecem dispostos a falar sobre o assunto.
#241
-Acho que não falaremos disso, pelo menos por enquanto - disse Frodo educadamente.
Percebeu que, mesmo na casa de Elrond, o assunto do Anel não era objeto de conversas
casuais; de qualquer modo, queria esquecer seus problemas por um tempo. - Mas estou
igualmente curioso - acrescentou ele - em saber o que traz um anão tão importante
a um lugar tão distante da Montanha Solitária.
Glóm olhou para ele. - Se não ouviu sobre isso, acho que também não falaremos do assunto
por enquanto. Mestre Elrond vai nos reunir a todos em breve, eu acredito,
e então ouviremos muitas coisas. Mas há muitas outras histórias que podem ser contadas.
Conversaram durante todo o resto do banquete, mas Frodo ouviu mais do que falou; as
notícias sobre o Condado, exceto pelo Anel, pareciam pequenas, distantes e sem
importância, enquanto Glóin tinha muito a contar sobre os acontecimentos da região Norte
das Terras Ermas. Frodo soube que Grimbeorn, o Velho, filho de Beorn, era
agora senhor de muitos homens vigorosos, e em suas terras, entre as Montanhas e a
Floresta das Trevas, nem
orcs nem lobos ousavam entrar.
- Na verdade - disse Glóin -, se não fosse pelos beomings, a passagem de Valle até
Valfenda teria há muito tempo se tornado impossível. São homens valorosos,
e mantêm aberto o Passo Alto e o Vau de Carrock. Mas cobram muito caro - acrescentou ele,
balançando a cabeça. - E, como
Beorn, o Velho, eles não morrem de amores pelos anões. Ainda assim, são confiáveis, o que
Já é muito nos
dias de hoje. Em nenhum outro lugar existem homens tão amigáveis conosco como os homens
de Valle.
São um povo bom, os bardings. O neto de Bard, o Arqueiro, os governa: Brand filho de
Bain, filho de Bard. É um rei forte, e seu reino agora alcança regiões ao
extremo Sul e Leste de Esgaroth.
- E o que tem a contar sobre seu próprio povo? - perguntou Frodo. -Há muito o que contar,
coisas boas e
-ruins - disse Glóin. - Mas a maioria é boa: até agora
tivemos sorte, mas não escapamos da sombra desta época. Se realmente deseja escutar sobre
nós, terei prazer em contar acontecimentos. Mas me interrompa quando ficar
cansado! As línguas dos anões não param quando falam de seus assuntos, como dizem por aí.
E, com isso, Glóin embarcou num longo relato dos feitos do Reinado dos Anões. Estava
deliciado por ter encontrado um ouvinte tão educado; Frodo não mostrava sinais
de cansaço, e não tentou mudar de assunto, embora na verdade tenha ficado bastante
perdido em meio àqueles nomes estranhos de pessoas e lugares de que nunca tinha
ouvido falar antes. Entretanto, ficou interessado ao ouvir que Dám ainda era rei sob a
Montanha, e estava agora velho (tendo ultrapassado seu ducentésimo qüinquagésimo
aniversário), sendo venerável e fabulosamente rico. Dos dez companheiros que tinham
sobrevivido
#242
à Batalha dos Cinco Exércitos, sete ainda estavam com ele: Dwalin, Glóm, Dori, Nori,
Bifúr, Bofur e Bombur. Bombur agora estava tão gordo que não podia sair
da cama sozinho, e precisava de cinco anões jovens para levantá-lo.
- E o que aconteceu com Balin, Ori e óin? - perguntou Frodo.

Uma sombra cobriu o rosto de Glóin. - Não sabemos - respondeu ele.
- Foi principalmente por causa de Balin que eu vim até aqui buscar o aconselhamento dos
que moram em Valfenda. Mas vamos falar de coisas mais alegres nesta noite.
Glóin começou então a falar dos trabalhos de seu povo, contando a Frodo sobre suas
grandes realizações em Valle e sob a Montanha. - Trabalhamos bem - disse ele.
Mas no trabalho com metal não podemos nos comparar a nossos pais, dos quais vários
segredos se perderam. Fazemos boas armaduras e espadas afiadas, mas não podemos
reproduzir malhas ou lâminas como aquelas feitas antes de o dragão chegar. Superamos os
dias antigos apenas na mineração e na construção. Você precisava ver os aquedutos
de Valle, Frodo, e as fontes e os lagos! Deveria ver as estradas pavimentadas com pedras
de várias cores! E os salões e ruas feitas em cavernas sob a terra, com
arcos entalhados como árvores; e os terraços e torres sobre as encostas da Montanha!
Então veria que não ficamos de braços cruzados!
- Irei até lá para ver tudo, se puder - disse Frodo. - Bilbo ficaria muito surpreso ao
saber das transformações na Desolação de Smaug.
Glóm olhou para Frodo e sorriu. - Você gostava muito de Bilbo, não é? - perguntou ele.
- Sim - respondeu Frodo. - Encontrá-lo de novo me traria mais alegria do que ver todas as
torres e palácios do mundo.
Finalmente o banquete chegou ao fim. Elrond e Arwen se levantaram e se afastaram pelo
salão, e o grupo os seguiu na devida ordem. As portas foram abertas, e todos
seguiram através de um corredor largo, passando por outras portas, chegando a um outro
salão. Nesse lugar não havia mesas, mas uma fogueira bem acesa queimava numa
grande lareira, em meio a dois pilares entalhados.
Frodo se viu andando ao lado de Gandalf - Este é o Salão do Fogo disse o mago. - Aqui
poderá escutar muitas canções e histórias - se conseguir ficar acordado. Mas,
a não ser em dias importantes, o salão fica vazio e quieto, e aqui vêm pessoas que
desejam ter paz e refletir.
O fogo fica sempre aceso, durante todo o ano, mas
quase não há outra fonte de luz.
Quando Elrond entrava e se encaminhava para o lugar preparado para ele, os menestréis
élficos começaram a executar uma música suave. Lentamente o salão se encheu,
e Frodo olhava com prazer os muitos rostos bonitos
#243
que se reuniam; a luz dourada do fogo brincava naquelas faces e dançava em seus cabelos.
De repente notou, num ponto não muito distante do lado oposto ao fogo,
uma pequena figura escura, sentada num banco, com as costas apoiadas num pilar. Ao seu
lado, no chão, estava uma taça de bebida e um pouco de pão. Frodo se perguntou
se estaria doente (se é que alguém ficava doente em Valfenda) e por isso não pudera
comparecer ao banquete. A cabeça parecia caída sobre o peito, num sono profundo,
e uma dobra da capa escura cobria-lhe o rosto.
Elrond foi na frente e parou diante da figura silenciosa. -Acorde, pequeno mestre! disse ele com um sorriso. Então, voltando-se, fez um sinal para Frodo. - Finalmente
é chegada a hora que você esperou com tanta ansiedade, Frodo - disse ele. - Aqui está o
amigo de quem sente tanta saudade. A figura escura levantou a cabeça, descobrindo
o rosto.
- Bilbo! - gritou Frodo, reconhecendo-o de repente, e pulando em direção a ele.
- Olá, Frodo, meu rapaz! - disse Bilbo. - Então finalmente chegou até aqui. Eu esperava
que conseguisse. Bem, bem! Então toda essa festa é em sua homenagem, pelo
que ouvi. Espero que tenha se divertido.
- Por que você não estava lá? - gritou Frodo. - E por que não me deixaram vê-lo antes?
- Porque você estava dormindo. Eu vi você muitas vezes. Fiquei ao seu lado todos os dias,
junto com Sam. Mas, quanto ao banquete, não costumo freqüentar eventos
desse tipo ultimamente. E eu tinha outra coisa para fazer.
- O que estava fazendo?

- Bem, estava sentado, pensando. Faço muito isso nos últimos tempos, e aqui é o melhor
lugar para fazê-lo, geralmente. - Acordar, hein? - disse ele, piscando um
olho para Elrond. Havia um brilho vivo naquele olhar, e nenhum sinal de sonolência ou
cansaço que Frodo pudesse ver. - Acordar! Eu não estava dormindo, Mestre Elrond.
E, se quiser saber, vocês todos saíram da festa muito cedo, e me atrapalharam... bem no
meio de uma canção que estava fazendo. Enrosquei em um ou dois versos, e
estava pensando neles; mas agora suponho que nunca mais vou conseguir compô-los direito.
Haverá tanta cantoria que as idéias serão varridas da minha mente. Terei
de pedir ao meu amigo, o Dúnadain, para me ajudar. Onde ele está?
Elrond riu. - Será encontrado - disse ele. - E daí você se recolhe num canto e termina a
tarefa, e então vamos
ouvi-la e julgá-la antes do fim de nossas comemorações.
- Mensageiros foram enviados para encontrar o amigo de Bilbo, embora ninguém soubesse
onde ele estava, e por que não tinha participado da festa.
Enquanto isso, Bilbo e Frodo sentaram-se lado a lado, e Sam veio logo para perto deles.
Conversaram em voz baixa, esquecidos da alegria e da
#244
música no salão ao redor. Bilbo não tinha muito a falar de si mesmo. Quando partiu da
Vila dos Hobbits, vagou sem destino, ao longo da Estrada, ou pelos campos que
a margeiam; mas de alguma forma tinha sempre se dirigido para Valfenda.
- Cheguei aqui sem muitas aventuras - disse ele. - Depois de um descanso, fui com os
anões até Valle: minha última viagem. Não devo viajar mais.
O velho Balin foi
embora. Depois voltei para cá, e aqui tenho permanecido. E, é claro, componho umas
canções. De vez em quando eles as cantam, só para me satisfazer, eu acho. Na verdade,
não estão à altura de Valfenda. E escuto e penso. O tempo parece não passar aqui: apenas
é. Somando tudo, um lugar notável.
- Aqui escuto todo tipo de notícia, de além das Montanhas, e do Sul, mas quase nada do
Condado. Ouvi sobre o Anel, é claro. Gandalf freqüentemente vem aqui. Não
que tenha me contado muita coisa, ficou mais reservado que nunca nestes últimos anos.
O Dúnadan me contou mais. Imagine, aquele meu anel causando tanta confusão!
É uma pena que Gandalf não tenha descoberto mais coisas antes, eu mesmo poderia ter
trazido o Anel há muito tempo, sem tantos problemas. Pensei várias vezes em voltar
para a Vila dos Hobbits para fazer isso; mas estou ficando velho, e eles não deixariam:
quero dizer, Gandalf e Elrond. Parece que eles achavam que o Inimigo estava
me procurando em toda parte, e faria picadinho de mim, se me pegasse cambaleando pelas
Terras Ermas.
- E Gandalf disse: "O Anel passou para outras mãos, Bilbo. Não seria bom, para você ou
para outros, tentar se meter com ele outra vez." Uma observação estranha,
bem ao estilo de Gandalf. Mas ele disse que estava cuidando de você, então deixei as
coisas acontecerem. Estou tremendamente feliz em vê-lo são e salvo. - Parou
e olhou para Frodo, desconfiado.
- Você está com ele? - perguntou num sussurro. - Não posso deixar de ficar curioso, você
sabe, depois de tudo que ouvi. Gostaria muito de apenas dar uma espiadinha
nele de novo.
- Sim, está comigo - respondeu Frodo, sentindo uma estranha relutância. O Anel é o mesmo de sempre.
- Gostaria de vê-lo só um segundo - disse Bilbo.
Quando se vestia, Frodo descobriu que, enquanto estivera dormindo, o Anel tinha sido
pendurado em seu pescoço numa nova corrente, leve mas forte. Lentamente o retirou.
Bilbo estendeu a mão. Mas Frodo rapidamente afastou o Anel. Para sua tristeza e espanto,
viu que não olhava mais para Bilbo; uma sombra parecia ter caído entre os
dois, e através dela Frodo passou a ver uma criatura pequena e enrugada, com um rosto
faminto e mãos ossudas e ávidas. Sentiu um desejo de bater nela.
A música e a cantoria ao redor pareceram sumir, e um silêncio caiu. Bilbo olhou rápido
para o rosto de Frodo, e passou a mão sobre seus olhos.

Entendo agora - disse ele. - Guarde-o! Sinto muito: sinto por você ter entrado nessa
história para carregar um fardo tão pesado: sinto por tudo. As aventuras nunca
acabam? Acho que não. Outra pessoa sempre tem de continuar a história. Bem, isso não pode
ser evitado. Penso se adianta alguma coisa eu tentar terminar meu livro.
Mas não vamos nos preocupar com isso agora... passemos para algumas Notícias de verdade.
Conte-me tudo sobre o Condado!
Frodo escondeu o Anel, e a sombra passou, mal deixando um leve traço de memória. A luz e
a música de Valfenda o envolviam de novo. Bilbo sorriu e deu alegres gargalhadas.
Todos os itens das notícias sobre o Condado que Frodo pôde contar - ajudado e corrigido
de vez em quando por Sam
- eram de seu maior interesse, desde a derrubada da menor árvore, até as travessuras da
criança mais jovem da Vila dos Hobbits. Estavam tão envolvidos com os acontecimentos
das Quatro Quartas que nem perceberam a chegada de um homem vestido de verde-escuro. Por
vários minutos, ficou olhando para baixo em direção a eles, com um sorriso.
De repente, Bilbo olhou para cima. - Ah! finalmente você está aí, Dúnadan! - gritou ele.
Passolargo! - disse Frodo. - Parece que você tem um monte de nomes. Bem, Passolargo é um
que nunca escutei - disse Bilbo. - Por que o chama assim?
- Chamam-me desse modo em Bri - disse Passolargo rindo. - E foi assim que fui apresentado
a ele.
E por que você o chama de Dúnadan? - perguntou Frodo.
O Dúnadan - disse Bilbo. - Sempre o chamam por esse nome aqui. Mas pensei que soubesse a
língua élfica o suficiente para conhecer a expressão dún-adan: homem do
Oeste, de Númenon Mas este não é o momento para aulas? - Voltou-se para Passolargo -:
Onde esteve, meu amigo" Por que não participou do banquete? A Senhora Arwen
estava lá.
Passolargo olhou para Bilbo com um ar sério. - Eu sei - disse ele. Mas sempre preciso
colocar a diversão de lado. Elladan e Elroffir retornaram das Terras Ermas
sem ser esperados e tinham novidades que eu queria ouvir imediatamente.
- Bem, meu querido companheiro - disse Bilbo. -Agora que ouviu as notícias, não pode me
ceder uns minutos? Quero sua ajuda numa coisa urgente. Elrond disse que essa
minha canção precisa ser terminada antes do fim da noite, e eu me enrosquei num pedaço.
Vamos até um cantinho, para dar os retoques finais.
Passolargo sorriu. - Então venha, deixe-me ouvi-la!
#246
Frodo ficou sozinho por uns momentos, pois Sam tinha adormecido. Estava solitário e se
sentia bastante abandonado, embora em sua volta o pessoal de Valfenda estivesse
reunido. Mas as pessoas próximas a ele estavam em silêncio, prestando atenção à música
das vozes e dos instrumentos, e não se davam conta de mais nada. Frodo começou
a escutar.
Num primeiro momento, a beleza das melodias e das palavras misturadas nas línguas
élficas, embora pudesse entendê-las bem pouco, envolveram-no numa espécie de encanto,
logo que começou a prestar atenção nelas. Parecia quase que as palavras tomavam forma, e
visões de terras distantes e de coisas brilhantes que ele nunca sequer imaginara
se abriram diante dele; o salão iluminado pela fogueira se tornou semelhante a uma névoa
dourada sobre mares de espuma que suspiravam sobre as margens do mundo.
Então, o encantamento ficou cada vez mais semelhante a um sonho, até que Frodo sentiu que
um rio interminável de ouro e prata passava por ele, múltiplo demais para
ser compreendido; tornara-se parte do ar que pulsava ao redor, e o encharcava e afogava.
Rapidamente afundou sob aquele peso brilhante, entrando num mundo profundo
de sonho.
Ali vagou por muito tempo num sonho de música que se transformava em água corrente, e
depois, de súbito, numa voz. Parecia ser a voz de Bilbo cantando versos. Indistinta
no início, mas depois as palavras corriam nítidas.

Edrendil foi um marinheiro que veio em Arvernien morar:
cortou madeira de Nimbrethil, fez um navio para viajar; teceu as velas com fios de prata,
também de prata é a iluminação; qual cisne a proa foi esculpida, e a luz
dá vida a seu pavilhão.
Com armadura de antigos reis,
malha de anéis, qual manto real,
broquel brilhante de runas cheio, vai protegê-lo de todo mal;
pro arco um chifre deu-lhe um dragão, de ébano bom as flechas que tinha;
defio de prata era o gibão, de calcedônia era a bainha;
valente espada de açofino, e adamantino elmo o respalda;
pena de águia traz por enfeite, e sobre o peito linda esmeralda.
#247
Sob o luar e sob as estrelas,
viajava pelas praias do Norte;
como encantado, confuso ia além dos dias da terra da morte
Quer do rangido do Gelo Estreito,
das sombras
leito em campo gelado,
quer do calor e da lava ardente,
rápido sempre saía por um lado; por águas negras longe trafega,
até que navega em Noite do Nada e vai passando sem encontrar praia brilhante ou luz
desejada.
Vêm procurá-lo os ventos da ira
e cego gira em mar sem promessa;
de Oeste a Leste, tudo impreciso, e sem aviso à casa regressa.
Voando chega até ele Elwing e há chama enfim na treva a queimar;
mais que diamante brilha e resplende o fogo ardente de seu colar
Com a Silmaril ela o ataviou e o coroou com a luz vivente;
sem medo então, com fogo no olhar, vai navegar;
e na noite quente lá do Outromundo além do Mar surge o troar deforte tormenta em
Tarmenel,
um vento poder; por rota incerta,
rara e agourenta, leva seu barco num sopro mordaz,
poderferoz de morte no ar
e mares tristes e abandonados de lado a lado ele viu passar.
Por Noiteterna reconduzido,
em atro estampido de ondas que vão por mar sem luz
de costas profundas mortas nofundo desde a criação;
foi lá que ouviu em praias de pérolas, onde da terra a música cessa,
onde na espuma há ondas rolando de ouro amarelo ejóias à beça.
#248

Viu a Montanha subindo calada,
na tarde sentada sobre os joelhos de Valinor,
enquanto Eldamar olhava o mar além dos escolhos.
Errante em fuga da noite sai e a um porto vai enfim atracar;
na Casadelfos verde e bonita,
o ar palpita e,
cor de luar, sob a Colina de Jlmarin,
brilham num vale diafanizadas,
iluminadas torres de Tírion no Lago Sombra sempre espelhadas.

Lá descansou das duras andanças,
música e dança por lá aprendeu,
mil maravilhas foram contadas e harpas douradas alguém lhe deu.
De branco élfico foi revestido e, precedido por luzes sete,
passando por Calacirian na terra arcana e vazia se mete.
Viu salões imemoriais com os anais de anos sem conta,
do Antigo Rei viu reinos sem fim em Ilmarin do Monte na ponta;
novas palavras então aprende de homens grandes e elfos matreiros,
além do mundo onde há visões que só se expõem aosforasteiros.
Foi construido novo navio todo mithril e aí cristalino,
proa brilhante, mas ninguém rema ou vela treme em mastro argentino:
a Silmaril, sua única luz, que ele conduz qualflâmula em chama para brilharjunto a
Elbereth
que reaparece e logo derrama imortais asas para o transporte,
traça-lhe a sorte sempre sua, zarpar por céus sem litoral
por trás do Sol e da luz da Lua.
#249
Das Sempriguais, colinas pacatas,
onde cascatas tecem sua rede,
levam-no as asas,
farol errante,
além do grande Monte Parede.
Do Fim-do-Mundo ele desvia
e gostaria de achar a trilha do lar.
por entre sombras vagando,
sempre queimando qual astro em ilha sobrevoando a névoa ele vem,
chama do além que ao Sol é clarão,
é maravilha de um novo dia onde águas cinza do Norte vão.
Por sobre a Terra-média passou e ali soou a voz de quem chora,
donzelas élficas e mulheres dos Dias Antigos, de anos de outrora.
Mas sobre si levava sua sorte,
da Lua até a morte,
estrela fadada a ir queimando sem se deter para rever sua terra amada;
pra todo o sempre nesta missão, sem que descanso tenha à ftente,
longe levar da lâmpada aflama qual Porta-chama do Ponente.
O canto parou. Frodo abriu os olhos e viu que Bilbo estava sentado em seu banco, em meio
a um círculo de ouvintes, que sorriam e aplaudiam.
- Agora é melhor escutarmos de novo - disse um elfo.
Bilbo se levantou, fazendo uma reverência. - Estou lisonjeado, Lindir
- disse ele. - Mas seria muito cansativo repetir tudo.
- Não cansativo demais para você - responderam os elfos, rindo. Sabemos que nunca se
cansa de repetir seus próprios versos. Mas, falando serio, não podemos responder
sua pergunta ouvindo só uma vez!
- O quê? - gritou Bilbo. - Vocês não sabem que partes são minhas, e quais sãos as do
Dúnadan?
Não é fácil diferenciar entre dois mortais - disse o elfo.
Bobagem, Lindir - retrucou Bilbo. - Se você não consegue fazer distinção entre um homem e
um hobbit, então seu discernimento é mais pobre do que eu imaginava. São
diferentes como ervilhas e maçãs.
- Talvez. Para uma ovelha, as outras ovelhas são diferentes - riu Lindir. - Ou para os
pastores. Mas os mortais não são objeto de nosso estudo. Temos outras preocupações.

- Não vou discutir com você - disse Bilbo. - Estou com sono depois de tanta música e
cantoria. Vou deixar que adivinhem, se quiserem.
Levantou-se e veio em direção a Frodo. - Bem, terminou - disse ele em voz baixa. - Saiu
melhor do que eu imaginava. Não é sempre que me pedem para cantar de novo.
O que achou?
- Não vou tentar adivinhar - disse Frodo sorrindo.
- Não precisa - disse Bilbo. - Na verdade, a canção é toda minha. Exceto pela insistência
de Aragorn em colocar uma pedra verde. Parece que ele achava importante.
Não sei por quê. Por outro lado, ele obviamente considerou toda a coisa acima de minhas
capacidades, e disse que se eu tinha o topete de fazer versos sobre Eãrendil
na casa de Elrond, o problema era meu. Acho que estava certo.
- Não sei - disse Frodo. - Pareceu-me adequado, de alguma forma, embora não consiga
explicar. Estava meio adormecido quando começou, e parecia que os versos fluíam
de algum elemento que fazia parte dos meus sonhos. Só no final percebi que era realmente
você falando.
- É dificil permanecer acordado aqui, até que se acostume - disse Bilbo. - Não que eu
ache que os hobbits possam jamais adquirir o apetite que os elfos têm pela
música, pela poesia e pelas histórias. Parece que gostam dessas coisas tanto quanto de
comida, ou mais. Ainda vão continuar por um longo tempo. Que acha de sairmos
de fininho, para ter uma conversa mais reservada?
- Podemos fazer isso?
- Claro! Isto aqui é diversão, não coisa séria. Vá e venha como bem entender, contanto
que não faça barulho.
Levantaram-se e se retiraram em silêncio para as sombras. Deixaram Sam para trás,
profundamente adormecido e ainda com um sorriso nos lábios. Apesar do prazer da
companhia de Bilbo, Frodo sentiu uma ponta de pesar por não permanecer no Salão do Fogo.
No momento em que saíam da sala, uma única voz limpa se levantou, cantando.
A Elbereth Gilthoniel, silivren penna míriel
o menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-díriel
o galadhremmin ennorath, Fanuilos, le linnathon nef aear. sí nef aearon!
Frodo parou por um momento, olhando para trás. Elrond estava em sua cadeira, e o fogo
brilhava em seu rosto como a luz do sol sobre as árvores.
#251
perto dele estava sentada a Senhora Arwen. Para sua surpresa, Frodo viu que Aragorn
estava ao lado dela; sua escura capa estava jogada para trás, e parecia vestido
numa malha élfica, com uma estrela brilhando em seu peito. os dois conversavam, e de
repente pareceu a Frodo que Arwen virou-se na sua direção, e a luz daqueles
olhos caiu sobre ele, e, mesmo vindo de longe, penetrou seu coração.
Parou ainda encantado, enquanto as sílabas doces da canção élfica caíam como jóias
cristalinas, numa fusão de palavra e melodia. - É uma canção para Elbereth - disse
Bilbo. - Cantarão esta, e muitas outras canções do Reino Abençoado, muitas vezes esta
noite. Venha!
Levou Frodo de volta até seu próprio quarto, que se abria para os jardins e dava para o
Sul, através do desfiladeiro do Bruinen. Ali ficaram sentados por um tempo,
olhando pela janela as claras estrelas, sobre as florestas nas encostas íngremes, e
conversaram em voz baixa. Não falaram mais das pequenas coisas do Condado lá
longe, nem das sombras escuras e dos perigos que os ameaçavam, mas das belas coisas que
juntos tinham visto pelo mundo, dos elfos, das estrelas e do outono suave
daquele brilhante ano nas florestas.
Finalmente ouviu-se uma batida na porta. - Com sua licença, senhor
- disse Sam, colocando para dentro a cabeça. - Estava pensando se precisavam de alguma
coisa.
- Também peço licença, Sam Gamgi - respondeu Bilbo. - Acho que sua intenção é dizer que
está na hora de seu patrão ir para a cama.

- Bem, senhor, haverá um Conselho amanhã cedo, pelo que ouvi, e hoje foi a primeira vez
que ele se levantou.
- Certíssimo, Sam - riu Bilbo. - Você pode ir correndo dizer a Gandalf que Frodo já foi
dormir. Boa noite, Frodo! Puxa vida, como foi bom vê-lo outra vez. No final
das contas, não há pessoas que se comparem aos hobbits numa boa conversa. Estou ficando
muito velho, e começo a pensar se viverei para ler os seus capítulos da nossa
história. Boa noite! Acho que vou fazer uma caminhada, e olhar as estrelas de Elbereth no
jardim. Durma bem!

#252
CAPíTULO II
O CONSELHO DE ELROND

#253
No dia seguinte, Frodo acordou cedo, sentindo-se bem e descansado. Caminhou ao longo dos
terraços debruçados sobre as águas ruidosas do Bruinen, e assistiu ao sol
pálido, fresco, erguer-se acima das montanhas distantes e emitir sobre o mundo seus
raios, que se inclinavam através da fina névoa de prata; o orvalho luzia nas
folhas amareladas, e teias entrelaçadas cintilavam em todos os arbustos. Sam ia ao lado
dele, sem dizer nada, mas apreciando o ar, e olhando uma vez ou outra para
as altas montanhas do Leste, com uma expressão maravilhada nos olhos. A neve era branca
sobre os picos.
Num assento talhado na pedra ao lado de uma curva do caminho, encontraram Gandalf e Bilbo
numa conversa compenetrada. - Olá! Bom dia!
- disse Bilbo. - Sente-se preparado para o grande Conselho?
Sinto-me preparado para qualquer coisa - respondeu Frodo. - Mas a coisa que eu mais
queria era fazer hoje uma caminhada para explorar o vale. Gostaria de entrar
naquelas florestas de pinheiros lá em cima. - Apontou para uma encosta muito distante,
bem acima de Valfenda, ao Norte.
Você pode ter uma oportunidade mais tarde - disse Gandalf - Mas ainda não podemos fazer
nenhum plano. Há muitas coisas para ouvir e decidir hoje.
De repente, enquanto conversavam, um sino tocou. - Esse é o sino de chamada para o
Conselho de Elrond - disse Gandalf - Venham agora! Tanto você quanto Bilbo foram
requisitados.
Frodo e Bilbo seguiram o mago rapidamente ao longo do caminho cheio de curvas, de volta
para a casa; atrás deles, não convidado e pelo momento esquecido, ia Sam.
Gandalf os conduziu até o alpendre onde Frodo tinha encontrado os amigos na noite
anterior. A luz da clara manhã de outono brilhava agora no vale.
O ruído das águas
borbulhantes vinha do leito espumante do rio. Pássaros cantavam, e uma paz benfazeja se
deitava sobre a terra. Para Frodo, sua fuga perigosa e os rumores da escuridão
crescendo no mundo lá fora já pareciam apenas lembranças de um sonho ruim; mas os rostos
que se voltaram para eles quando entraram estavam sérios.
Elrond estava ali, e muitos outros se sentavam em silêncio em torno dele. Frodo viu
Glorfindel e Glóin, e num canto, sozinho, estava PassolargO, vestido outra vez
em suas surradas roupas de viagem. Elrond chamou Frodo para se sentar ao seu lado, e o
apresentou ao grupo, dizendo:
#254
-Aqui, meus amigos, está o hobbit, Frodo, filho de Drogo. Poucos chegaram aqui, passando
por perigos maiores, ou em missão mais urgente.

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Então apontou e nomeou aqueles que Frodo ainda não tinha encontrado. Havia um anão mais
jovem ao lado de Glóin: seu filho
Gimli. Ao lado de Glorfindel estavam vários
outros conselheiros da casa de Elrond, de quem Erestor era o chefe; com ele estava
Galdor, um elfo dos Portos Cinzentos, que tinha vindo numa missão a pedido de
Círdan, o fabricante de embarcações. Havia também um elfo estranho, vestido de verde e
marrom, Legolas, mensageiro de seu pai, Thranduil, o Rei dos Elfos do Norte
da Floresta das Trevas. E, sentado um pouco à parte, estava um homem de rosto belo e
nobre, de cabelos escuros e olhos cinzentos, altivo e de olhar severo.
Estava com capa e botas, como se fosse fazer uma viagem a cavalo; na verdade, apesar de
suas vestes serem luxuosas, e a capa revestida de pele, estavam manchadas
por uma longa viagem. Tinha um colar de prata no qual havia uma única pedra; os cabelos
cacheados estavam cortados à altura dos ombros. Num cinturão, trazia uma
grande corneta com ornatos de prata, que agora colocara sobre os joelhos. Olhou para
Frodo e Bilbo com súbita surpresa.
- Aqui - disse Elrond, voltando-se para Gandalf -, aqui está Boromir, um homem do Sul.
Chegou no início da manhã, e procura aconselhamento. Pedi a ele que estivesse
presente, pois aqui as perguntas que tem a fazer serão respondidas.
Nem tudo o que foi falado e debatido no Conselho precisa ser contado aqui. Muito se falou
a respeito dos acontecimentos no mundo lá fora, especialmente no Sul, e
nas amplas regiões a Leste das Montanhas. Dessas coisas, Frodo já tinha escutado muitos
rumores; mas a história de Glóin era nova para ele, e quando o anão falou,
escutou com atenção. Parecia que em meio ao esplendor de seus trabalhos manuais, os
coraçoes dos anões da Montanha Solitária estavam preocupados.
-Agorajá faz muitos anos - disse Glóin -, que uma sombra de inquietude caiu sobre nosso
povo. De onde vinha, não percebemos a princípio. As palavras começaram a
ser sussurradas em segredo: dizia-se que estávamos presos num lugar pequeno, e que
riquezas e esplendores maiores seriam encontrados num mundo mais vasto. Alguns
falavam de Moria: as grandes construções de nossos pais, que em nossa língua são chamadas
de Khazaddúm; e declarava-se que agora, finalmente, tínhamos a força e
o número de pessoas para retornar.
Glóin suspirou. - Moria! Moria! Maravilha do Mundo do Norte. Cavamos muito fundo ali, e
acordamos o medo inominável. Por muito tempo, aquelas vastas mansões tinham
permanecido vazias, desde que os filhos de
#255
Durin fugiram. Mas agora falávamos de tudo aquilo com saudade outra vez e, apesar disso,
com medo. Nenhum anão tinha ousado ultrapassar as portas de Khazad-dúm durante
a vida de vários reis, a não ser Thrór, e ele pereceu. Finalmente, entretanto, Balin
escutou os rumores e resolveu ir; e embora Dáin relutasse em consenti-lo, Balin
levou consigo Ori e óin, e muitos outros de nosso povo, rumando para o Sul.
- isso foi há mais de trinta anos. Por um tempo, tivemos notícias e tudo parecia bem:
mensagens contavam que eles haviam entrado em Moria, e uma grande obra começava
lá. Depois, fez-se silêncio, e nenhuma palavra veio de Moria desde então.
- Depois, cerca de um ano atrás, um mensageiro veio até Dáin, mas não de Moria... de
Mordor: um cavaleiro chegou à noite, chamando Dáin até o portão.
O Senhor Sauron,
o Grande, dizia ele, desejava nossa amizade. Em troca daria anéis, assim como tinha dado
aos antigos. E o mensageiro queria muito saber a respeito de hobbits, de
como eles eram, e onde moravam. "Pois Sauron sabe", dizia ele, "que um deles foi
conhecido de vocês em certa época."
- Ao ouvirmos isso, ficamos muito preocupados, e não demos resposta, E então sua voz
maléfica ficou mais baixa, e ele a teria suavizado, se pudesse. "Apenas como
um pequeno sinal de sua amizade, Sauron pede isto", disse ele: "que encontrem esse
ladrão", foi essa a palavra que usou, e consigam dele, quer queira ou não,
um pequeno anel, o mais ínfimo dos anéis, que certa vez ele roubou. É um capricho de
Sauron, e uma prova da boa vontade de vocês. Encontrem-no, e três anéis que

os anões antepassados usaram lhes serão devolvidos, e poderão tomar posse de Moria para
sempre. Encontrem apenas notícias do ladrão, se ainda está vivo e onde, e
terão grande recompensa e a eterna amizade do Senhor. Recusem a oferta, e as coisas não
vão ficar muito bem. Recusam-se?"
Com isso sentimos seu hálito, semelhante ao silvo das serpentes, e todos os que estavam
ali tremeram, mas Dáin disse: "Não digo sim nem não. Preciso pensar na mensagem,
e no que está por trás desse belo disfarce."
- "Pense bem, mas não por muito tempo", disse ele.
- "Levo o tempo que precisar com meu pensamento", respondeu Dám.
- "Por enquanto", disse ele, e cavalgou para dentro da escuridão.
- Os corações de nossos líderes ficaram pesados desde aquela noite. Não precisávamos da
voz maligna do mensageiro para nos avisar que as palavras dele continham
ameaça e engano, pois já sabíamos que o poder que outra vez invadira Mordor não tinha
mudado, e que esse poder sempre havia nos traído outrora.
O mensageiro voltou
duas vezes, e se foi sem resposta. "A terceira e última vez", dizia ele, "está por
chegar, antes do fim do ano."
#256
- E então fui enviado finalmente por Dáin, para avisar Bilbo que ele está na mira do
Inimigo, e para saber, se for possível, por que ele deseja esse anel, o mais
ínfimo dos anéis. Também pedimos o conselho de Elrond. Pois a Sombra cresce e se
aproxima. Descobrimos que os mensageiros também foram enviados ao rei Brand, em
Valle, e que ele está com medo. Tememos que possa ceder. A guerra já está se formando na
fronteira Leste. Se não dermos resposta, o Inimigo poderá enviar os homens
sob seu comando para atacar o rei Brand, e também Dáin.
- Fez bem em ter vindo - disse Elrond. - Hoje você ouvirá tudo o que precisa para
entender os propósitos do Inimigo. Não há nada que possa fazer, a não ser resistir,
com ou sem esperança. Mas você não está só. Saberá que seu problema é apenas parte do
problema de todo o mundo ocidental. O Anel! Que devemos fazer com o Anel, o
mais ínfimo dos anéis, a ninharia que Sauron cobiça? É isso que devemos considerar.
- Este é o propósito de todos terem sido chamados aqui. Chamados, eu digo, embora eu não
tenha chamado vocês até mim, estrangeiros de terras distantes. Vocês vieram
e estão aqui reunidos, neste exato momento, por acaso, como pode parecer. Mas não é
assim. Acreditem que foi ordenado que nós, que estamos aqui sentados, e ninguém
mais, encontremos uma solução para o perigo do mundo.
-Agora, portanto, as coisas que foram até este dia ocultadas de todos, por alguns, devem
ser mencionadas abertamente. E começando, para que todos possam entender
qual é o perigo, a História do Anel será contada desde o início até o momento presente. E
eu devo começar, embora outros possam terminá-la.
Então todos escutaram, enquanto Elrond, com sua voz clara, falava de Sauron e dos Anéis
de Poder, e de sua forjadura na Segunda Era do mundo, há muito tempo. Uma
parte da história era conhecida por alguns ali, mas a história completa ninguém conhecia,
e muitos olhos se voltavam para Elrond com medo e surpresa, enquanto ele
contava sobre os ourives élficos de Eregion, e de sua amizade com Moria, e de sua avidez
de conhecimento, através da qual Sauron os seduziu. Pois, naquela época,
ainda não era declaradamente mau, e eles aceitaram sua ajuda, tornando-se hábeis,
enquanto Sauron aprendia todos os segredos, e os traía, forjando secretamente,
na Montanha do Fogo, o Um Anel para dominar todos os outros. Mas Celebrimbor sabia das
verdadeiras intenções de Sauron, e escondeu os Três que tinha feito; então
houve guerra, e a terra foi arrasada, e o portão de Moria foi fechado.
Depois disso, através de todos os anos que se seguiram, Sauron procurou o Anel; mas já
que essa história é recontada em outro lugar, pois o

próprio Elrond a registrou em seus livros de estudo, não será recordada aqui. Pois é uma
longa história, cheia de feitos grandiosos e terríveis, e embora Elrond
falasse de modo breve, o sol subiu no céu, e a manhã já estava no fim quando ele
terminou.
Falou de Númenor, de sua glória e queda, e do retorno dos Reis dos Homens à Terra-média,
vindos das profundezas do mar, carregados pelas asas da tempestade. Então
Elendil, o Alto, e seus poderosos filhos, Isildur e Anárion, tornaram-se grandes
senhores, e fundaram o Reino do Norte em Amor, e o Reino do Sul em Gondor, sobre
a foz do Anduin. Mas Sauron de Mordor os atacou, e eles fizeram a última Aliança de Elfos
e Homens, e as tropas de Gil-galad e Elendil foram reunidas em Amor.
Nesse momento, Elrond parou um pouco e suspirou. - Lembro-me bem do esplendor de suas
flâmulas - disse ele. - Fazia-me recordar da glória dos Dias Antigos e das
tropas de Beleriand, nas quais tantos príncipes importantes e capitães foram reunidos. E,
mesmo assim, nem tantos, e nem tão belos como na ocasião em que Thangorodrim
foi quebrada, e os elfos pensaram que o mal tinha acabado para sempre; mas isso não era
verdade.
- O senhor se lembra? - disse Frodo, pensando alto em sua surpresa. - Mas eu pensei gaguejou, no momento em que Elrond se voltava para ele -, pensei que a queda
de Gil-galad tinha sido há muito tempo.
- E de fato foi - respondeu Elrond com gravidade. - Mas minha memória alcança até os Dias
Antigos. Eãrendil foi meu pai, e nasceu em Gondolin antes da queda; e minha
mãe era Elwing, filha de Dior, filho de Lúthien de Dorialfi. Já vi três eras do Oeste do
Mundo, e muitas derrotas, e muitas vitórias infrutíferas.
- Fui o arauto de Gil-galad, e marchei com sua tropa. Estive na Batalha de Dagorlad
diante do Portão Negro de Mordor, onde vencemos: pois à Lança de Gil-galad, e
à Espada de Elendil, Aiglos e Narsil, ninguém podia resistir. Eu vi o último combate nas
encostas de Orodruíri, onde Gilgalad morreu, e Elendil caiu, e Narsil se
quebrou sob seu corpo. Mas Sauron foi vencido, e Isildur cortou o Anel de sua mão com o
fragmento do punho da espada do pai, e pegou-o para si.
Ao ouvir isso, o estrangeiro, Boromir, interrompeu-o. - Então foi isso que aconteceu com
o Anel! - gritou ele. - Se alguma vez essa história foi contada no Sul,
já foi há muito esquecida. Ouvi falar do Grande Anel daquele que não nomeamos, mas
acreditávamos que tinha desaparecido do mundo nas ruínas do primeiro reinado.
Isildur o pegou! Isso realmente é novidade.
- Infelizmente, sim - disse Elrond. - Isildur o pegou, e isso não deveria ter acontecido.
O Anel deveria ter sidojogado no fogo de Orodruin, exatamente onde foi
confeccionado. Mas poucos perceberam o que Isildur fez. Ele tinha ficado sozinho ao lado
do pai no confronto final; e ao lado de Gil-galad aperias Círdan ficou,
e eu. Mas Isildur não deu ouvidos ao nosso conselho.
#258
- "Levo isto como compensação pela morte de meu pai e de meu irmão", disse ele; portanto,
sem se importar com o que pensávamos, tomou o Anel para guardá-lo. Mas
logo foi traído por ele, o que causou sua morte; por isso é chamado no Norte de A Ruína
de Isildur. Mesmo assim, a morte ainda foi melhor do que aquilo que poderia
ter-lhe acontecido.
- Essas informações só vieram para o Norte, e apenas para alguns. Não é de admirar que
você não saiba de nada, Boromir. Da ruína dos Campos de Lis, onde Isildur
sucumbiu, apenas três homens voltaram pelas montanhas, depois de muito vagarem. Um destes
foi Olitar, o escudeiro de Isildur, que trazia os pedaços da espada de
Elendil; e ele os trouxe para Valandil, herdeiro de Isildur, que, por ser apenas uma
criança, tinha ficado aqui em Valfenda. Mas Narsil estava quebrada e sua luz
se extinguira, e ainda não tinha sido forjada novamente.
- Chamei de infrutífera a vitória da última Aliança? Não inteiramente, embora não tenha
alcançado seus objetivos.
O poder de Sauron diminuiu, mas não foi destruido.

O Anel estava perdido, mas não desfeito. A Torre Escura foi quebrada, mas os alicerces
não foram removidos, pois haviam sido feitos com o poder do Anel, e enquanto
este permanecer os alicerces vão durar. Muitos elfos e muitos homens poderosos, e muitos
de seus amigos, morreram na guerra. Anárion foi morto, e Isildur foi morto;
Gil-galad e Elendil não existiam mais. Nunca mais haverá uma aliança semelhante entre
homens e elfos, pois os homens se multiplicam, e os Primogênitos estão se extinguindo,
e os dois povos estão ficando cada vez mais distantes. E desde aquele dia, a raça de
Númenor vem decaindo, e o tempo que vivem diminui.
- No Norte, depois da guerra e do massacre dos Campos de Lis, os homens do Ponente
diminuíram em número, e sua cidade de
Annúminas ao lado do lago Vesperturvo ficou
em ruínas; os herdeiros de Valandil se mudaram e foram morar em Fornost, nas altas
Colinas do Norte, e essa também é uma região desolada atualmente. Os homens a
chamam de Fosso dos Mortos, e temem pisá-lo. O povo de Arnor diminuiu, e foi devorado
pelos inimigos, e seu reinado passou, deixando apenas túmulos verdes nas colinas
cobertas de capim.
- No Sul, o Reinado de Gondor durou muito tempo; por um período seu esplendor cresceu,
lembrando de alguma forma a força de Númenor, antes de cair. Altas torres
aquele povo construiu, e lugares resistentes, e portos de muitos navios, e a coroa alada
dos Reis dos Homens era respeitada e temida por povos de várias línguas.
A cidade principal era Osgiliath, Cidadela das Estrelas, no meio da qual o rio corria. E
construíram Minas Ithil, a Torre da Lua Nascente, do lado Leste, sobre uma
saliência das Montanhas da Sombra; a Oeste, aos pés das Montanhas Brancas, construíram
Minas Anor, a Torre
#259
do Sol Poente. Ali, nos pátios do Rei nasceu uma árvore branca, da semente que Isildur
trouxe através das águas profundas, e a semente dessa árvore tinha antes vindo
de Eressêa, e antes ainda do Extremo Oeste, no Dia antes dos dias quando o mundo era
jovem.
- Mas com o rápido passar dos anos na Terra-média a linhagem de Meneldil, filho de
Anárion, acabou, e a Árvore enfraqueceu, e o sangue dos habitantes de Númenor
se misturou com o de homens menores. Então, a guarda sobre as muralhas de Mordor
adormeceu, e seres escuros se esgueiraram de volta para Gorgoroth. E em certa época
seres maléficos avançaram, tomando Minas Ithil e ali permanecendo, transformando-a num
lugar de terror; agora é chamada de Minas Morgul, a Torre da Bruxaria. Então
Minas Anor foi chamada por outro nome, Minas Tirith, a Torre da Guarda; essas duas
cidades estavam sempre em guerra, mas Osgiliath, que ficava no meio delas, foi
abandonada e nas suas ruínas as sombras andavam.
- Foi assim por multas vidas de homens. Mas os Senhores de Minas Tirith ainda lutam,
desafiando nossos inimigos, mantendo a passagem do Rio desde Argonath até o
Mar. E agora a parte da história que devo contar chega a um fim. Pois nos dias de Isildur
o Anel Governante sumiu de todo o conhecimento, e os Três foram libertados
do seu domínio. Mas agora, nestes últimos dias, estão em perigo novamente, pois, para
nossa tristeza, o Um foi encontrado. Outros devem falar do achado, pois neste
ponto tive um papelpequeno.
Ele parou, mas imediatamente Boromir se levantou, alto e imponente diante deles. - Dê-me
permissão, Mestre Elrond - disse ele -, primeiro para dizer mais sobre Gondor,
pois exatamente de lá eu venho. E seria bom para todos saber o que se passa ali. Poucos
sabem, pelo que vejo, de nossos feitos, e portanto adivinham pouca coisa
do perigo que os ameaça, se viéssemos a falhar.
- Não creiam que na terra de Gondor o sangue de Númenor esteja dissipado, nem que toda
sua dignidade e esplendor foram esquecidos. Por nossos esforços, o povo selvagem
do Leste ainda não avançou, e o terror de Morgul é mantido sob controle; só assim são
mantidas a paz e a liberdade nas terras atrás de nós, que somos o baluarte
do Oeste. Mas se as passagens do Rio fossem tomadas, o que aconteceria?

- Mas talvez essa hora não esteja longe. O Inimigo Inominável se levanta outra vez. A
fumaça sobe de novo de Orodruin, que chamamos de Montanha da Perdição. O poder
da Terra Negra cresce, e estamos sendo duramente acossados. Quando o Inimigo voltou,
nosso povo foi expulso de Ithilien, nosso belo domínio a Leste do Rio, embora
tenhamos mantido lá um Ponto de apoio e força de armas. Mas neste mesmo ano, nos dias de
junho,
#260
uma guerra repentina nos sobreveio de Mordor, e fomos expulsos de vez. Estávamos em menor
número, pois Mordor se aliou aos Orientais e aos cruéis Haradrim; mas não
foi pelo número que fomos derrotados. Havia ali um poder que nunca sentíramos antes.
- Alguns diziam que era visível, na forma de um grande cavaleiro negro, uma sombra escura
sob a lua. Onde quer que ele aparecesse, nossos inimigos ficavam furiosos,
enquanto o medo dominava nossos guerreiros mais corajosos, de modo que homens e cavalos
cediam e fugiam. Apenas uma parte restante de nossa força no Leste voltou,
destruindo a última ponte que ainda resistia entre as ruínas de Osgiliath.
- Eu estava nesse grupo que ocupava a ponte, até que ela foi destruída atrás de nós.
Apenas quatro se salvaram nadando: meu irmão, eu, e outros dois. Mas continuamos
lutando, mantendo o domínio das praias a Oeste do Anduin; aqueles que se abrigam atrás de
nós nos elogiam: elogiam muito mas não ajudam em nada. Atualmente, apenas
de Rohan viria algum homem quando pedíssemos socorro.
- Nesta hora maligna, eu vim numa missão, atravessando muitas milhas perigosas, até
Elrond: cento e dez dias viajei completamente sozinho. Mas não procuro aliados
para a guerra. O poder de Elrond está em sua sabedoria, não nas armas, como se diz. Vim
pedir aconselhamento e ajuda para desvendar palavras duras. Pois na véspera
do ataque súbito, meu irmão teve um sonho durante um sono agitado; e depois disso tinha
freqüentemente um sonho semelhante, e uma vez eu também tive.
- Nesse sonho, vi o céu do Leste ficar cinza-escuro, e havia um trovão crescente, mas no
Oeste uma luz pálida permanecia, e vindo dela eu escutava uma voz, remota
mas clara, gritando:
Procure a Espada quefoi quebrada.- Em Imladris ela está;
Mais fortes que de Morgul encantos Conselhos lhe darão lá.
E lá um sinal vai ser revelado Do Fim que está por vir
E a Ruína de Isildur já acorda, E o Pequenojá vai surgir.
Dessas palavras, pudemos entender pouca coisa, e falamos com nosso pai, Denethor, Senhor
de Minas Tirith, sábio na tradição de Gondor. Ele só disse que Iraladris
fora, há muito tempo, o nome usado pelos elfos para um vale no extremo Norte, onde
Elrond, o Meio-elfo, morava, o maior dos eruditos na tradição. Portanto, meu irmão,
vendo o desespero de nossa necescidade,
#261
estava ansioso para atender ao que dizia o sonho, e procurar Imladris; mas, já que o
caminho era cheio de dúvidas e perigos, encarreguei-me da viagem.
Meu pai relutou em dar permissão para minha partida, e muito vaguei por estradas
abandonadas, procurando a casa de Elrond, da qual muitos tinham ouvido falar, mas
poucos sabiam onde ficava.
- E aqui, na casa de Elrond, mais coisas lhe serão esclarecidas - disse Aragorn,
levantando-se. Colocou sua espada sobre a mesa diante de Elrond, e a lâmina ainda
estava partida em dois pedaços. - Aqui está a Espada que foi Quebrada! - disse ele.
- E quem é você, e o que tem a ver com Minas Tirith? - perguntou Boromir, olhando
surpreso para o rosto magro do guardião e para sua capa surrada.
Ele é Aragorn, filho de Arathorn - disse Elrond -, e descende, através de muitas
gerações, de
Isildur, filho de Elendil, de Minas lthil. É o chefe dos dúnedain no
Norte; poucos restam agora desse povo.

Então ele pertence a você e não a mim! - gritou Frodo surpreso, levantando-se, como se
esperasse que alguém pedisse o Anel imediatamente.
- Ele não pertence a nenhum de nós - disse Aragorn. - Mas foi ordenado que você o
guardasse por um período.
- Traga o Anel, Frodo! - disse Gandalf solenemente. - A hora chegou. Mostre-o, e então
Boromir entenderá o restante do enigma.
Fez-se silêncio e todos voltaram os olhos para Frodo. Ele foi tomado de repente pela
vergonha e pelo medo, sentindo uma grande relutância em revelar o Anel, e uma
aversão de tocá-lo. Desejou estar bem longe. O Anel brilhou e cintilou, conforme o erguia
diante deles, com a mão trêrnula.
- Veja a Ruína de Isildur! - disse Elrond.
Os olhos de Boromir reluziram quando olharam para o objeto de ouro.
- O Pequeno! - gaguejou ele. - Então o fim de Minas Tirith finalmente chegou? Mas por que
então devíamos procurar uma espada quebrada?
- As palavras não eram ofim de Minas Tirith - disse Aragorn. - Mas o fim e grandes feitos
se aproximam realmente. Pois a Espada que foi Quebrada é a Espada de Elendil,
que se partiu quando ele caiu por cima dela. Foi guardada por herdeiros, quando todo o
resto da herança foi perdido; disseram-nos que seria refeita quando o Anel,
a Ruína de Isildur, fosse encontrado. Agora que você viu a espada que procurava, o que
dirá? Deseja que a Casa de Elendil retorne à Terra de Gondor?
- Não fui enviado para implorar nenhum favor, mas apenas para procurar o significado de
um enigma - respondeu Boromir orgulhosamente. Mas estamos sendo fortemente
pressionados, e a Espada de Elendil seria
#262
uma ajuda além de nossas expectativas... se uma coisa dessas pudesse realmente voltar das
sombras do passado. - Olhou de novo para Aragorn, cheio de dúvidas.
Frodo sentiu Bilbo se mexer impacientemente ao seu lado. Evidentemente estava zangado por
seu amigo. Levantando-se de súbito, ele falou numa explosão:
Nem tudo o que é ouro fulgura, Nem todo o vagante é vadio;
O velho que éforte perdura,
Raiz funda não sofre ofrio.
Das cinzas um fogo há de vir Das sombras a luz vaijorrar;
A espada há de, nova, luzir,
O sem-coroa há de reinar
- Talvez não muito bom, mas perfeito para o momento - se e que voce precisa de algo mais
além da palavra de Elrond. Se ela vale uma viagem de cento e dez dias, é
melhor escutá-la com mais atenção. - Sentou-se furioso.
- Eu mesmo compus isso - cochichou ele para Frodo. - Para o Dúnadan, há muito tempo,
quando me contou coisas sobre sua história pela primeira vez. Quase começo a
desejar que minhas aventuras não tivessem terminado, e que pudesse acompanhá-lo quando o
dia chegar.
Aragorn sorriu para ele; depois voltou-se outra vez para Boromir. De minha parte, perdôo
sua dúvida - disse ele. - Sou pouco semelhante às figuras de Elendil e Isildur
que estão entalhadas em sua majestade nos salões de Denethor. Sou apenas um herdeiro de
Isildur, não Isildur em pessoa. Tive uma vida dura e longa; e as milhas que
se estendem entre este lugar e Gondor são uma pequena fração na soma de minhas viagens.
Atravessei muitas montanhas e muitos rios, e pisei em muitas planícies, chegando
até mesmo às regiões distantes de Rhún e Harad, onde as estrelas são estranhas.
Mas minha casa, a meu ver, fica no Norte. Pois aqui os herdeiros de Valandil sempre
viveram, numa longa linhagem contínua de pai para filho por muitas gerações.
Nossos dias escureceram e diminuímos em número; mas sempre a espada era passada para um
novo guardião. E isto direi a você, Boromir, antes de terminar. Somos homens
solitários, guardiões das Terras Ermas, caçadores - mas sempre caçamos os servidores do
Inimigo; pois estes podem ser encontrados em muitos lugares, e não apenas
em Mordor.

- Se Gondor, Boromir, tem sido uma torre robusta, nós tivemos outra função. Existem
muitas coisas más que nossas muralhas fortes e espadas
#263
brilhantes não agÜentam. Você sabe pouco sobre as terras além de suas fronteiras. Paz e
liberdade, você diz?
O Norte mal saberia o que são essas coisas se não fosse
por nós. O medo destruiria a todos. Mas quando os seres escuros vêm das colinas
desabitadas, ou se esgueiram por florestas sem sol, fogem de nós. Que estradas qualquer
um ousaria pisar, que segurança haveria nos lugares pacíficos, ou nas casas dos homens
simples à noite, se os dúnedain estivessem dormindo, ou tivessem todos ido
para o túmulo?
- Mesmo assim, recebemos menos agradecimentos que vocês. Os viajantes nos desprezam, e os
homens do campo nos dão nomes pejorativos. Sou "Passolargo" para um homem
gordo que vive num lugar a apenas um dia de marcha de inimigos que congelariam seu
coração, ou deixariam sua pequena cidade em ruínas, se não fosse guardado continuamente.
Mesmo assim, não aceitaríamos outro tipo de vida. Se as pessoas estão livres do medo e da
preocupação, é porque são simples, e devemos mantê-las assim em segredo.
Essa tem sido a tarefa de meu povo, enquanto os anos vão se alongando e o capim vai
crescendo.
- Mas agora o mundo está mudando outra vez. Uma nova hora se aproxima. A Ruína de Isildur
foi encontrada. A Batalha está chegando. A Espada será reforjada. Irei
a Minas Tirith.
- Você diz que a Ruína de Isildur foi encontrada - disse Boromir. - Vi um anel brilhante
na mão do Pequeno; mas Isildur morreu antes de esta era do mundo começar.
Como os Sábios podem saber que esse anel é o dele? E como ele passou todos esses anos,
até ser trazido aqui por um mensageiro tão estranho?
- Isso será contado - disse Elrond.
- Mas ainda não, eu peço, Mestre - disse Bilbo. - O sol já está chegando ao meio-dia, e
sinto necessidade de algo para me fortalecer.
- Não tinha nomeado você - disse Elrond. - Mas faço isso agora. Venha! Conte-nos sua
história. E se ainda não a transformou em versos, você pode contá-la em palavras
simples. Quanto mais rápido for, mais depressa será alimentado.
- Muito bem - disse Bilbo. - Farei como pede. Mas vou contar a história verdadeira, e se
alguém aqui já me ouviu contando-a de outra maneira - olhou de lado para
Glóin -, peço que esqueçam e me perdoem. Naquela época, desejava apenas afirmar que o
tesouro pertencia só a mim, e me livrar da pecha de ladrão que me havia sido
lançada. Mas talvez eu tenha um entendimento melhor das coisas agora. De qualquer forma,
foi isto o que aconteceu.
Para alguns ali, a história de Bilbo era inteiramente nova, e eles ouviam surpresos,
enquanto o velho hobbit, na verdade não totalmente contrariado,
#264
recontava sua aventura com Gollum, do começo ao fim. Não omitiu uma charada sequer. Teria
também feito um relato de sua festa e do desaparecimento do Condado, se
lhe fosse permitido, mas Elrond levantou a mão.
- Bem contado, meu amigo - disse ele. - Mas isso é o suficiente por enquanto. Para o
momento, basta sabermos que o Anel passou às mãos de Frodo, seu herdeiro. Deixe-o
falar agora!
Então, menos disposto que Bilbo, Frodo contou todas as suas façanhas com o Anel, desde o
dia em que a guarda lhe fora confiada. Cada passo de sua viagem da Vila
dos Hobbits até o Vau do Bruinen foi questionado e ponderado, e tudo o que ele pôde
lembrar a respeito dos Cavaleiros Negros foi examinado. Finalmente, sentou-se
de novo.
- Nada mau - disse-lhe Bilbo. - Você teria contado uma boa história, se não ficassem
interrompendo a todo momento. Tentei anotar umas coisas, mas vamos ter de repassar

toda a história juntos numa outra ocasião, se é que vou escrevê-la. Há capítulos inteiros
sobre eventos anteriores à sua chegada aqui!
- É, fiz uma longa história - respondeu Frodo. - Mas ainda me parece que não está
completa. Ainda quero saber muita coisa, especialmente sobre
Gandalf.
Galdor dos Portos, sentado ao lado, escutou o que diziam. - Você também fala por mim disse ele; e voltando-se para Elrond, falou: - Os sábios podem ter bons motivos
para considerar que o tesouro do Pequeno é realmente o Grande Anel tão debatido, embora
isso pareça improvável para aqueles que sabem menos. Mas não podemos ouvir
as provas? E eu também perguntaria o seguinte: E Saruman? Ele é erudito nos estudos sobre
os Anéis, e apesar disso não está entre nós.
O que diria, se soubesse das coisas que ouvimos?
- As perguntas que faz, Galdor, estão entrelaçadas - disse Elrond. Não as negligenciei, e
elas serão respondidas. Mas essas coisas compete a Gandalf esclarecer,
e eu o chamo por último, pois esse é o lugar de honra, e em toda essa questão ele tem
sido o chefe.
-Alguns, Galdor - disse Gandalf -, pensariam que as notícias de Glóin e a perseguição de
Frodo são provas suficientes de que o tesouro do Pequeno é uma coisa de
grande valor para o Inimigo. Apesar disso, é apenas um anel. E então? Os Nove estão em
poder dos Nazgôl. Os Sete foram levados ou estão destruidos. - Com isso Glóin
se mexeu na cadeira, mas nada falou. - Dos Três nós sabemos. O que então seria este Um,
que ele tanto deseja?
- Na verdade, existe um grande lapso de tempo entre o Rio e a Montanha, entre a perda e o
achado. Mas a falha no conhecimento dos Sábios
#265
foi sanada finalmente. Mas muito devagar. Pois o Inimigo vinha logo atrás, mais
próximo até do que eu temia. E é bom que só tenha conhecido a verdade inteira neste
último ano; ao que parece, neste verão.
-Alguns aqui poderão recordar que, muitos anos atrás, eu mesmo ousei atravessar as portas
do Necromante em Dol Guldur, e explorei em segredo suas práticas, e assim
descobri que nossos temores eram fundados: ele não era ninguém menos que o próprio
Sauron, nosso antigo Inimigo, finalmente tornando forma e recuperando o poder
outra vez. Alguns também poderão lembrar que Saruman tentou nos dissuadir de fazer algo
abertamente contra ele, e por muito tempo apenas o vigiamos. Mas finalmente,
à medida que as sombras cresciam, Saruman cedeu, e o Conselho reuniu suas forças e
expulsou o mal da Floresta das Trevas - e aquele foi exatamente o ano em que o
Anel foi encontrado: estranho acaso, se é que foi um acaso.
- Mas estávamos muito atrasados, como Elrond previra. Sauron também estivera nos
vigiando, e se preparava havia muito tempo para nosso golpe, governando Mordor à
distância, de Minas Morgul, onde seus Nove servidores estavam morando, até que tudo
estivesse pronto. Então ele se rendeu diante de nós, mas apenas fingiu partir
em fuga, e logo depois chegou à Torre Escura, e declarou-se abertamente. Então, pela
última vez, o Conselho se reuniu, pois nesse momento soubemos que ele procurava
o Um Anel mais desesperadamente que nunca. Tememos na época que ele soubesse alguma coisa
que ainda ignorávamos. Mas Saruman disse que não, e repetiu o que já tinha
nos dito antes: que o Anel jamais seria encontrado outra vez na Terra-média.
- "Na pior das hipóteses", dizia ele, "nosso Inimigo sabe que não estamos com o Anel,
pois ainda está perdido. Mas acha que o que foi perdido pode ser reencontrado.
Nada temam! A esperança que tem vai traí-lo. Então eu não estudei essa questão
minuciosamente?
O Anel caiu no Grande Rio Anduin; e há muito tempo, enquanto Sauron
dormia, foi rolando pelo Rio até o Mar. Deixemo-lo ficar ali até o Fim.
Gandalf ficou quieto, olhando para o Leste através do alpendre, examinando os picos
distantes das Montanhas Sombrias, em cujas grandes raízes o perigo do mundo por
tanto tempo se ocultara. Ele suspirou.

- Nesse ponto, falhei - disse ele. - Fui ludibriado pelas palavras de Saruman, o Sábio;
deveria ter procurado a verdade antes, e agora nosso perigo seria menor.
- Todos nós falhamos - disse Elrond. - E se não fosse por sua vigilância, talvez a
Escuridão já tivesse caído sobre nós. Mas continue!
- Desde o início, meu coração pressentia o que contrariava toda a razão que eu conhecia disse Gandalf - E eu desejava saber como essa coisa
#266
chegou até Gollum e por quanto tempo estivera em seu poder. Então comecei a procurá-lo,
supondo que logo apareceria para procurar seu tesouro, E de fato apareceu,
mas escapou e não foi encontrado. E então, infelizmente, deixei o assunto descansar,
apenas vigiando e esperando, como fizemos muitas vezes.
- O tempo passou, com muitas apreensões, até que minhas dúvidas despertaram de novo,
transformando-se num medo repentino. De onde vinha o anel do hobbit? O que,
se minhas dúvidas fossem fundadas, deveríamos fazer com ele? Essas coisas eu tinha de
decidir. Mas não falei a ninguém de meus temores, sabendo do perigo de uma
menção inoportuna, caso chegasse aos ouvidos errados. Em todas as longas guerras contra a
Torre Escura, a traição sempre foi nosso maior inimigo.
- Isso foi há dezessete anos. Logo soube que espiões de toda sorte, até animais e
pássaros, reuniam-se em torno do Condado, e meu medo cresceu. Pedi o auxílio dos
dúnedain, que redobraram sua vigilância; abri meu coração para Aragorn, o herdeiro de
Isildur.
- E eu - disse Aragorn -, achei melhor procurarmos Gollum, embora parecesse muito tarde.
E, uma vez que parecia adequado que o herdeiro de Isildur tentasse reparar
a falta de seu antepassado, empreendi com Gandalf uma busca longa e infrutífera.
Então Gandalf contou que tinham explorado toda a região das Terras Ermas, chegando até
mesmo às Montanhas da Sombra e às fronteiras de Mordor. - Ali escutamos rumores
sobre ele, e supusemos que tinha morado por longo tempo lá, nas colinas escuras; mas não
o encontramos, e finalmente perdi as esperanças. Então pensei outra vez
num teste que poderia dispensar a localização de Gollum. O próprio anel poderia me dizer
se era o Um Anel. A lembrança das palavras pronunciadas no Conselho voltou
à minha memória: palavras de Saruman, semi-ocultas na ocasião. Agora eu as escutava
claramente em meu coração.
- "Os Nove, os Sete e os Três", dizia ele, "todos tinham uma pedra própria. Mas não o Um
Anel, que era redondo e sem adornos, como se fosse o menos importante dos
anéis; mas quem o fez desenhou nele marcas que os habilidosos, talvez, ainda poderiam ver
e ler."
- Quais eram essas marcas ele não dizia. Quem poderia saber agora? Quem o fez. E Saruman?
Embora seu conhecimento pudesse ser muito grande, devia se originar de
alguma fonte. Que outra mão, fora a de Sauron, teria segurado esse objeto, antes que
fosse perdido? Apenas a mão de
Isildur.
- Pensando nisso, abandonei a busca, e fui rapidamente para Gondor. Nos primeiros tempos,
os membros de minha ordem eram bem recebidos lá, mas Saruman sempre merecia
as honras maiores. Freqüentemente ficava
#267
ali, como hóspede dos Senhores da Cidade. Não fui tão bem recebido pelo Senhor Denethor
dessa vez como antigamente e com má vontade ele permitiu que eu vasculhasse
entre os livros e pergaminhos que guardava como relíquias.
- "Se é verdade que você só está procurando registros dos tempos antigos e das origens da
Cidade, como diz, vá em frente!", disse ele, "pois, para mim, o que passou
foi menos sombrio do que o que está por vir, e essa é minha preocupação. Mas, a não ser
que você tenha mais habilidade que o próprio Saruman, que estudou aqui muito
tempo, não achará nada que não seja bem conhecido por mim, que sou um mestre nas
tradições da Cidade."

- Assim falou Denethor. E mesmo assim, em sua posse há muitos registros que agora apenas
alguns conseguem ler, até mesmo entre os mestres nas tradições, pois suas
escritas e línguas se tornaram obscuras para os homens que vieram depois. E, Boromir,
acho que ainda existe em Minas Tirith um manuscrito que não foi lido por ninguém,
a não ser por Saruman e por mim, feito pelo próprio Isildur. Porque Isildur não se
retirou imediatamente da guerra de Mordor, como contaram alguns.
-Alguns no Norte, talvez - interrompeu Boromir. -Todos em Gondor sabem que primeiro ele
foi para Minas Anor e morou ali por um tempo com o sobrinho, Meneldil, instruindo-o,
antes de confiar a ele o governo do Reino do Sul. Nessa época, plantou ali a última muda
da Árvore Branca, em memória do irmão.
- Mas nessa época ele também fez esse manuscrito - disse Gandalf E isso não é lembrado em
Gondor, ao que parece. Pois esse manuscrito se refere ao Anel, e assim
Isildur escreveu:
O Grande Anel deve agora se transformar em parte da herança do Reino do Norte; mas
registros dele serão deixados em Gondor onde também moram os herdeiros de Elendil,
para evitar que venha um tempo em que a memória dessas questões importantes seja
obscurecida.
E depois dessas palavras Isildur descreveu o Anel, tal como o encontrou:
Estava quente no primeiro momento em que o peguei, quente como brasa, e minha mão se
queimou, de tal modo que duvidei que algum dia pudesse me ver livre da dor
causada pela queimadura. Apesar disso, no momento em que escrevo, está frio, e parece que
encolheu, embora sem ter perdido a beleza ou a forma . A escrita que há
nele, que no início estava visível como uma chama vermelha, já desapareceu, e mal pode
ser lida. As letras são de uma caligrafia
élfica de Eregion, pois não há em
Mordor letras para um trabalho tão sutil; mas a língua me é desconhecida. Suponho que
seja
#268
uma língua da Terra Negra, uma vez que é desagradável e rústica. Que maldade está aqui
impressa eu não sei dizer; traço uma cópia, para evitar que desapareça e nunca
mais seja recuperada. Talvez o Anel sintafalta do calor da mão de Sauron, que era negra e
mesmo assim queimava como fogo, e assim Gil-galadfoi destruido; e talvez,
se o ourofor reaquecido, a inscrição fique visível outra vez. Mas, de minha parte, não
arriscarei danificar uma coisa dessas: de todos os trabalhos de Sauron, o
único belo. Éprecioso para mim, embora o tenha adquirido à custa de muito sofrimento.
- Quando li essas palavras, minha busca terminou. Pois a caligrafia da inscrição estava
de fato, como Isildur supusera, na língua de Mordor e dos servidores da Torre.
E o que dizia já era conhecido. Pois no dia em que Sauron colocou o Um Anel pela primeira
vez, Celebrimbor, que havia feito os Três, estava consciente dele, e de
longe escutou-o pronunciar essas palavras, e assim seus propósitos maléficos foram
revelados.
- Imediatamente, despedi-me de Denethor, mas no mesmo momento em que me dirigia para o
Norte mensagens chegavam até mim vindas de Lórien, dizendo que Aragorn tinha
passado por ali, e que tinha encontrado a criatura chamada Gollum. Portanto, fui primeiro
encontrá-lo e ouvir sua história. Por quais perigos tinha ele passado
sozinho, eu não ousava imaginar.
- Não há necessidade de comentá-los - disse Aragorn. - Se um homem precisar passar à
vista do Portão Negro, ou pisar nas flores mortais do Vale Morgul, perigos encontrará.
Eu, também, fiquei desesperado no final, e comecei minha viagem de volta para casa.
Então, por sorte, finalmente encontrei o que procurava: a marca de pés fofos
numa poça lamacenta. Eram pegadas novas e rápidas, conduzindo não a Mordor, mas para
longe dali. Ao longo das margens dos Pântanos Mortos as segui, e então o encontrei.
Espreitando perto de um brejo estagnado, olhando a água quando a noite escura caía,
peguei-o,
Gollum. Estava coberto de musgo esverdeado. Receio que nunca gostará

de mim, pois me mordeu, e não foi nem um pouco gentil. Nada mais consegui daquela boca
além de marcas de dentes. Considerei essa a pior parte de toda a minha viagem,
a estrada de volta, vigiando-o dia e noite, forçando-o a andar na minha frente com uma
coleira no pescoço, amordaçado, enquanto não fosse domado pela falta de comida
e bebida, conduzindo-o sempre para a Floresta das Trevas. Levei-o até lá finalmente, e o
entreguei para os elfos, pois tínhamos combinado que isso seria feito; fiquei
feliz em me livrar de sua companhia, pois fedia. De minha parte, espero nunca mais ter de
olhar para ele outra vez; mas Gandalf chegou e suportou uma longa conversa
com ele.
- Sim, longa e cansativa - disse Gandalf - Mas não sem resultados. Em primeiro lugar, a
história que contou, de como havia perdido o Anel, batia com a que Bilbo
acabou de contar abertamente pela primeira vez; mas
#269
isso pouco importava, uma vez que já tinha adivinhado. Mas então descobri, primeiro,
que o anel de Gollum vinha do Grande Rio perto dos Campos de Lis. E descobri
também que ele o tinha possuído por longo tempo. Por muitas vidas de sua reduzida
espécie.
O poder do anel tinha alongado seus anos de vida muito além da média;
mas esse poder é concedido apenas pelos Grandes Anéis.
- Mas se isso ainda não for prova suficiente, Galdor, ainda há o outro teste que
mencionei. Nesse mesmo Anel que acabaram de ver exibido, redondo e sem adornos,
as letras que Isildur mencionou ainda podem ser lidas, se alguém tiver a força de vontade
de colocar o Anel no fogo por uns momentos. Fiz isso e li o seguinte:
Ash nazg dupbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.»
A mudança na voz do mago era assombrosa. De repente ficou ameaçadora, poderosa, dura como
pedra. Uma sombra pareceu passar sobre o sol alto, e o alpendre ficou escurecido
por uns momentos. Todos tremeram, e os elfos tamparam os ouvidos.
- Nunca antes uma voz ousou pronunciar palavras nessa língua em Imladris, Gandalf, o
Cinzento - disse Elrond, quando a sombra passou e o grupo pôde respirar outra
vez.
- E esperemos que ninguém jamais fale essa língua aqui de novo respondeu Gandalf. - Não
obstante isso, não peço suas desculpas, Mestre Elrond. Pois se essa língua
não estiver prestes a ser ouvida em todos os cantos do Oeste, então que todos deixem de
lado a dúvida de que esse objeto é realmente o que os Sábios declararam:
o tesouro do Inimigo, carregado de toda a sua malícia; e nele está uma grande parte de
sua força de antigamente. Vêm dos Anos Negros as palavras que os Ourives de
Eregion escutaram, sabendo assim que tinham sido traídos:
Um Anel para a todos governar Um Anel para encontrá-los, Um Anel para a todos trazer. e
na Escuridão aprisioná-los.
- Saibam ainda, meus amigos, que soube de mais coisas conversando com
Golllum. Ele relutava em falar e a história que contava era obscura, mas está fora de
qualquer
dúvida que ele foi até Mordor, e ali tudo o que sabia lhe foi arrancado à força. Desse
modo, o Inimigo sabe que o Anel foi encontrado, que ficou muito tempo no Condado;
e já que seus servidores o Perseguiram quase até nossa porta, logo saberá, e já pode
estar sabendo, neste momento em que falo, que o temos aqui.
#270
Todos ficaram em silêncio por um tempo, até que finalmente Boromir falou. - Ele é uma
coisa pequena, você diz, esse Gollum? Pequeno, mas grande na maldade.
O que aconteceu com ele? Que destino lhe foi imposto?
- Está preso, mas nada além disso - disse Aragorn. - Já tinha sofrido muito. Não há
dúvida de que foi atormentado, e o medo de Sauron está cravado, negro, em seu
coração. Mesmo assim, pessoalmente sinto-me feliz em saber que ele está sendo vigiado
pelos olhos atentos dos elfos da Floresta das Trevas. Tem uma grande malícia,

que lhe dá uma força difícil de se acreditar numa criatura tão magra e maltratada. Ainda
poderia operar muitas maldades, se estivesse livre. E não duvido de que
obteve permissão para deixar Mordor em alguma missão maligna.
Infelizmente! - gritou Legolas, e em seu belo rosto élfico via-se uma grande perturbação.
- As notícias que fui encarregado de trazer precisam agora ser dadas. Não
são boas, mas só aqui percebi quão péssimas elas podem ser para este grupo. Sméagol, que
agora é chamado de Gollum, escapou.
- Escapou? - gritou Aragorn. - Essa notícia é realmente péssima. Receio que todos vamos
lamentá-la amargamente. Como aconteceu de o povo de
Thranduil falhar na confiança nele depositada?
- Não foi por falta de vigilância - disse Legolas. - Mas talvez por demasiada gentileza.
E receamos que o prisioneiro tenha recebido ajuda de outros, e que se saiba
mais de nossos feitos do que poderíamos desejar. Guardamos essa criatura, dia e noite, a
pedido de Gandalf, embora nos cansássemos muito com tal tarefa. Mas Gandalf
pediu que ainda tivéssemos esperanças em relação à cura dele, e não tivemos coragem de
mantê-lo constantemente em masmorras sob a terra, onde ele poderia de novo
alimentar seus pensamentos negros.
- Vocês foram menos gentis comigo - disse Glóin com um brilho nos olhos, conforme se
agitavam em sua mente as recordações de sua prisão nas profundezas dos salões
do rei élfico.
Ora vamos! - disse Gandalf - Peço que não interrompa, meu bom Glóin. Aquilo foi um engano
lamentável, há muito desfeito. Se todas as mágoas que separam os anões
dos elfos forem trazidas à tona aqui, é melhor abandonarmos este Conselho.
Glóin se levantou e fez uma reverência. Legolas continuou. - Nos dias de tempo bom,
levávamos Gollurn pela floresta, e havia ali uma árvore alta, distante das outras,
na qual gostava de subir. Sempre o deixávamos subir até os galhos mais altos, até que
sentisse o vento livre; mas fazíamos guarda no pé da árvore. Um dia, recusou-se
a descer, e os guardas não quiseram subir atrás dele: Gollum tinha aprendido o truque de
se pendurar nos galhos pelos pés tão bem quanto pelas mãos; então sentaram-se
ao lado da árvore até noite alta.
#271
- Foi exatamente naquela noite de verão, apesar de não ter lua nem estrelas, que os
orcs nos atacaram de surpresa. Expulsamo-los depois de algum tempo; eram ferozes
e estavam em grande número, mas vinham das montanhas e não estavam acostumados às
florestas. Quando a batalha terrninou, descobrimos que Gollum tinha fugido, e
seus guardas foram assassinados ou capturados. Então ficou claro que o ataque tinha sido
feito para resgatá-lo, e que ele já sabia de antemão o que estava por acontecer.
Como isso foi armado, não podemos saber; mas Gollum é esperto, e os espiões do Inimigo
são muitos. As criaturas escuras que tinham sido expulsas no ano da queda
do Dragão voltaram em grande número, e a Floresta das Trevas é agora um lugar maligno,
exceto onde nosso reinado está sendo mantido.
- Não conseguimos recapturar Gollum. Encontramos suas pegadas entre as de muitos
orcs, e elas mergulharam fundo para dentro da Floresta, em direção ao Sul. Mas
logo ultrapassaram nossa habilidade, e não ousamos continuar a caçada, pois estávamos
chegando muito perto de Dol Guldur, e aquele ainda é um lugar muito mau; não
enveredamos por aqueles lados.
- Bem, bem, ele se foi - disse Gandalf - E não temos tempo para procurá-lo outra vez. Que
faça o que quiser. Mas pode ser que ainda tenha um papel que nem ele nem
Sauron previram.
- E agora responderei às outras perguntas de Galdor. E Saruman? Que diria ele nesta hora?
Essa história preciso contar inteira, pois apenas Elrond a conhece, e resumida,
mas ela terá conseqüências em tudo o que decidirmos. É o último capítulo da História do
Anel, até o presente momento.
- No fim de junho eu estava no Condado, mas uma nuvem de ansiedade cobria minha mente, e
eu fui até a fronteira Sul da pequena terra; pois tinha pressentimento de

algum perigo, ainda oculto, mas que se aproximava. Ali, mensagens chegaram até mim,
contando sobre guerra e derrota em Gondor, e quando ouvi sobre a Sombra Negra,
senti um frio no coração. Mas nada encontrei, a não ser alguns fugitivos do Sul; mesmo
assim tive a impressão de que sentiam um medo que não mencionavam. Fui então
em direção ao Leste e ao Norte, e viajei ao longo do Caminho Verde; não muito longe de
Bri, encontrei um viajante sentado num barranco à beira da estrada, e seu
cavalo pastando atrás dele. Era Radagast, o Castanho, que numa época morou em Rhosgobel,
perto das fronteiras da Floresta das Trevas. Ele faz parte de minha ordem,
e eu não o via fazia muitos anos.
- "Gandalfl", disse ele. "Estava procurando você. Mas sou um estranho nestas partes. Tudo
o que sabia é que você poderia ser encontrado numa região selvagem, com
o nome esquisito de Condado."
- "Sua informação estava certa", disse eu. "Mas não fale assim, se encontrar algum
habitante de lá. Você está perto da fronteira do Condado agora.
#272
E o que quer comigo? Deve ser importante. Você nunca foi um viajante, a não ser por
grande necessidade."
- "Tenho uma missão urgente", disse ele. "Minha notícia é má." Então olhou ao redor, como
se as cercas-vivas tivessem ouvidos. "Nazgúl", sussurrou ele. "Os Nove
estão de novo à solta. Atravessaram o Rio em segredo e estão indo para o Oeste. Tomaram a
forma de cavaleiros vestidos de preto."
- Soube então do que temia sem saber.
- "O Inimigo deve ter alguma necessidade ou propósito importante", disse Radagast; "mas o
que o faz olhar em direção a estas partes distantes e desoladas, não posso
adivinhar."
- "O que está querendo dizer?", disse eu.
- "Disseram-me que, aonde quer que cheguem, os Cavaleiros pedem notícias de uma terra
chamada Condado."
- "O Condado", disse eu, mas meu coração ficou pesado. Pois mesmo os Sábios podem ter
medo de enfrentar os Nove, quando estão reunidos e sob o comando de seu líder
mortal. Antigamente, ele foi um grande rei e feiticeiro, e agora emana um pavor mortal.
"Quem lhe disse isso, e quem o enviou?", perguntei.
- "Saruman, o Branco", respondeu Radagast. "E me recomendou que dissesse a você que pode
ajudá-lo se precisar; mas que você deve procurar sua ajuda imediatamente,
ou será tarde demais."
- E essa mensagem me trouxe esperança. Pois Saruman, o Branco, é o maior de minha ordem.
Radagast, claro, é um mago valoroso, um mestre das formas e das mudanças
de cores; tem muito conhecimento das ervas e dos animais, e os pássaros em especial são
seus amigos. Mas Saruman vem estudando há muito tempo as artes do Inimigo,
e desse modo conseguimos muitas vezes antecipar-nos. Foi pelos métodos de Saruman que
expulsamos o Inimigo de Dol Guldur. Podia ser que ele tivesse descoberto armas
para rechaçar os Nove.
- "Irei até Saruman", disse eu.
- "Então deve ir agora", disse Radagast, "pois perdi tempo procurando você, e os dias
estão se acabando. Recomendou-me que o encontrasse antes do Solstício de Verão,
e esse dia está chegando. Mesmo que você parta daqui, será difícil alcançá-lo antes que
os Nove descubram a terra que procuram. Quanto a mim, voltarei imediatamente."
E com isso montou no cavalo e teria partido naquele instante.
- "Espere um minuto", disse eu. "Vamos Precisar de sua ajuda, e da ajuda de todos os
seres que possam cooperar. Envie mensagens a todos os animais e pássaros
que
são seus amigos. Diga-lhes para trazerem notícias de tudo o que se relacione a esse
assunto de Saruman e Gandalf Envie mensagens a
Orthanc."

-Farei isso", disse ele, e partiu como se os Nove estivessem em seu encalço.
- Não pude segui-lo naquele momento e daquele lugar. Já tinha cavalgado
muito longe naquele dia, e estava tão cansado quanto meu cavalo, e precisava pensar nas
coisas. Passei a noite em Bri, e decidi que não tinha tempo para voltar até o Condado.
Nunca cometi um erro tão grande!
- Entretanto, escrevi uma mensagem para Frodo, e confiei-a ao meu amigo, o estalajadeiro,
para enviá-la. Parti na manhã do dia seguinte; e finalmente cheguei à
moradia de Saruman, Fica no extremo Sul de Isengard, no fim das Montanhas Sombrias, não
distante do Desfiladeiro de
Rollan. E Boromir dirá a vocês que é um grande
vale aberto que fica entre as Montanhas Sombrias e os contrafortes mais setentrionais de
Ered Nimrais, as Montanhas Brancas de sua terra. Mas Isengard é um círculo
de rochas íngremes que envolvem o vale como uma muralha, e no meio desse vale há uma
torre de pedra chamada Orthanc. Não foi construída por Saruman, mas pelos homens
de Númenor há muito tempo; é muito alta e encerra muitos segredos; mesmo assim, não
parece ser um trabalho de construtores. Não se pode alcançá-la, a não ser passando
pelo círculo de Isengard, e naquele círculo só há um portão.
- Uma noite, bem tarde, cheguei a esse portão, semelhante a um grande arco na muralha de
rochas. Estava fortemente guardado. Mas os guardas estavam vigiando, à minha
espera, e me disseram que Saruman me aguardava. Passei por baixo do arco, e o portão se
fechou silenciosamente atrás de mim; de repente senti medo, embora não conhecesse
motivo para isso.
- "Então, você veio, Gandalf ", disse-me ele num tom grave; mas em seus olhos parecia
haver uma luz branca, como se um riso frio estivesse em seu coração.
- "Sim, eu vim", disse eu. "Vim pedir sua ajuda, Saruman, o Branco." Esse título pareceu
enraivecê-lo.
- "É mesmo, Gandalf, o Cinzento?", zombou ele. "Ajuda? É raro se ouvir que Gandalf, o
Cinzento, pediu ajuda a alguém, uma pessoa tão inteligente e sábia, vagando
pelas terras e se intrometendo em todas as coisas, quer lhe digam respeito ou não."
- Olhei para ele, surpreso. "Mas se não estou enganado", disse eu, "estão acontecendo
coisas que irão requerer a união de todas as nossas forças."
- "Pode ser", disse ele, "mas esse pensamento lhe ocorreu tarde demais.
Pergunto-me por quanto tempo escondeu de mim, o chefe do Conselho, um assunto da maior
importância.
O que o traz aqui agora, vindo de seu ponto de espreita no Condado?"
- "Os Nove avançaram de novo", respondi. "Atravessaram o Rio. Assim me disse Radagast."
#274
- "Radagast, o Castanho!", riu Saruman, não mais escondendo o desprezo que sentia.
"Radagast, o Domador de Pássaros! Radagast, o Simplório! Radagast, o Tolo! Mas
pelo menos teve a capacidade de desempenhar a função que lhe designei. Você veio, e esse
foi o propósito de minha mensagem. E aqui você permanecerá, Gandalf, o Cinzento,
para descansar das viagens. Pois sou Saruman, o Sábio, Saruman, o Fazedor de Anéis,
Saruman de Muitas Cores!"
- Olhei então e vi que as roupas que vestia, que tinham parecido brancas, não eram dessa
cor, mas de todas as cores, e se ele se mexia, mudavam de tonalidade e brilhavam,
de modo que os olhos ficavam confusos.
- "Eu gostava mais do branco", disse eu.
- "Branco!", zombou ele. "Serve para começar. O pano branco pode ser tingido. Pode-se
escrever sobre a página em branco; a luz branca pode ser decomposta."
- "E nesse caso deixa de ser branca", disse eu. "E aquele que quebra uma coisa para
descobrir o que ela é deixou o caminho da sabedoria."
- "Não precisa falar comigo do modo como se dirige aos tolos que tem por amigos", disse
ele. "Não o trouxe até aqui para receber instruções suas, mas para lhe dar
uma escolha.Os direitos sobre essa obra são protegidos pelas leis internacionais de Copyright. Não pode ser vendido, imprimido nem

Pôs-se de pé e então começou a declamar, como se estivesse fazendo um discurso
longamente ensaiado. "Os Dias Antigos se foram. Os Dias Médios estão passando. Os
Dias Mais Jovens estão começando. A época dos elfos se acabou, mas nosso tempo está
chegando: o mundo dos homens, que devemos governar. Mas precisamos de poder,
poder para ordenar todas as coisas como queremos, para o bem que apenas os Sábios podem
enxergar."
- "E ouça bem, Gandalf, meu velho amigo e ajudante!", disse ele, vindo em minha direção e
falando agora com uma voz mais suave. "Eu disse nós, pois poderá ser nós,
se quiser se unir a mim. Um novo Poder se levanta. Contra ele, as velhas alianças e
políticas não nos ajudarão em nada. Não há mais esperança nos elfos ou na agonizante
Númenor. Esta então é uma escolha diante de você, diante de nós. Podemos nos unir a esse
Poder. Seria uma sábia decisão, Gandalf. Existe esperança por esse caminho.
A vitória dele se aproxima, e haverá grandes recompensas para aqueles que o ajudarem.
Enquanto o Poder crescer, os que se mostrarem seus amigos também crescerão;
e os Sábios, como você e eu, poderão, com paciência, vir finalmente a governar seus
rumos, e a controlá-lo. Podemos esperar nossa hora, podemos guardar o que pensamos
em nossos corações, talvez deplorando as maldades feitas incidentalmente, mas aprovando o
propósito final e mais alto: Conhecimento, Liderança, Ordem; todas as coisas
que até agora lutamos em vão para conseguir, mais atrapalhados que ajudados por nossos
amigos fracos e inúteis. Não precisaria haver, e não haveria, qualquer mudança
em nossos propósitos, só em nossos meios."
#275
"Saruman", disse eu. "Já escutei discursos desse tipo antes, mas apenas das bocas dos
emissários enviados de Mordor para enganar os ignorantes. Não Posso crer que
tenha me trazido de tão longe só para cansar meus ouvidos."
- Lançou-me um olhar oblíquo, e parou um pouco, pensando. "Bem, vejo que este caminho
sábio não funciona no seu caso", disse ele. "Ainda não? Não se uma maneira
melhor puder ser criada?"
- Aproximou-se e colocou a mão longa sobre meu braço. "E por que não,
Gandalf?", sussurrou ele. "Por que não? O Anel Governante? Se pudéssemos dominá-lo, então
o
Poder passaria para nós. Foi por isso, na verdade, que o trouxe até aqui. Pois tenho
muitos olhos trabalhando para mim, e acredito que você sabe agora onde esse
objeto precioso está. Não é verdade? ou então, por que os Nove querem saber sobre o
Condado, e qual é o interesse que você tem lá?" E enquanto dizia isso, um desejo
ardente que ele não podia ocultar brilhava em seus olhos.
"Saruman", disse eu, afastando-me dele, "só uma mão de cada vez pode governar o Anel, e
você sabe disso muito bem; então não se preocupe em dizer nós! Mas eu não
o daria a você, nunca! Não daria nem notícias dele, agora que sei o que se passa na sua
cabeça. Você foi chefe do Conselho, mas desmascarou a si mesmo finalmente.
Bem, as opções são, ao que parece, submeter-me a Sauron ou a você. Não escolho nenhuma
das duas. Não tem outras para oferecer?
-Agora ele estava frio e perigoso. "Sim", disse ele. "Não esperava que demonstrasse
sabedoria, mesmo para sua própria vantagem; mas dei-lhe a chance de me ajudar
por bem, e de se poupar de muitos problemas e sofrimentos. A terceira opção é ficar aqui,
até o fim."
- "Até o fim?"
- "Até que me revele onde o Um Anel pode ser encontrado. Posso procurar meios de
persuadi-lo. Ou até que seja encontrado à sua revelia, e o Governante possa se voltar
para questões mais leves: encontrar, vamos dizer, uma recompensa adequada para a falta de
colaboração e a insolência de Gandalf, o Cinzento."
- "Essa pode acabar não sendo uma das questões mais leves", disse eu. Ele riu de mim,
pois minhas palavras eram vazias, e ele sabia disso.
- Levaram-me e me colocaram no pináculo de Orthanc, no lugar onde Saruman costumava olhar
as estrelas. Não há por onde descer, a não ser por uma escada estreita

de muitos milhares de degraus, e o vale lá embaixo parece muito distante. Olhei para ele
e vi que, embora já tivesse sido verde e belo, estava agora cheio de poços
e forjas. Lobos e orcs estavam alojados em Isengard, pois Saruman estava reunindo uma
grande força por sua própria

conta, rivalizando com Sauron, e não ainda aos serviços dele. Sobre todas as suas
construções, uma fumaça escura pairava e se adensava em torno das paredes de
Orthanc. Fiquei sozinho, numa ilha em meio as nuvens; não tinha chance de escapar, e meus
dias foram amargos.
O frio me atravessava os ossos, e eu só tinha um pequeno espaço para andar de um lado
para o outro, pensando na chegada dos Cavaleiros ao Norte.
- De que os Nove tinham de fato se levantado, eu tinha certeza, mesmo sem as palavras de
Saruman, que poderiam ser mentirosas. Muito antes de chegar a Isengard eu
tinha escutado notícias que não poderiam ser falsas. O medo pelos meus amigos do Condado
era constante em meu coração; mas eu ainda tinha alguma esperança. Tinha
esperança de que Frodo tivesse partido imediatamente, como minha carta pedia, e que
tivesse chegado a Valfenda antes que a perseguição fatal começasse. E tanto meu
medo quanto minha esperança acabaram se mostrando infundados. Pois minha esperança se
fundava num homem gordo de Bri, e meu medo na esperteza de Sauron. Mas homens
gordos que vendem cerveja têm muitos pedidos para atender, e o poder de Sauron ainda é
menor do que o medo nos faz crer. Porém, no círculo de Isengard, preso e solitário,
seria dificil pensar que os caçadores, diante dos quais todos fugiram ou caíram,
falhariam no distante Condado.
- Eu vi você! - gritou Frodo. - Estava andando de um lado para o outro. A lua brilhava em
seu cabelo.
Gandalf parou atônito, e olhou para ele. - Foi apenas um sonho - disse Frodo. - Mas que
de repente volta à minha mente. Tinha me esquecido. Veio há algum tempo;
depois que parti do Condado, eu acho.
- Então demorou a chegar - disse Gandalf. - Como você vai ver. Eu estava numa situação
péssima. E os que me conhecem concordarão que raramente fiquei numa situação
de tanta necessidade, e que não suporto bem um infortúnio desses. Gandalf, o Cinzento,
preso como uma mosca na teia traiçoeira de uma aranha! Mas mesmo as aranhas
mais caprichosas podem deixar um fio frouxo.
- Primeiro pensei, como Saruman sem dúvida pretendia, que Radagast também fosse um
traidor. Mas não tinha percebido nada de errado em sua voz ou em seus olhos quando
nos encontramos. Se tivesse, jamais teria ido a Isengard, ou teria sido mais cauteloso.
Assim Saruman supunha, e tinha escondido seus pensamentos e enganado
o mensageiro. Teria sido inútil, de qualquer forma, tentar convencer o honesto Radagast a
se aliar a um projeto de maldade e traição. Procurou-me de boa-fé, e assim
me convenceu.
- Essa foi a ruína do plano de Saruman. Pois Radagast não via motivos para não fazer o
que eu pedira, e cavalgou até a Floresta das Trevas, onde tinha muitos amigos
antigos. E as Águias das Montanhas se espalharam, e
#277
viram muitas coisas: o ajuntamento dos lobos
e os orcs se agrupando; os Nove
Cavaleiros indo de cá para lá nos muitos lugares; também escutaram notícias sobre
a fuga de Gollum. E enviaram um mensageiro para me trazer as novas.
- Foi assim que, quando o verão terminava, veio uma noite enluarada, e Gwaihir, o Senhor
do Vento, a mais rápida entre as Grandes Águias, chegou inesperadamente
a Orthanc, encontrando-me no pináculo. Então falei com ele, que me carregou embora, antes
que Saruman soubesse. Eu já estava longe de Isengard, quando os lobos e
os orcs saíram pelo portão à minha procura.
-Até onde pode me levar?", perguntei a Gwaihir.

- "Por muitas milhas", disse ele, "mas não até o fim do mundo. Fui enviado para
transportar notícias, não fardos."
- "Então vou precisar de um cavalo quando pousarmos", disse eu. "E um cavalo
extraordinariamente rápido, pois nunca precisei tanto da velocidade antes."
- "Se é assim, vou levá-lo a Edoras, onde o Senhor de Rohan fica em seus palácios", disse
ele, "pois esse lugar não fica longe daqui." E fiquei contente, pois
em
Rohan, a Terra dos Cavaleiros, os Roffirrim, Senhores dos Cavalos, moram, e não há
cavalos como aqueles que são criados no grande vale entre as Montanhas Sombrias
e as Brancas.
- "Acha que ainda se pode confiar nos Homens de Rohan?", perguntei a Gwaihir, pois a
traição de Saruman abalara minha fé.
- "Eles pagam um tributo em cavalos", respondeu ele, "e enviam muitos a Mordor
anualmente; pelo menos é o que se diz; mas não estão submetidos àquele jugo. Mas se
Saruman se tornou mau, como me diz, então a desgraça deles não pode ser postergada por
muito tempo."
- Deixou-me na terra de Rohan antes do amanhecer; e agora me alonguei demais na minha
história.
O resto será mais breve. Em Rohan, já encontrei o mal em ação: as
mentiras de Saruman; o rei daquela região não deu ouvidos às minhas advertências. Disseme que pegasse um cavalo e fosse embora, e escolhi um bem ao meu gosto, mas
nada ao gosto dele. Peguei o melhor cavalo que havia, e nunca vi outro igual.
- Então deve ser um animal realmente nobre - disse Aragom. - E me entristece, muito mais
que outras notícias que possam parecer piores, saber que Sauron arrecada
tal tributo. Não era assim quando estive por lá.
- Nem é agora, posso jurar - disse Boromir. - Essa é uma mentira que vem do Inimigo.
Conheço os homens de
Rohan, verdadeiros e destemidos, nossos aliados, que
ainda moram nas terras que ofertamos a eles há muito tempo.
#278
- A sombra de Mordor alcança terras distantes - respondeu Aragorn.
- Saruman foi subjugado por ela. Rohan está cercada. Quem sabe o que você poderá
encontrar lá, se algum dia voltar?
- Pelo menos, isso não - disse Boromir. - Que compram as vidas com cavalos. Aquele povo
ama seus animais quase como a seus familiares. E não sem razão, pois os cavalos
da Terra dos Cavaleiros vêm dos campos do Norte, distantes da Sombra, e sua raça, como a
de seus donos, descende dos dias livres de antigamente.
- Isso é verdade! - disse Gandalf - E há um entre eles que poderia ter nascido na aurora
do mundo. Os cavalos dos Nove não podem disputar com ele; incansável, rápido
como o vento. Chamavam-no de Scadufax. Durante o dia, seus pêlos brilham como prata, e de
noite ficam como sombra, e ele passa sem ser visto. Cavalga levemente!
Nunca antes havia sido montado por qualquer homem, mas peguei-o e o domei, e tão rápido
me levou, que cheguei ao Condado quando Frodo estava nas Colinas dos Túmulos,
embora eu tenha partido de Rohan apenas quando ele deixava o Condado.
- Mas o medo crescia em mim à medida que avançava com o cavalo. Logo que cheguei ao
Norte, ouvi notícias dos Cavaleiros, e, embora me aproximasse deles dia após
dia, estavam sempre na minha frente. Soube que tinham dividido suas forças: alguns
permaneciam na fronteira Leste, não muito distante do Caminho Verde, e alguns
invadiram o Condado partindo do Sul. Cheguei à Vila dos Hobbits e Frodo tinha partido;
mas conversei com o velho
Gamgi. Muitas palavras, e poucas que me interessavam.
Ele tinha muito a dizer sobre os defeitos dos novos proprietários de Bolsão.
- "Não posso suportar mudanças", dizia ele, "não na minha idade, muito menos mudanças
para pior." "Mudanças para pior", repetia ele muitas vezes.
- "Pior é uma palavra ruim", disse-lhe eu. "E espero que não viva para ver o que é pior."
Mas em meio a toda a conversa, descobri finalmente que Frodo tinha deixado

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
a Vila dos Hobbits menos de uma semana antes, e que um cavaleiro negro tinha vindo até a
Colina na mesma noite. Então parti apavorado. Cheguei à Terra dos Buques
e encontrei o lugar em tumulto, as pessoas agitadas como formigas que tiveram seu
formigueiro remexido por uma bengala. Fui à casa em Cricôncavo e a encontrei aberta
e vazia. Mas na entrada havia uma capa que pertencera a Frodo. Então, por uns momentos,
perdi as esperanças, e não esperei para saber mais coisas, ou teria sido
consolado. Cavalguei seguindo a trilha dos Cavaleiros. Era dificil fazê-lo, pois as
pegadas iam por muitos caminhos, e fiquei perdido. Mas me pareceu que um ou dois
tinham ido na direção de Bri; e por ali fui, pois pensava em palavras que poderiam ser
ditas ao estalajadeiro.
- "Chamam-no Carrapicho", pensava eu. "Se essa demora foi culpa dele, vou espetá-lo com
todos os carrapichos do mundo. Vou assar o velho
#279
idiota em fogo brando." Ele não esperava menos, e quando viu meu rosto caiu duro, e
começou a derreter ali mesmo.
- Que fez com ele? - perguntou Frodo alarmado. - Foi muito gentil conosco, e fez tudo o
que pôde.
Gandalf riu. - Não tenha medo! - disse ele. - Não mordi, e lati muito pouco. Fiquei tão
contente com as notícias que me deu quando parou de trenler, que abracei
o velho camarada. Como isso aconteceu, não pude adivinhar naquela hora, mas soube que
você estivera em Bri na noite anterior, e tinha partido naquela manhã com Passolargo.
- "Passolargo! -, gritei de alegria.
- "Sim, senhor. Receio que sim, senhor", disse Carrapicho, não me compreendendo. "Ele os
abordou, apesar de tudo o que fiz, e foram todos juntos. Comportaram-se
de modo muito estranho durante todo o tempo em que estiveram aqui: teimosos, pode-se
dizer."
- , Idiota! Tolo! Três vezes valoroso e querido Cevado!", disse eu. "Esta é a melhor
notícia que ouço desde o solstício de verão: vale pelo menos uma moeda de ouro.
Que sua cerveja fique sob um encantamento de extraordinária qualidade por sete anos!",
disse eu. "Agora posso ter uma noite de descanso, a primeira desde já me esqueci
quando."
- Então passei ali a noite, pensando muito no que teria acontecido aos Cavaleiros; pois
ali em Bri só havia notícia de dois deles, ao que parecia. Mas durante a
noite ouvimos mais. Pelo menos cinco vieram do Oeste; derrubaram os portões e passaram
por Bri como um vento avassalador; e o povo de Bri ainda está tremendo, esperando
o fim do mundo. Levantei-me antes de amanhecer e fui atrás deles.
- Não tenho certeza, mas me parece óbvio que foi isto que aconteceu: o Capitão deles
permaneceu em segredo, ao Sul de Bri, enquanto dois avançaram através da aldeia,
e outros quatro invadiram o Condado. Mas quando estes não tiveram êxito em Bri e em
Cricôncavo, voltaram para encontrar o Capitão e lhe dar notícias, deixando assim
a Estrada livre por um período, a não ser pela presença dos espiões. O Capitão enviou
alguns em direção ao Leste, atravessando diretamente o campo, e ele próprio,
juntamente com o resto, cavalgou ao longo da Estrada cheio de ira.
- Galopei até o Topo do Vento como um raio, e cheguei antes do pôrdo-sol do meu segundo
dia de viagem depois de Bri - e eles estavam ali, na Minha frente. Afastaram-se
de mim, pois sentiram meu ódio crescer, e não ousaram enfrentá-lo à luz do dia. Mas se
aproximaram de noite, e fui acuado no topo da colina, no velho círculo de
Amon Súl. Mas foi dificil me enfrentar: tamanhas luzes e chamas não foram vistas no Topo
do Vento desde Os faróis de guerra de antigamente.
#280
- Com o nascer do dia, escapei e fugi para o Norte. Não podia ter esperanças de fazer
mais nada. Era impossível encontrar você, Frodo, naquele lugar desolado, e
teria sido tolice tentar com todos os Nove em meus calcanhares. Então tive de confiar em
Aragorn. Esperava despistar alguns deles, e ainda chegar a Valfenda na frente

de vocês e enviar ajuda. Quatro Cavaleiros realmente me seguiram, mas deram as costas
depois de um tempo, dirigindo-se para o Vau, ao que parece. Isso ajudou um
pouco, pois havia apenas cinco, e não nove, quando o acampamento foi atacado.
- Finalmente, cheguei aqui por uma estrada longa e dificil, subindo o Fontegris e
atravessando a Charneca Etten, e depois descendo do Norte. Levou quase catorze
dias do Topo do Vento até aqui, pois não pude ir a cavalo entre as rochas e os outeiros
dos trolls, e Scadufax se foi. Enviei-o de volta ao dono, mas uma grande
amizade nasceu entre nós, e se precisar ele virá ao meu chamado. Mas foi assim que
cheguei a Valfenda só três dias antes do Anel, quando notícias dos perigos que
corria já tinham chegado aqui - por sinal verdadeiras.
- E este, Frodo, é o fim de meu relato. Que Elrond e os outros desculpem o tempo que
tomei. Mas nada assim tinha acontecido antes, de Gandalf faltar a um compromisso
e não chegar no momento prometido. Acho que o Portador do Anel merecia um relato de um
acontecimento tão estranho.
- Bem, agora a História foi contada, do início ao fim. Aqui estamos todos, e aqui está o
Anel, mas ainda não chegamos nem perto de nosso propósito. Que faremos com
ele?
Fez-se silêncio. Finalmente, Elrond tomou de novo a palavra.
- Essa notícia sobre Saruman é muito triste - disse ele. - Confiávamos nele, e sempre
demos atenção especial aos seus conselhos. É perigoso aprofundar-se demais
nas artes do Inimigo, para o bem ou para o mal. Mas quedas e traições desse tipo,
infelizmente, já ocorreram antes. Das histórias que foram contadas aqui hoje, a
de Frodo foi a mais estranha para mim. Conheci alguns hobbits além de Bilbo aqui, e me
parece que talvez ele não seja tão solitário e singular como eu tinha pensado.
O mundo mudou muito desde que estive pela última vez nas estradas que conduzem ao Oeste.
- Conhecemos as Criaturas Tumulares por muitos nomes; e a respeito da Floresta Velha
muitas histórias foram contadas: tudo o que resta agora é apenas um remanescente
da sua borda setentrional. Houve um tempo em que um esquilo podia ir, de árvore em
árvore, da região que agora é o Condado até a Terra Parda, a Oeste de Isengard.
Viajei por aquelas terras uma vez, e conheci muitas coisas estranhas e selvagens. Mas
tinha me esquecido de Bombadil, se é que esse é o mesmo que caminhava nas florestas
e colinas há muito tempo, e mesmo naquela época ele era mais velho que os velhos.
#281
Nesse tempo, tinha outro nome. Chamavam-no de Iarwain Ben-adar, o mais antigo e sem pai.
Mas outros nomes lhe foram dados por vários povos: Forn pelos anões, Orald
pelos homens do Norte, e outros nomes além desses. É uma criatura estranha, mas talvez
devesse tê-lo chamado para o Conselho.
- Não teria vindo - disse Gandalf.
- Não poderíamos, mesmo assim, enviar mensagens a ele e pedir sua ajuda? - perguntou
Erestor. - Parece que tem poder até sobre o Anel.
- Não, eu não colocaria as coisas dessa forma - disse Gandalf - É melhor dizer que o Anel
não tem poder sobre ele. Ele é seu próprio senhor. Mas não pode alterar
o próprio Anel, nem desfazer o poder deste sobre os outros. E agora se retirou para uma
região pequena, dentro de limites que ele mesmo fixou, embora ninguém consiga
enxergá-los, talvez esperando uma mudança dos dias, e não sai dali.
- Mas, dentro desses limites, nada parece afetá-lo - disse Erestor. Ele não poderia pegar
o Anel e guardá-lo ali, mantendo-o para sempre inofensivo?
- Não - disse Gandalf. - Não estaria disposto a isso. Poderia fazê-lo, se todos os povos
livres do mundo lhe pedissem, mas não entenderia a necessidade. E se recebesse
o Anel, logo o esqueceria, ou mais provavelmente iria jogá-lo fora. Essas coisas não têm
lugar em sua mente. Seria um guardião arriscado, e isso já é resposta suficiente.
- Mas, de qualquer forma - disse Glorfindel -, enviar-lhe o Anel seria apenas postergar o
dia do mal. Ele está distante. Não poderíamos levar-lhe o Anel sem que
isso fosse objeto de suspeita ou observação de algum espião. E, mesmo que pudéssemos,
mais cedo ou mais tarde o Senhor dos Anéis saberia do esconderijo, e avançaria

com todo o seu poder naquela direção. Poderia esse poder ser desafiado por Bombadil
sozinho? Acho que não. Acho que, no fim, se todo o resto for conquistado, Bombadil
sucumbirá, vindo a ser o último, da mesma forma como foi o Primeiro; e então a Noite
virá.
- Sei pouco sobre Iarwain além do nome - disse Galdor. - Mas acho que Glorfindel está
certo.
O poder para desafiar o Inimigo não está nele, a não ser que esteja
na própria terra. E, mesmo assim, podemos ver que Sauron tem o poder de torturar e
destruir as próprias colinas.
O poder que ainda resta está conosco, aqui em Imladris,
ou com Círdan nos Portos, ou em Lórien. Mas será que eles têm a força; será que nós aqui
temos a força para resistir ao Inimigo, à última investida de Sauron, quando
todo o resto estiver destruido?
- Eu não tenho a força - disse Elrond. - Nem eles.
- Então, se não se pode evitar que ele se apodere do Anel, nem pela força - disse
Glorfindel -, restam apenas duas coisas a fazer: enviá-lo por sobre o Mar, ou destruí-lo.
#282
- Mas Gandalf nos revelou que não se pode destruí-lo com nenhUM poder que possuamos disse Elrond. - E aqueles que moram além do Mar não o receberiam: para o bem
ou para o mal, o Anel pertence à Terra-média; nós, que ainda moramos aqui, é que devemos
lidar com ele.
- Então - disse Glorfindel -, vamos jogá-lo nas profundezas, e assin, transformar as
mentiras de Saruman em verdades. Pois agora está claro que, mesmo quando ele
ainda fazia parte do Conselho, seus pés trilhavam um caminho tortuoso. Sabia que o Anel
não estava perdido para sempre, mas queria que pensássemos assim, pois começou
a desejá-lo para si. Mas muitas vezes a verdade se esconde nas mentiras: no Mar, o Anel
estaria a salvo.
- Não para sempre - disse Gandalf. - Existem muitos seres nas águas profundas, e os máres
e as terras podem se alterar. Não é nossa função aqui fazer planos que
só durem uma estação, ou algumas vidas dos homens, ou uma era passageira do mundo.
Devemos buscar um fim definitivo para essa ameaça, mesmo que não tenhamos esperança
de alcançar tal objetivo.
- E essa esperança não poderemos encontrar nas estradas que vão para o Mar - disse
Galdor. - Se o retorno a
Iarwain foi considerado perigoso demais, então a fuga
para o Mar está agora repleta dos perigos mais graves. Meu coração me diz que Sauron vai
esperar que tomemos o caminho do Oeste, quando souber o que aconteceu. Logo
saberá. Os Nove realmente estão sem cavalos, mas isso é apenas momentâneo, até que
encontrem novos cavalos, ainda mais velozes. Apenas o poder enfraquecido de Gondor
está entre ele e uma força em marcha ao longo da costa, dirigindo-se para o Norte; se ele
vier e atacar as Torres Brancas e os Portos, depois disso os elfos não
terão escapatória das sombras que se estendem sobre a Terra-média.
- Mas essa marcha vai ser atrasada por um bom tempo - disse Boromir. - Você disse que
Gondor está perdendo as forças. Mas Gondor ainda está de pé, e mesmo o fim
de sua força ainda é muito forte.
- Então - disse Erestor -, só há dois caminhos, como já declarou Glorfindel: esconder o
Anel para sempre, ou desfazê-lo. Mas ambas as coisas estão além de nosso
poder. Quem nos poderia desvendar esse enigma?
- Ninguém aqui pode - disse Elrond, com uma voz grave. - Pelo menos, ninguém pode
predizer o que virá a acontecer, se tomarmos esta ou aquela estrada. A estrada
em direção ao Oeste parece mais fácil. Portanto, deve ser descartada. Será vigiada. Os
elfos fugiram por ali muitas vezes. Agora, no mínimo, devemos tomar uma estrada
dificil, uma estrada imprevista. Ali está nossa esperança, se é que chega a ser uma
esperança. Caminhar em direção ao perigo - para Mordor. Precisamos enviar o Anel
para o Fogo.

Novamente se fez silêncio. Frodo, mesmo naquela bela casa, que dava para um vale
iluminado pelo sol, cheio do ruído de águas límpidas, sentia
#283
uma escuridão mortal tomar-lhe o coração. Boromir se mexeu na cadeira, e Frodo olhou para
ele. Estava mexendo em sua grande corneta com os dedos, de cenho franzido.
Finalmente falou.
- Não entendo tudo isso - disse ele. - Saruman é um traidor, mas será que não teve um
lance de sabedoria? Por que vocês só falam em esconder ou destruir? Por que
não considerar que o Grande Anel chegou às nossas mãos para nos servir exatamente nesta
hora de necessidade? Controlando-o, os Senhores Livres dos Livres podem certamente
derrotar o Inimigo. Considero que isso é o que ele mais teme.
- os homens de Gondor são valorosos, e nunca vão se submeter; mas podem ser derrotados.
O valor precisa, em primeiro lugar, de força, e depois de uma arma. Deixem
que o Anel seja nossa arma, se tem tanto poder como dizem. Vamos tomá-lo e avançar para a
vitória!
- Infelizmente não - disse Elrond. - Não podemos usar o Anel Governante. Disso sabemos
muito bem. Ele pertence a Sauron e foi feito exclusivamente por ele, e é
totalmente maligno. A força que tem, Boromir, é grande demais para qualquer um controlar
por sua própria vontade, com exceção apenas daqueles que já têm um grande
poder próprio. Mas, para estes, o Anel representa um perigo ainda mais fatal. Apenas
desejá-lo já corrompe o coração. Considere Saruman. Se algum dos Sábios derrotasse
com esse Anel o Senhor de Mordor, usando as próprias artes, então se colocaria no trono
de Sauron, e um outro Senhor do Escuro surgiria. E esta é outra razão pela
qual o Anel deve ser destruido: enquanto permanecer no mundo, representará um perigo
mesmo para os Sábios. Pois nada é mau no início. Até mesmo Sauron não era. Tenho
medo de tomar o Anel para escondê-lo. E não vou tomá-lo para fazer uso dele.
- Nem eu - disse Gandalf
Boromir olhou para eles com dúvidas, mas abaixou a cabeça. - Que assim seja! - disse ele.
- Então, em Gondor, teremos de confiar nas armas que temos. E no mínimo,
enquanto os sábios guardam o Anel, continuaremos lutando. Talvez a E spada-que- foi Quebrada possa lutar contra a maré
- se a mão que a empunha não tiver obtido apenas uma herança, mas a fibra dos Reis dos
Homens.
- Quem poderá dizer? - disse Aragorn. - Mas vamos testá-la um dia.
- Que o dia não demore muito - disse Boromir. - Pois, embora eu não esteja pedindo ajuda,
precisamos dela. Seria um consolo saber que outros também lutaram com todos
os meios que possuem.
- Então sinta-se consolado - disse Elrond. - Pois existem outros poderes e reinos que não
conhece, ocultos de seu conhecimento.
O Grande Rio Andum passa por muitos
lugares, antes de chegar até Argonath e os Portões de Gondor.
#284
- Mesmo assim, seria melhor para todos - disse Glóin, o anão - se todas essas forças
fossem reunidas, e os poderes de cada um fossem usados em aliança. Talvez haja
outros anéis, menos traiçoeiros, que possam ser usados em nossa necessidade. Os Sete
foram perdidos por nós - se Balin não encontrou o Anel de Thrór, que era o último;
nada se sabe dele desde que Thrór sucumbiu em Moria. Na verdade, posso agora revelar que
tinha
uma certa esperança de encontrar aquele anel que Balin foi procurar.
- Balin não vai achar anel nenhum em Moria - disse Gandalf - Thrór o deu a Thráin, seu
filho, mas Thráin não o deu a Thorin. Entregou-o mediante tortura nos calabouços
de Dol Guldur. Cheguei tarde demais.
- Que infelicidade! - disse Glóin. - Quando chegará o dia de nossa vingança? Mas ainda há
os Três. Onde estão os Três Anéis dos elfos? Anéis muito poderosos, pelo

que se diz. Os Senhores Élficos não os guardam? Mas esses também foram feitos pelo Senhor
do Escuro há muitos anos. Seriam inúteis? Vejo Senhores Élficos aqui. Eles
não vão se pronunciar?
Os elfos não responderam. - Você não ouviu o que eu disse, Glóin? disse Eirond. - Os Três
não foram feitos por Sauron, que nunca sequer os tocou. Mas sobre eles
não se permite falar. Não são inúteis. Mas não foram feitos para serem usados como armas
de guerra ou conquista: não é esse o poder que têm. Aqueles que os fizeram
não desejavam força, ou dominação, ou acúmulo de riquezas; mas entendimento, ações e
curas, para preservar todas as coisas imaculadas. Essas coisas os elfos da Terra-média
ganharam em certa medida, mas com sofrimento, Mas tudo o que foi realizado por aqueles
que usam os Três será desfeito, e suas mentes e corações serão revelados a
Sauron, se este recuperar o Um Anel. Seria melhor que os Três nunca tivessem existido.
Este foi o propósito dele.
- Mas então o que aconteceria, se o Anel Governante fosse destruído, como desejamos? perguntou Glóin.
- Não sabemos ao certo - respondeu Elrond com tristeza. - Alguns têm esperança de que os
Três, jamais tocados por Sauron, seriam então libertados, e seus governantes
poderiam então curar as feridas do mundo, criadas por ele. Mas pode ser que quando o Um
Anel for destruido, os Três percam sua força, e muitas coisas belas desapareçam
e sejam esquecidas. É nisso que acredito.
- Mesmo assim, todos os elfos estão dispostos a arriscar essa possíbilidade - disse
Glorfindel -, se através dela o poder de Sauron puder ser desfeito, e o terror
de seu domínio puder ser banido para sempre.
- Então voltamos novamente à destruição do Anel - disse Erestor. - E mesmo assim, ainda
estamos onde começamos. Que força possuímos para encontrar o Fogo no qual
foi feito? Esse é o caminho do desespero. Da tolice, eu diria, se a longa sabedoria de
Eirond não me proibisse.
#285
- Desespero, ou tolice? - disse Gandalf - Desespero não, pois o desespero e para aqueles
que enxergam o fim como fato consumado. Não, não. É sábio reconhecer a necessidade,
quando todas as outras soluções já foram ponderadas, embora possa parecer tolice para
aqueles que têm falsas esperanças. Bem, que a tolice seja nosso disfarce, um
véu diante dos olhos do Inimigo! Pois ele é muito sábio, e pondera todas as coisas com
exatidão. nas balanças de sua malícia. Mas a única medida que conhece é o
desejo, desejo de poder; e assim julga que são todos os corações. Seu coração não cogita
a possibilidade de qualquer um recusá-lo; de que, tendo o Anel em mãos,
vamos procurar destruí-lo. Se tentarmos fazer isso, vamos despistá-lo.
- Pelo menos por um tempo - disse Elrond. - A estrada deve ser percorrida, mas será muito
dificil. E nem a força nem a sabedoria nos levarão muito longe, caminhando
por ela. Essa busca deve ser empreendida pelos fracos com a mesma esperança dos fortes.
Mas é sempre assim o curso dos fatos que movem as rodas do mundo: as mãos
pequenas os realizam porque precisam, enquanto os olhos dos grandes estão voltados para
outros lugares.
- Muito bem, muito bem, Mestre Efrond! - disse Bilbo de repente. Não precisa dizer mais
nada! Está claro que e para mim que está apontando. Bilbo, o tolo hobbit,
começou este caso, e é melhor Bilbo dar cabo dele, ou de si mesmo. Eu estava muito bem
aqui, continuando meu livro. Se quiser saber, eu estava escrevendo um fim
para ele. Pensei em colocar: e ele viveu feliz para sempre até o fim de seus dias. É um
ótimo fim, e não faz mal que já tenha sido usado antes. Agora terei de alterá-lo:
não é provável que se torne verdade; e, de qualquer forma, é evidente que terei de
acrescentar muitos outros capítulos, se viver para escrevê-los. É um trabalho
terrível. Quando devo partir?
Boromir olhou com surpresa para Bilbo, mas o riso morreu-lhe nos lábios quando viu que
todos os outros olhavam o velho hobbit com grande respeito. Apenas Glóin sorriu,
mas o sorriso veio de antigas lembranças.

- É claro, querido Bilbo - disse Gandalf - Se você realmente tivesse começado este caso,
seria de esperar que o terminasse. Mas você sabe muito bem que esse início
é reivindicação demais para uma só pessoa, e que um herói só tem um papel pequeno nos
grandes feitos. Não precisa fazer reverência! Embora a intenção do elogio seja
verdadeira, e não duvidemos que, Por trás dessa galhofa, você esteja fazendo uma oferta
valiosa. Mas uma Oferta além de suas forças, Bilbo. Você não pode pegar esse
objeto de volta. Ele passou a outras mãos. Se continua querendo meus conselhos, diria que
sua parte terminou, a não ser como escritor dos registros. Termine seu
livro,
#286

e não mude o fim! Existem esperanças de que ele aconteça. Mas prepare-se para escrever
uma seqüência, quando eles voltarem.
Bilbo riu. - Nunca vi você me dar um conselho agradável antes disse ele. - Como todos os
seus conselhos desagradáveis foram bons para mim, penso se este último não
será mau. Mesmo assim, não acho que ainda tenha forças ou sorte para lidar com o Anel.
Ele cresceu, e eu não. Mas, diga-me: o que quer dizer com eles?
- Os mensageiros que serão enviados com o Anel.
- Exatamente! E quem são eles? Parece-me que é isto que este Conselho precisa decidir;
aliás, é tudo o que precisa decidir. Os elfos podem se alimentar apenas de
palavras, e os anões suportam grandes cansaços; mas eu sou apenas um velho hobbit, e
preciso comer ao meio-dia. Não pode propor alguns nomes agora? Ou adiar a decisão
até depois do almoço?
Ninguém respondeu. O sino do meio-dia tocou. Mesmo assim, ninguém falava nada. Frodo
olhou para todos os rostos, mas eles não estavam voltados para ele. Todo o Conselho
se sentava com os olhos para baixo, pensando profundamente. Um grande pavor o dominou,
como se estivesse aguardando o pronunciamento de alguma sentença que ele tinha
previsto havia muito tempo, e esperado em vão que afinal de contas nunca fosse
pronunciada. Um desejo incontrolável de descansar e permanecer em paz ao lado de Bilbo
em Valfenda encheu-lhe o coração. Finalmente, com um esforço, falou, e ficou surpreso ao
ouvir as próprias palavras, como se alguma outra vontade estivesse usando
sua pequena voz.
- Levarei o Anel - disse ele. - Embora não conheça o caminho.
Elrond levantou os olhos e olhou para ele, e Frodo sentiu o coraçao devassado pela
agudeza daquele olhar. - Se entendo bem tudo o que foi dito - disse ele -, penso
que essa tarefa é destinada a você, Frodo; e que, se você não achar o caminho, ninguém
saberá. É chegada a hora do povo do Condado, quando deve se levantar de seus
campos pacíficos para abalar as torres e as deliberações dos Grandes. Quem, entre todos
os Sábios, poderia prever isto? Ou, se são mesmo sábios, por que deveriam
esperar sabê-lo, até que a hora chegasse?
- Mas o fardo é pesado. Tão pesado que ninguém poderia impô-lo a outra pessoa. Não o
imponho a você. Mas se o toma livremente, direi que sua escolha foi acertada;
e se todos os poderosos amigos-dos-elfos de antigamente, Hador, e Húrin, e Túrin, e o
próprio Beren, estivessem reunidos juntos, haveria um lugar para você entre
eles.
- Mas certamente o senhor não o enviará sozinho, Mestre? - gritou Sam, incapaz de se
conter por mais tempo, e pulando do canto onde tinha estado sentado, quieto,
sobre o chão.
#287
- Realmente não! - disse Elrond, voltando-se para ele com um sorriso. - pelo menos você
deve ir com ele. É quase impossível separá-lo de Frodo, até mesmo quando
ele é convocado para um conselho secreto, e você não.
Sam se sentou, corando e gaguejando. - Que boa enrascada esta em que nos metemos, Sr.
Frodo - disse ele, balançando a cabeça.

CAPíTULO III
O ANEL VAI PARA O SUL

Mais tarde naquele dia, os hobbits fizeram uma reunião no quarto de Bilbo. Merry e Pippin
ficaram indignados ao saber que Sam tinha se esgueirado para dentro da
sala do Conselho sem ser visto, e fora escolhido como acompanhante de Frodo.
- É a coisa mais injusta que já ouvi - disse Pippin. - Em vez de expulsá-lo e acorrentálo, Elrond vai e o recompensa por esse descaramento!
- Recompensa! - disse Frodo. - Nao posso imaginar uma punição pior. Você não sabe o que
está dizendo: condenado a ir nessa viagem inútil,
uma recompensa? Ontem
sonhei que minha tarefa tinha sido cumprida, e que eu podia descansar aqui por um bom
tempo, talvez para sempre.
- Não me admira - disse Merry. - Gostaria que você pudesse. Mas estamos com inveja de
Sam, não de você. Se precisa ir, então será uma punição para qualquer um de
nós ser deixado para trás, mesmo aqui em Valfenda. Viemos com você por uma longa estrada,
e passamos maus pedaços. Queremos prosseguir.
- É isso que eu quis dizer - disse Pippin. -Nós hobbits devemos permanecer juntos. E
vamos permanecer.
Irei,
a não ser que me acorrentem. Deve haver alguém inteligente
no grupo.
- Então certamente você não será escolhido, Peregrin Túk! - disse Gandalf, que olhava
através da janela próxima ao solo. - Mas todos vocês estão se preocupando sem
necessidade. Nada está decidido ainda.
- Nada decidido! - gritou Pippin. - Então o que todos vocês estiveram fazendo? Ficaram
trancados por horas.
- Conversando - disse Bilbo. - Houve muita conversa, e cada um descobriu um fato
revelador. Até o velho Gandalf Acho que a notícia de LegoIas sobre Golhim o pegou
despreparado, embora ele tenha disfarçado bem.
- Você se enganou - disse Gandalf. - Não estava prestando atenção. Eu já sabia do fato,
por meio de Gwaihir. Se quiser saber, o único fato revelador, como você diz,
deveu-se a você e Frodo; e eu fui o único que não se surpreendeu.
- Bem, de qualquer jeito - disse Bilbo -, nada foi decidido a não ser a escolha dos
pobres Frodo e Sam. Eu tinha receio todo o tempo de que isso Pudesse acabar acontecendo,
se eu ficasse livre. Mas, se quiserem saber, Elrond vai enviar um bom número de pessoas,
quando os relatórios chegarem. Eles já partiram, GandalP
#290
- Sim - disse o mago. - Alguns patrulheiros já foram enviados. Outros partirão amanhã.
Elrond está enviando elfos, que vão entrar em contato com os guardiões, e
talvez com o povo de Thranduil na Floresta das Trevas. E Aragorn partiu com os filhos de
Elrond. Devemos fazer
uma varredura por todas as terras da região, num
raio de várias e várias milhas, antes de qualquer outra coisa. Então alegre-se, Frodo!
Provavelmente, sua estada aqui será longa.
- Ah! - disse Sam, melancólico. - Vamos só esperar que o inverno chegue.
- Isso não se pode evitar - disse Bilbo. - Em parte a culpa foi sua, Frodo, meu rapaz:
insistir em esperar pelo meu aniversário. Um jeito curioso de homenagear a
data, não posso deixar de pensar. Não o jeito que eu teria escolhido para permitir que os

S-B's tomassem conta de Bolsão. Mas é isso: agora você não pode esperar
até a primavera, e não pode partir até que as notícias cheguem.
Assim que o inverno chega e arrocha E à noite o gelo quebra a rocha,
É negro o lago e nua a floresta,
No Ermo então vagar não presta.
Mas receio que esse seja exatamente o seu destino.
Acho que será - disse Gandalf. - Não podemos partir até sabermos o que aconteceu com os
Cavaleiros.
- Pensei que tivessem todos sido destruidos na enchente - disse Merry.
- Não se pode destruir os Espectros do Anel tão facilmente - disse Gandalf - Eles
carregam o poder daquele a quem servem, e sua queda ou resistência depende dele.
Esperamos que tenham todos ficado sem cavalos e sem máscaras, e dessa forma tenham se
tornado menos perigosos por um tempo; mas precisamos ter certeza. Enquanto
isso, você deve tentar esquecer os problemas, Frodo. Não sei se posso fazer alguma coisa
para ajudálo, mas vou dizer isto aos seus ouvidos: alguém disse que o grupo
precisará de inteligência. Essa pessoa estava certa. Acho que vou com você.
A alegria de Frodo ao ouvir isso foi tão grande que Gandalf deixou o batente da janela,
onde estava sentado, tirou o chapéu e fez uma reverência. - Eu só disse que
acho que irei. Não conte com nada ainda. Sobre isso, Elrond terá muito a dizer, e também
seu amigo, o Passolargo.
O que me faz lembrar que quero ver Elrond. Preciso sair.
- Quanto tempo você acha que ficarei aqui? - perguntou Frodo a Bilbo depois que Gandalf
saiu.
- Ah, eu não sei! Não consigo contar os dias em Valfenda - disse Bilbo.
- Mas acho que um bom tempo. Podemos conversar bastante. Que tal me ajudar com meu livro,
e começar o próximo? Já pensou num final?
Sim, pensei em vários, e todos são sombrios e desagradáveis - disse Frodo.
#291
- Ah, esses não vão servir - disse Bilbo. - Livros precisam ter finais felizes. Que tal
este: e todos eles se acomodaram e viveram juntos, felizes para sempre?
- É um bom final, se algum dia chegar a acontecer - disse Frodo.
- Ah - disse Sam. - E onde eles vão viver? É nisso que sempre penso.
Por um tempo, os hobbits continuaram a conversar e a pensar na viagem passada e nos
perigos que estavam à frente, mas a virtude da terra de Valfenda era tal, que
logo todos os medos e ansiedades foram expulsos de suas mentes. O futuro, bom ou mau,
não foi esquecido, mas deixou de ter qualquer poder sobre o presente. A saúde
e a esperança cresceram nos hobbits, que ficavam felizes com a chegada de cada novo dia,
apreciando cada refeição, cada palavra e cada canção.
Assim os dias passaram, com cada manhã surgindo bela e reluzente, e cada noite seguindo-a
fresca e clara. Mas o outono estava se esvaindo rápido. Lentamente, a luz
dourada se apagou num prata pálido, e as últimas folhas caíram das árvores nuas. Um vento
frio começou a soprar das Montanhas Sombrias em direção ao Leste. A Lua
do Caçador se exibia redonda no céu noturno, fazendo inveja a todas as estrelas menores.
Mas abaixo, no Sul, uma estrela brilhava vermelha. A cada noite, conforme
a lua minguava de novo, ela brilhava mais e mais. Frodo podia vê-la de sua janela,
profunda no céu, queimando como um olho atento que resplendia sobre as árvores
na beira do vale.
Os hobbits já estavam havia quase dois meses na casa de Elrond; novembro tinha passado,
levando os últimos resquicios do outono, e dezembro estava passando, quando
os patrulheiros começaram a retornar. Alguns tinham ido para o Norte, além das cabeceiras
do Fontegris, entrando na Charneca Etten; outros tinham ido para o Oeste,
e com o auxílio de Aragorn e dos guardiões vasculharam as terras descendo o rio Cinzento
e chegando a Tharbad, no ponto onde a antiga Estrada Norte atravessava o
rio contornando as ruínas de uma cidade. Muitos tinham ido para o Leste e para o Sul;
alguns desses tinham transposto as Montanhas e entrado na Floresta das Trevas,

enquanto outros tinham subido pela passagem na nascente do Rio de Lis, descendo pelas
Terras Ermas e chegando até os Campos de Lis, finalmente atingindo o antigo
lar de Radagast em Rhosgobel. Radagast não estava lá, e eles voltaram pela passagem
elevada que era chamada de Escada do Riacho Escuro. Os filhos de Elrond, Elladan
e Elrohir, foram os últimos a retornar; tinham feito uma longa viagem, passando pelo Veio
de Prata e
#292
entrando numa região estranha, mas só falaram sobre sua missão com Elrond.
Em parte alguma os mensageiros descobriram sinais ou notícias dos Cavaleiros ou de outros
servidores do Inimigo. Nem as Águias das Montanhas Sombrias tinham notícias
novas. Nada se ouviu ou viu sobre Gollum, mas os lobos selvagens ainda estavam se
reunindo, outra vez empreendendo caçadas, chegando até a região do Grande Rio.
Três dos cavalos negros foram encontrados imediatamente, afogados na enchente do Vau. Nas
pedras da correnteza mais abaixo, foram descobertos os cadáveres de mais
cinco, e também um longo manto negro, furado e rasgado. Não se viu qualquer outro sinal
dos Cavaleiros Negros, e em lugar algum sua presença foi sentida. Pareciam
ter desaparecido do Norte.
- Dentre os Nove, podemos saber o que aconteceu com oito, pelo menos - disse Gandalf. - É
arriscado ficarmos confiantes demais, mas acho que agora podemos ter esperanças
de que os Espectros do Anel tenham sido dispersados, e obrigados a voltar, como puderam,
ao seu Mestre em Mordor, vazios e sem forma.
- Se isso,for verdade, levará algum tempo até que consigam recomeçar a caçada.
É claro que o Inimigo tem outros servidores, mas estes terão de viajar todo o percurso
até as fronteiras de Valfenda antes de poder pegar nossa trilha. E se formos precavidos,
será dificil
encontrá-la. Mas não podemos demorar mais.
Elrond chamou os hobbits. Olhou gravemente para Frodo. - Chegou a hora - disse ele. - Se
o Anel deve partir, é preciso que vá agora. Mas os que o acompanham não
devem confiar em que sua missão seja facilitada por alguma guerra ou força. Devem entrar
no domínio do Inimigo sem ajuda. Você ainda mantém sua palavra, Frodo, de
que será o Portador do Anel?
- Sim - disse Frodo. - Irei com Sam.
- Então não posso ajudá-lo em muita coisa, nem mesmo com conselhos - disse Elrond. Consigo prever muito pouco do seu caminho, e como sua tarefa deve ser desempenhada
eu não sei. A Sombra agora já chegou aos pés das Montanhas, e avança até a região próxima
ao rio Cinzento; sob a Sombra tudo fica escuro aos meus olhos. Você vai
deparar com muitos inimigos, alguns declarados, alguns disfarçados; e poderá encontrar
amigos em seu caminho, quando menos esperar. Enviarei mensagens, quantas puder,
para todos os que conheço pelo mundo afora; mas as terras hoje em dia se tornaram tão
perigosas que algumas podem muito bem se extraviar, ou chegar depois de você.
- E escolherei pessoas para acompanhá-lo, até onde estejam dispostos ou até onde a sorte
de cada um permita. O número deve ser pequeno, Já que sua esperança repousa
na velocidade e no segredo. Mesmo que eu tivesse
#293
uma horda de elfos providos com armaduras, como nos Dias Antigos, isso de Pouco valeria,
a não ser para acordar o poder de Mordor.
- A Comitiva do Anel deverá ser composta de Nove; e os Nove Andantes devem ser colocados
contra os Nove Cavaleiros, que são maus. Com você e seu fiel servidor, Gandalf
deve partir, pois esta será sua maior tarefa, e talvez o fim de seus trabalhos.
- Quanto aos restantes, devem representar os Povos Livres do Mundo: elfos, anões e
homens. Legolas irá representando os elfos, e Gimli, filho de Glóin, representará
os anões. Estão dispostos a ir no mínimo até as passagens das Montanhas, e talvez mais
além. Representando os homens, você terá Aragorn, filho de Arathorn, pois
o Anel de Isildur é de grande interesse para ele.

Passolargo! - disse Frodo.
Sim - disse ele com um sorriso. - Peço novamente permissão para ser seu companheiro,
Frodo.
- Eu teria implorado que viesse comigo - disse Frodo -, mas pensei que você iria para
Minas Tirith com Boromir.
- E irei - disse Aragorn. - E a Espada-que-foi-Quebrada deverá ser reforjada antes que eu
parta para a guerra. Mas sua estrada e a nossa serão a mesma por multas
centenas de milhas. Portanto, Boromir também estará na Comitiva. É um homem valoroso.
- Restam mais dois - disse Eirond. - Nesses ainda vou pensar. Em minha própria casa
poderei encontrar alguém que me agrade.
Mas assim não restará lugar para nós! - gritou Pippin desanimado.
- Não queremos ficar para trás. Queremos ir com Frodo.
- Isso porque vocês não entendem e não imaginam o que os espera pela frente - disse
Elrond.
- Nem Frodo - disse Gandalf, inesperadamente apoiando Pippin. Nem qualquer um de nós pode
enxergar claramente. É verdade que se esses hobbits entendessem o perigo
não ousariam ir. Mas ainda assim desejariam ir, ou desejariam ousar, ficando
envergonhados e infelizes. Eu acho, Elrond. que nessa questão seria bom confiar mais
na grande amizade deles do que na grande sabedoria. Mesmo que escolha para nós um senhor
élfico, como Glorfindel, ele não poderia abalar a Torre Escura, nem abrir
a estrada que conduz ao Fogo, por meio dos poderes que tem.
- Você fala sério - disse Elrond -, mas estou em dúvida. O Condado, Pelo que pressinto,
não está livre de perigo; e pensei em mandar estes dois de volta como mensageiros,
para fazer o que pudessem, de acordo com as maneiras de sua terra, para advertir as
pessoas sobre o perigo que correm. De qualquer modo, julgo que o mais jovem dos
dois, Peregrin TU, deve Permanecer. Meu coração é contra sua partida.
#294
- Então, Mestre Elrond, o senhor terá de me acorrentar numa prisão,
ou me mandar para casa amarrado num saco - disse Pippin. - Pois, de outro modo, seguirei
a Comitiva.
- Então, que seja assim. Você irá - disse Elrond, e suspirou. - Agora a conta dos Nove
está completa. Em sete dias, a Comitiva deve partir.
A Espada de Elendil foi reforjada por ferreiros élficos, e na lâmina foi inscrito o
desenho de sete estrelas, colocadas entre a lua crescente e o sol raiado; em
volta delas foram escritas várias runas, pois Aragorn, filho de Arathorn, ia guerrear nas
fronteiras de Mordor. Muito brilhante ficou aquela espada depois de restaurada;
nela a luz do sol reluzia vermelha, e a luz da lua brilhava fria, e seu gume era
resistente e afiado. E Aragorn lhe deu um novo nome, chamando-a de Andúril, Chama
do Oeste.
Aragorn e Gandalf andavam juntos ou se sentavam, conversando sobre a estrada e os perigos
que encontrariam, e ponderando os mapas relatados e desenhados, e os livros
de estudo que havia na casa de Elrond. Algumas vezes, Frodo ficava junto, mas estava
satisfeito em apenas confiar na liderança deles, e passava o maior tempo possível
com Bilbo.
Nesses últimos dias, os hobbits se sentavam juntos, à noite, no Salão do Fogo, e entre
várias outras histórias ouviram a balada completa de Beren e Lúthien e da
conquista da Grande Jóia. Mas durante o dia, enquanto Merry e Pippin estavam dando voltas
pelo lugar, Frodo e Sam podiam ser encontrados com Bilbo, em seu pequeno
quarto. Nesses momentos, Bilbo lia passagens de seu livro (que ainda parecia bastante
incompleto), ou rascunhos de seus versos, ou tomava nota das aventuras de Frodo.
Na manhã do último dia, Frodo estava sozinho com Bilbo, e o velho hobbit puxou uma caixa
de madeira de debaixo da cama. Levantou a tampa e vasculhou dentro.
- Aqui está sua espada - disse ele. - Mas ela foi quebrada, você sabe.
- Peguei-a para guardá-la a salvo, e me esqueci de perguntar se os ferreiros podiam
consertá-la.
Agora não há tempo. Então pensei que talvez gostasse de levar esta, o que acha?

Tirou da caixa uma pequena espada, que estava dentro de uma bainha de couro velha e
desgastada. Então puxou-a, e a lâmina polida e bem cuidada reluziu de repente,
fria e clara. - Esta é Ferroada - disse ele, e enterrou-a fundo numa viga de madeira
quase sem nenhum esforço. - Leve-a, se quiser. Não vou precisar dela outra vez,
espero.
Frodo aceitou agradecido.
- Também há isto! - disse Bilbo, trazendo um pacote que parecia muito pesado em relação
ao tamanho. Desenrolou várias camadas de tecido velho e ergueu uma pequena
camisa de malha metálica, tecida com muitos
#295
anéis bem próximos uns dos outros, quase tão flexível como o linho, fria como gelo, e
mais resistente que o aço. Brilhava como a prata iluminada pela lua, e
estava adornada com pedras brancas, Com ela havia um cinto de pérolas e cristal.
- É bonita, não é? - disse Bilbo, erguendo-a contra a luz. - E útil. É a malha dos anões
que Thorin me deu. Peguei-a de volta em Grã Cava antes de partir, e a coloquei
na bagagem. Trouxe comigo todas as lembranças de minha Viagem, com exceção do Anel. Mas
não esperava usar esta, e não preciso dela agora, a não ser para olhá-la
algumas vezes. Você mal sente o peso quando a veste.
- Vou ficar.. bem, acho que vou ficar estranho usando isso - disse Frodo.
- Exatamente o que eu disse para mim mesmo - disse Bilbo. - Mas não se importe com as
aparências. Você pode usá-la embaixo da roupa. Vamos lá! Você tem de partilhar
este segredo comigo. Não diga para mais ninguém! Mas eu ficaria feliz em saber que você a
está usando. Imagino que ela entortaria até as espadas dos Cavaleiros Negros
- concluiu ele em voz baixa.
Muito bem, vou levá-la - disse Frodo. Bilbo o vestiu com a malha, e prendeu Ferroada no
cinto reluzente; então Frodo vestiu suas surradas calças, a túnica e o casaco.
- Você parece um simples hobbit - disse Bilbo. - Mas agora existe algo mais em você do
que aparece na superficie. Boa sorte! - Voltou-se e olhou pelajanela, tentando
entoar uma melodia.
- Não sei como agradecer, Bilbo, por isso, e por toda a gentileza de sempre - disse
Frodo.
- Não tente! - disse o velho hobbit, voltando-se e dando um tapinha nas costas de Frodo.
- Ai! - gritou ele. - Agora você está muito rígido para esses tapinhas!
Mas é isto: os hobbits devem permanecer juntos, principalmente os Bolseiros. Tudo o que
peço em retribuição é isto: cuide-se o máximo que puder, e traga todas as
notícias que conseguir. Farei o possível para terminar meu livro antes que volte.
Gostaria de escrever o segundo livro, se puder. - Interrompeu o que dizia e voltou-se
de novo para a janela, cantando baixinho.
Sentado ao pé do
fogo eu penso em tudo o que já vi,
flores do prado e borboletas, verões que já vivi;
As teias e as folhas amarelas de outonos de outros dias,
#296
com névoa e sol pela manhã, no rosto as aurasfrias.
Sentado ao pé do fogo eu penso no mundo que há de ser
com inverno sem primavera que um dia hei de ver
Porque há tanta coisa ainda
que nunca vi de frente:
em cada bosque, em cadafonte há um verde diferente.
Sentado ao pé do fogo eu penso
em gente que se defez,
e em gente que vai ver o mundo que não verei de vez.
Mas enquanto sentado penso em tanta coisa morta, atento espero pés voltando
e vozes junto à porta.

Era uma manhã fria perto do final de dezembro. O Vento Leste soprava através dos ramos
nus das árvores, agitando os escuros pinheiros sobre as montanhas. Nuvens
desmanchadas corriam no céu, altas e baixas. Quando as sombras soturnas da noite
começaram a cair, a Comitiva estava pronta para partir. Deviam começar a viagem
com a chegada do Crepúsculo, pois Elrond os havia aconselhado a seguir sob a proteção da
noite sempre que pudessem, até estarem longe de Valfenda.
- Vocês devem temer os muitos olhos dos servidores de Sauron - disse ele. - Não duvido de
que a notícia do desbaratamento dos Cavaleiros já tenha chegado até ele,
que deve estar tomado de ira. Em breve seus espiões estarão espalhados nas terras do
Norte, a pé e voando. Vocês devem se precaver até do céu que os cobre enquanto
avançam no caminho.
A Comitiva levou poucos equipamentos de guerra, pois a esperança que tinha estava
depositada no segredo, não na batalha. Aragom levou Andúril, e nenhuma outra arma,
e seguiu vestindo apenas suas surradas roupas verdes e marrons, como um guardião das
terras ermas. Boromir tinha
uma espada longa, semelhante à de Aragom, mas de
linhagem inferior, levando também um escudo e sua corneta de guerra.
#297
Ela soa alto e claro nos vales das colinas - disse ele - e assim faz
com que todos os inimigos de Gondor fujam! - Colocando-a nos lábios, emitiu um clangor,
cujos
ecos reverberaram de pedra em pedra, e todos que escutaram aquela voz em Valfenda
saltaram de pé.
- Você deve evitar tocar essa corneta novamente, Boromir - disse Elrond -, até que esteja
nas fronteiras da sua terra, e seja forçado por uma terrível necessidade.
- Talvez - disse Boromir. - Mas sempre toquei minha corneta antes de partir, e embora
daqui para frente devamos andar protegidos pelas sombras, não partirei como
um ladrão no meio da noite.
Apenas Gimli, o anão, vestia abertamente uma camisa curta de anéis de aço, pois os anões
não se importavam em carregar peso; no seu cinto estava um machado de
lâmina
larga. Legolas levava um arco e uma aljava, e no cinto uma faca comprida e branca. Os
hobbits mais jovens levavam as espadas que tinham trazido do túmulo, mas Frodo
só levou Ferroada; o casaco de malha metálica, conforme o desejo de Bilbo, permaneceu
escondido. Gandalf carregava seu cajado, mas amarrada ao longo de seu corpo
estava a espada élfica, Glamdring, companheira de Orcrist, que estava agora depositada
sobre o peito de Thorin,
embaixo da Montanha Solitária.
Elrond forneceu a todos roupas grossas e pesadas, e eles levavam também casacos e mantos
revestidos de pele. Roupas e mantimentos sobressalentes, juntamente com
cobertores e outros artigos necessários, seriam carregados por um pônei, exatamente o
pobre animal que tinham trazido de Bri.
A estada em Valfenda tinha operado uma mudança admirável nele: estava agora lustroso, e
parecia ter recuperado o vigor dajuventude. Foi Sam quem insistiu que o animal
fosse o escolhido, declarando que Bill (como o chamava) pereceria se fosse deixado para
trás.
- Aquele animal quase consegue falar - disse ele -, e falaria, se permanecesse aqui por
mais tempo. Lançou-me um olhar tão significativo quanto as palavras do Sr.
Pippin: se não me deixar ir com voce, Sam, vou seguilo por minha própria conta. - Desse
modo, Bill estava indo como animal de carga, e apesar disso era o único membro
da Comitiva que não demonstrava sinais de depressão.
As despedidas foram feitas no grande salão perto da lareira, e agora eles estavam apenas
esperando Gandalf, que ainda não tinha saído da casa.
O brilho do fogo das tochas vinha das portas abertas, e luzes suaves que
brilhavam nas várias janelas. Bilbo, embrulhado numa capa, estava quieto na Soleira da
porta

ao lado de Frodo. Aragom estava sentado com a cabeça tombada sobre os joelhos; apenas
Elrond entendia completamente o que aquela hora significava para ele. Os outros
podiam ser vistos como sombras cinzentas na escuridão.
#298
Sam esperava ao lado do pônei, chupando os dentes e olhando taciturno para o escuro onde
o
rio rugia sobre as pedras abaixo; seu desejo de aventura nunca estivera em maré tão
baixa.
- Bill, meu rapaz - disse ele -, você não precisava nos acompanhar. Podia ter ficado aqui
comendo o melhor feno até a grama nova nascer. Bill abanou o rabo e não
respondeu nada.
Sam ajeitou nos ombros o peso da mochila, relembrando ansiosamente todas as coisas que
tinha colocado nela, tentando pensar se tinha esquecido algo: o tesouro mais
precioso que carregava, seu equipamento de cozinhar, a pequena caixa com sal que ele
sempre carregava e enchia toda vez que podia, um bom suprimento de erva-de-fumo
(mas não o suficiente, eu garanto); pederneiras e material para alimentar o fogo, meias
de lã, roupas de baixo, vários pequenos pertences de seu patrão que este
esquecera e Sam tinha colocado na mochila para exibi-los em triunfo quando fossem
requisitados. Checou todos os itens.
- Corda! - murmurou ele. - Não está levando corda! E ontem à noite você disse a si mesmo:
"Sam, que tal um pedaço de corda? Você vai precisar, se não levar nenhum
consigo." Bem, vou precisar. Posso conseguir um pedaço agora.
Nesse momento, Elrond saiu com Gandalf, e chamou a Comitiva até ele. - Esta é minha
última palavra - disse ele em voz baixa. O Portador do Anel está partindo na Demanda da Montanha da Perdição. Apenas sobre ele
recaem exigências: de não se desfazer do Anel, nem entregá-lo a qualquer servidor do
Inimigo, nem sequer deixar
que qualquer pessoa o toque, com a exceção de membros da Comitiva e do Conselho, e mesmo
assim apenas em caso de extrema necessidade. Os outros partem com ele
como companheiros livres, para ajudá-lo no caminho. A vocês é permitido permanecer em
algum ponto, ou voltar, ou desviar por outros caminhos, como o destino permitir.
Quanto mais avançarem, mais difícil será recuar; apesar disso não lhes e impingido
qualquer juramento ou compromisso de continuar além do que estiverem dispostos.
Pois vocês ainda não conhecem a força dos próprios corações, e não podem prever o que
cada um vai encontrar na estrada.
- Desonesto é aquele que diz adeus quando a estrada escurece - disse Gimli.
- Talvez - disse Elrond -, mas nãojure que caminhará no escuro aquele que não viu o cair
da noite.
- Ainda assim, o juramento feito pode fortalecer o coração que treme
- disse Ginili.
- Ou destruí-lo - disse Eirond. - Não olhem muito à frente! Mas partam agora com coragem
nos corações! Adeus, e que a bênção dos elfos e
#299
dos homens e de todos os Povos Livres os acompanhe. Que as estrelas
brilhem em seus rostos!
Boa... boa sorte! - gritou Bilbo, tiritando de frio. - Não suponho que você consiga
escrever um
diário, Frodo, meu rapaz, mas vou estar esperando um relatório completo quando você
voltar. E não demore muito! Boa
viagem!
Muitos outros habitantes da casa de Elrond estavam nas sombras, e assistiam à partida da
Comitiva, dando-lhes adeus em voz baixa. Não houve riso, nem cançao ou musica.
Finalmente, fizeram uma curva e desapareceram, silenciosamente no crepúsculo.
Atravessaram a ponte e foram seguindo devagar ao longo dos caminhos íngremes que
conduziam para fora do profundo vale de Valfenda. Finalmente atingiram o pântano

alto, onde o vento chiava atravessando o urzal. Então, com um derradeiro olhar em direção
à última Casa Amiga que piscava no escuro, caminharam para dentro da noite.
No Vau do Bruinen, deixaram a Estrada e, rumando para o Sul, continuaram por uma passagem
estreita que cortava as dobras do solo.
O propósito deles era continuar nesse caminho a Oeste das Montanhas por muitas milhas e
dias.
A região era muito mais árida e deserta, comparada ao vale do Grande Rio que ficava nas
Terras Ermas,
do outro lado da cordilheira, e a caminhada seria lenta; mas assim esperavam escapar da
observação de olhos hostis. Os espiões de Sauron raramente tinham sido vistos
até aquele momento nessa região vazia, e os caminhos eram pouco conhecidos, a não ser
pelo povo de Valfenda.
Gandalf ia na frente, acompanhado por Aragorn, que conhecia a região até mesmo no escuro.
Os outros iam atrás em fila, e Legolas, que enxergava muito bem, ia na
retaguarda. A primeira parte da viagem foi dura e melancólica, e Frodo se lembraria muito
pouco dela, a não ser pelo vento. Por muitos dias sem sol, um vento gelado
soprou das Montanhas no Leste, e nenhuma roupa parecia capaz de impedir a penetração de
seus dedos ávidos. Embora a Comitiva estivesse bem agasalhada, raramente
se sentiam aquecidos, seja em movimento seja descansando. Dormiam mal acomodados no meio
do dia, em alguma cavidade do terreno, ou escondidos embaixo do emaranhado
de arbustos espinhosos que cresciam em moitas em vários lugares. No fim da tarde, eram
acordados pelo vigia, e faziam sua refeiçao principal: geralmente fria e triste,
pois raramente arriscavam acender uma fogueira. De noite, prosseguiam novamente,
escolhendo sempre o caminho que conduzisse a um ponto mais próximo do Sul.
Num primeiro momento, os hobbits tiveram a impressão- de que, embora caminhassem e
tropeçassem até se sentirem exaustos, estavam se
#300
arrastando como lesmas, sem chegar a lugar algum. A cada novo dia, a
região parecia ser a mesma do dia anterior. Mesmo assim, as montanhas chegavam cada vez
mais
perto. Ao Sul de Valfenda, elas se erguiam cada vez mais altas, e estendiam-se para o
Oeste; e perto do pé da cordilheira principal expandia-se uma região cada vez
mais ampla de colinas desoladas, e de vales profundos cheios de águas turbulentas. As
trilhas eram raras e tortuosas, freqüentemente conduzindo-os apenas até a beira
de alguma cascata íngreme, ou a pântanos traiçoeiros.
Já estavam havia duas semanas na estrada, quando o tempo mudou. o vento de repente
abrandou e tomou o rumo do Sul. As nuvens que passavam rápido subiram e se desmancharam;
o sol apareceu, pálido e límpido. Alvoreceu um dia frio e claro, ao final de uma longa e
dificil marcha noturna. Os viajantes atingiram uma cordilheira baixa, coroada
por antigos azevinhos cujos troncos, de um verde acinzentado, pareciam ser feitos da
mesma rocha das colinas. As folhas escuras brilhavam, e os frutos vermelhos
resplandeciam à luz do sol nascente.
Mais adiante, ao Sul, Frodo podia ver as formas apagadas de montanhas imponentes, que
pareciam agora obstruir o caminho que a Comitiva estava tomando. À esquerda
dessas montanhas altas assomavam três picos; o mais alto e mais próximo deles se erguia
como um dente coberto de neve; a encosta Norte, grande e deserta, ainda estava
em sua maior parte coberta pelas sombras, mas nos pontos em que o sol já podia
atingi-la via-se um brilho vermelho.
Gandalf parou ao lado de Frodo e olhou em volta, com a mão na testa.
- Saímo-nos bem - disse ele. - Chegamos aos limites da região que os homens chamam de
Azevim; muitos elfos viveram aqui em dias mais felizes, quando o nome deste
lugar era Eregion. Em linha reta, percorremos quarenta e cinco léguas, embora nossos pés
tenham percorrido muitas milhas mais. A região e o clima ficarão agora mais
amenos, mas talvez bem mais perigosos.
- Perigoso ou não, um nascer de sol de verdade é mais que bem-vindo

- disse Frodo, jogando para trás o capuz e permitindo que a luz da manhã batesse em seu
rosto.
- Mas as montanhas estão na nossa frente - disse Pippin. - Devemos ter rumado para o
Leste durante a noite.
- Não - disse Gandalf - Mas você enxerga mais longe na luz do dia. Depois desses picos, a
cordilheira faz uma curva em direção ao Sudoeste. Há muitos mapas na casa
de Elrond, mas acho que você nunca se deu ao trabalho de dar uma olhada neles.
- Fiz isso algumas vezes - disse Pippin. - Mas não me lembro de quase nada. Frodo tem uma
cabeça melhor para esse tipo de coisa.
#301
Não preciso de mapas - disse Gimli, que tinha alcançado Legolas, e estava olhando ao
redor com um brilho estranho nos olhos profundos. -Ali está a região em que
nossos pais trabalharam antigamente, e nós gravamos a figura dessas montanhas em muitos
trabalhos de metal e pedra, e em muitas canções e histórias. As três montanhas
se erguem altaneiras em nossos sonhos: Baraz, Zirak, Shathúr.
- Vi-as apenas uma vez, de longe, quando estava acordado, mas conheço as montanhas e seus
nomes, pois sob elas está
Khazad-dúm, a Mina dos Anões, que agora é chamada
de Abismo Negro, Moria na língua dos elfos. Mais além fica Baraziribar, o Chifre
Vermelho, o cruel Caradbras, e além dele ficam o Pico de Prata e o Cabeça de Nuvem:
Celebdil, o Branco, e Fanuidhol, o Cinzento, que nós chamamos de Zirakzigil e
Bundushathúr.
- Ali as Montanhas Sombrias se dividem, e entre seus braços fica o vale sombrio e
profundo que não conseguimos esquecer: AzanuIbizar, o Vale do Riacho Escuro, que
os elfos chamam de Nanduhirion.
- É para o Vale do Riacho Escuro que estamos indo - disse Gandalf.
- Se subirmos pela passagem que chamamos de Passo do Chifre Vermelho, sob a encosta mais
distante de Caradhras, desceremos através da Escada do Riacho Escuro, chegando
ao vale dos Anões. Ali fica o Lago-espelho, e naquele ponto o Veio de Prata jorra em suas
nascentes congeladas.
Escuras são as águas de Kheled-zâram - disse Girali -, e frias são as nascentes de Kibilnâla. Meu coração estremece quando penso que posso vê-los em breve.
- Que você se alegre com a vista, meu bom anão! - disse Gandalf Mas não importa o que
você faça, de modo algum podemos permanecer naquele vale. Precisamos descer
o Veio de Prata e penetrar nas florestas secretas, seguindo então para o Grande Rio, e
depois...
Ele parou.
- Sim, e depois? - perguntou Merry.
- Para o fim da viagem... finalmente - disse Gandalf - Não podemos contemplar um futuro
muito distante. Vamos nos contentar em pensar que o primeiro estágio foi
concluído com segurança. Acho que vamos descansar aqui, não só durante o dia, mas também
de noite. Existe um ar bentazejo em Azevim. Muita maldade precisa ocorrer
numa região antes que ela se esqueça dos elfos, se alguma vez foi habitada por eles.
- Isso é verdade - disse Legolas. - Mas os elfos dessa região eram de
uma raça estranha a nós, o povo da floresta, e as árvores e o capim não se recordam deles
agora. Só escuto as pedras lamentando por eles: escavaram-nos das profundezas,
moldaram-nos emfOrmas belas, construíram-nos em edéicios altos, mas seforam. Eles
se foram. Partiram em busca dos Portos há muito tempo.
#302
Naquela manhã, acenderam uma fogueira num fosso profundo, encopor grandes ramos de
azevinheiros, e a ceia matinal que fizeram foi
mais animada do que qualquer refeição desde que tinham partido.
e não tinham a intenção de continuar antes da noite do dia seguinte. Apenas Aragorn
estava inquieto e não dizia nada. Depois de uns momentos, abandonou a Comitiva

e caminhou até a crista; ali parou à sombra de uma árvore, olhando para o Sul e para o
Oeste, a cabeça numa postura de quem tentava escutar algo. Depois voltou até
a beirada do fosso, e olhou para baixo em direção aos outros, que estavam rindo e
conversando,
- Qual é o problema, Passolargo? - perguntou Merry. - O que está procurando? Está
sentindo falta do Vento Leste?
- Na verdade não - respondeu ele. - Mas sinto falta de alguma coisa. Já estive em Azevim
muitas vezes. Nenhum povo habita esta região atualmente, mas sempre houve
muitas outras criaturas, especialmente pássaros. No entanto, tudo está em silêncio agora,
com a exceção de vocês. Posso sentir. Não se escuta nenhum som por milhas
à nossa volta, e as suas vozes parecem fazer o chão ecoar. Não entendo.
Gandalf olhou para cima, num súbito interesse. - Mas qual você acha que é o
motivo?? - perguntou ele. - Existe alguma coisa além da surpresa de ver quatro hobbits,
para não mencionar o resto de nós, onde pessoas são tão raramente vistas OU ouvidas?
- Espero que seja só isso - respondeu Aragorn. - Mas sinto como se estivéssemos sendo
vigiados, e tenho uma sensação de medo que nunca senti aqui antes.
Então devemos ter cuidado - disse Gandalf.
Se você traz um guardião
numa viagem, é melhor prestar atenção ao que ele diz, especialmente se esse guardião é
Aragorn. Devemos parar de conversar em voz alta, descansar em silêncio e montar guarda.
Naquele dia, Sam foi o encarregado do primeiro turno da guarda, mas Aragorn o acompanhou.
Os outros adormeceram. Então o silêncio aumentou, a ponto de o próprio
Sam senti-lo. A respiração dos que dormiam podia ser claramente ouvida. A cauda do pônei
se agitando, e seus pés se movimentando ocasionalmente, produziam altos
ruídos. Sam podia escutar as próprias juntas rangendo quando se mexia. Um silêncio mortal
o envolvia, e sobre tudo estava um céu limpo e azul, à medida que o sol
subia do Leste. Ao Sul, na distância, uma mancha escura apareceu, e cresceu, dirigindo-se
para o Norte como fumaça levada pelo vento.
- O que é aquilo, Passolargo? Não parece uma nuvem - disse Sam a Aragorn num sussurro.
Este não respondeu; estava olhando para o céu com
grande atenção. Mas logo Sam pôde perceber por si mesmo o que se
aproximava.
#303
Bandos de pássaros, voando em grande velocidade, davam reviravoltas e descreviam
círculos,
atravessando toda a região como se procurassem alguma coisa; chegavam cada vez mais
perto.
Fique deitado e quieto! - sussurrou Aragorn, puxando Sam para o abrigo da sombra de um
azevinheiro, um regimento inteiro de pássaros tinha de repente se separado
do resto do batalhão e vinha, voando baixo, direto para a crista. Sam pensou que era uma
espécie de corvo de tamanho grande. Quando passaram por cima deles, numa
multidão tão densa que sua sombra os seguia escura sobre o chão, ouviu-se um grasnado
estridente.
Aragorn não se levantou antes que os pássaros tivessem desaparecido na distância, ao
Norte e ao Oeste, e o céu estivesse limpo outra vez. Então pulou de pé e foi
acordar Gandalf.
- Regimentos de corvos negros estão sobrevoando toda a região entre as Montanhas e o rio
Cinzento - disse ele. - Passaram sobre Azevim. Não são nativos desta região
são crebain originários de Fangorn e da Terra Parda, Não sei o que fazem aqui: talvez
haja algum problema no Sul do qual estão fugindo, mas acho que estão espionando
a região. Acho que devemos partir outra vez esta noite. Azevim não é mais um lugar seguro
para nós: está sendo vigiado.
- E nesse caso, o Passo do Chifre Vermelho também estará sendo observado - disse Gandalf.
- E não imagino como poderemos atravessá-lo sem sermos vistos. Mas vamos
pensar nisso quando chegar a hora. Quanto a partirmos ao escurecer, receio que esteja
certo.

- Ainda bem que nossa fogueira fez pouca fumaça, e o fogo ficou fraco antes que os
crebain viessem - disse Aragorn.
Devemos apagá-la. Não podemos acender mais
fogo algum.
- Ora, ora, tinha que aparecer essa praga! - disse Pippin, que recebeu a notícia - nada
de fogo, e a partida ao cair da noite - assim que acordou no final da tarde,
- Tudo por causa de um bando de corvos! Eu estava ansioso por uma refeição noturna de
verdade: algo quente.
- Bem, pode continuar ansioso - disse Gandalf. - Pode haver muitos banquetes inesperados
à sua frente. Quanto a mim, queria um cachimbo para fumar tranqüilo, e aquecer
os pés. Mas, de qualquer forma, podemos ter certeza de uma coisa: o clima vai ficar mais
quente conforme nos
aproximarmos do Sul.
- Quente demais, imagino - murmurou Sam para Frodo. - Mas estou começando a achar que já
era hora de vermos aquela Montanha de Fogo, e o fim da Estrada, por assim
dizer. Primeiro pensei que esse Chifre Vermelho aqui, ou qualquer que seja seu nome,
poderia ser a Montanha de Fogo,
sei o que fazern aqui: talvez haja algum problema no Sul do qual estão fugindo, mas acho
que estão espionando
a região. Acho que devemos partir outra vez esta noite. Azevirn não é mais um lugar
seguro para nós: está sendo vigiado.
E nesse caso, o Passo do Chifre Vermelho tarribém estará sendo observado - disse Gandalf.
- E não imagino como poderemos atravessá-lo sem sermos vistos, Mas vamos
pensar nisso quando chegar a hora. Quanto a partirmos ao escurecer, receio que esteja
certo.

até que Gimli fez aquele discurso. Essa língua dos anões deve ser um belo quebra-queixo!
- Os mapas não significavam nada para a mente de Sam, e todas as distâncias
naquelas terras estranhas pareciam tão vastas que ele não tinha a menor noção do que
dizia.
Durante todo o dia, a Comitiva permaneceu escondida. Os pássaros negros sobrevoaram
o lugar onde estavam várias e várias vezes, mas, à medida que o sol descia
no Oeste e se avermelhava, desapareceram em direção ao Sul. Ao cair da noite, a Comitiva
partiu e, rumando um pouco mais para o Leste, dirigiram-se para Caradhras,
que ao longe ainda brilhava com um vermelho apagado, na última luz do sol que
desaparecia. Uma a uma, estrelas brancas irrompiam no céu que se apagava.
Guiados por Aragorn, descobriram uma boa trilha. Frodo teve a impressão de que era o que
restava de
uma estrada antiga, que havia sido larga e bem planejada, conduzindo

de Azevim até a passagem da montanha. A lua, agora cheia, subiu sobre as montanhas,
lançando uma luz pálida, sob a qual as sombras das rochas ficaram negras. Muitas
delas pareciam ter sido construídas a mão, embora agora estivessem decadentes e
arruinadas,
numa região desolada.
Era aquela hora fria que antecede os primeiros sinais da aurora e a lua estava baixa.
Frodo olhou para o céu. De repente, viu ou sentiu uma sombra passando sobre
as estrelas altas, como se por um instante elas se apagassem e depois
brilhassem de novo. Um tremor percorreu-lhe o corpo.
Você viu alguma coisa passando? - sussurrou ele para Gandalf, que ia logo à frente.
- Não, mas senti algo, seja lá o que for - respondeu ele. - Pode ser apenas uma
nuvenzinha fina.
- Então essa nuvem passou bem rápido - murmurou Aragorn. - E não foi o vento que a
carregou.
Nada mais aconteceu
naquela noite. A manhã seguinte surgiu ainda mais clara que a
anterior. Mas o ar estava frio de novo; o vento já estava voltando em direção
ao leste. Por mais duas noites, continuaram a marcha, subindo sem parar, mas cada vez
mais lentamente. conforme a estrada galgava a montanha descrevendo curvas,
e as montanhas assomavam, cada vez mais próximas. Na terceira manhã, Caraffiras se erguia
diante deles: um pico enorme, coberto de neve branca como a prata, mas
com encostas nuas e íngremes, de UM vermelho apagado, como se estivessem manchadas de
sangue.
O céu tinha uma aparência sombria, e o sol estava pálido. O vento tinha mudado de rumo,
soprando agora do Nordeste. Gandalf sentiu o ar e olhou para trás.
- O inverno avança às nossas costas - disse ele em voz baixa para Aragorn. -As Montanhas
no Norte estão mais brancas que antes; a neve já
#305
desce pelas suas encostas. Esta noite devemos nos dirigir para cima, para o passo do
Chifre Vermelho. É possível que sejamos vistos por vigias naquela passagem estreita,
e algum perigo pode estar nos esperando; mas o clima pode acabar sendo um inimigo mais
fatal que qualquer outro. Que caminho acha que devemos tomar agora, Aragorn?
Frodo ouviu essas palavras, e percebeu que Gandalf e Aragorn estavam continuando alguma
discussão que havia começado muito antes. Continuou escutando, ansiosamente.
- Não posso ver nada de bom em nosso caminho, Gandalf, do início ao fim, como você bem
sabe - respondeu Aragorn. - E os perigos, conhecidos e desconhecidos, vão
aumentar conforme prosseguirmos. Mas precisamos continuar, e não será bom adiar a
passagem pelas montanhas. Mais para o Sul, não há passagens, até se chegar ao
Desfiladeiro de Rohan. Não confio naquele caminho, desde que você trouxe a notícia sobre
Saruman.
Quem pode dizer agora a que lado os oficiais dos Senhores dos
Cavalos estão servindo?
- É verdade, ninguém pode saber! - disse Gandalf - Mas há outro caminho, que não é pela
passagem de Caradhras: o caminho escuro e secreto, do qual já falamos.
- Mas não vamos falar nele outra vez! Não por enquanto. Não diga nada aos outros, eu lhe
peço, não até que fique claro que não há outra saída. Precisamos decidir
antes de continuar - respondeu Gandalf.
Então vamos ponderar o assunto em nossas mentes, enquanto os outros descansam e dormem disse Aragorn.
No fim da tarde, enquanto os outros terminavam seu desjejum, Gandalf e Aragorn foram
juntos para um lado, e ficaram olhando para
Caradhras. As encostas estavam
escuras e sombrias, e o pico se escondia em meio a nuvens cinzentas. Frodo os observava,
tentando adivinhar para qual lado a discussão penderia. Quando voltaram,
Gandalf falou, e assim Frodo soube que a decisão fora enfrentar o clima e a passagem
alta. Ficou aliviado. Não podia adivinhar qual era o outro caminho secreto e

escuro, mas a simples menção dele parecera causar grande consternação a Aragorn, e Frodo
ficou feliz que tal caminho tivesse sido abandonado.
- Pelos sinais que temos Visto ultimamente - disse Gandalf -, receio que o Passo do
Chifre Vermelho possa estar sendo vigiado, também tenho dúvidas sobre o clima
que está vindo atrás de nós. Pode nevar. Devemos ir a toda velocidade possível. Mesmo
assim, serão duas marchas até poderMOS atingir o topo da passagem. Vai escurecer
cedo esta noite. Devemos partir assim que se aprontarem.
- Vou acrescentar um conselho, se me for permitido - disse Boromir. Eu nasci sob as
sombras das Montanhas Brancas, e sei alguma coisa
#306
sobre viagens em lugares altos. Vamos deparar com um frio rigoroso, se não com coisas
piores, antes de descermos do outro lado. De nada vai adiantar viajarmos tão
secretamente e morrermos congelados. Quando deixarmos este lugar, onde ainda existem
algumas árvores e arbustos, cada um de nós deve levar um feixe de lenha, o maior
que puder carregar.
- E Bill poderia levar mais um pouco, não poderia, rapaz? - disse Sam.
O pônei lançou-lhe um olhar pesaroso.
- Muito bem - disse Gandalf. - Mas não devemos usar a lenha - a não ser que tenhamos de
escolher entre o fogo e a morte.
A Comitiva partiu de novo, em boa velocidade no início, mas logo o caminho ficou íngreme
e dificil. Em alguns pontos, a estrada tortuosa e inclinada tinha quase
desaparecido, e estava bloqueada por muitas pedras caídas. A noite ficou totalmente
escura sob grandes nuvens. Um vento forte fazia rodamoinhos por entre as rochas.
Por volta de meia-noite, eles tinham alcançado a parte mais baixa das grandes montanhas.
A trilha estreita agora se torcia sob uma parede inclinada de encostas
à esquerda, sobre as quais os flancos austeros de Caradhras se erguiam, invisíveis na
escuridão; à direita ficava um abismo de escuridão, no qual a própria terra
caia para dentro de um precipício fundo.
Com muito esforço, subiram a encosta angulosa, e pararam por uns minutos no topo. Frodo
sentiu um toque suave em seu rosto. Estendeu a mão e viu os flocos de neve,
de um branco apagado, caindo-lhe sobre a manga da roupa.
Continuaram. Mas logo a neve começou a cair mais densa, enchendo todo o ar, rodando
perante os olhos de Frodo. As figuras escuras e curvadas de Gandalf e Aragorn,
apenas um ou dois passos à frente, mal podiam ser vistas.
- Não gosto disso nem um pouco - disse Sam ofegante, logo atrás dele. - Tudo bem termos
neve numa manhã agradável, mas gosto de ficar na cama enquanto ela está
caindo. Gostaria que esta aqui fosse para Vila dos Hobbits! As pessoas poderiam gostar de
neve lá. - A não ser nos pântanos altos da Quarta Norte, era raro cair
uma grande quantidade de neve no Condado, e quando isso acontecia o fato era considerado
agradável, e era
uma oportunidade de diversão. Nenhum hobbit vivo (exceto
Bilbo) conseguia se lembrar do Inverno Mortal de 1311, quando os lobos brancos invadiram
o Condado através do Brandevin congelado.
Gandalf parou. A neve se espessava sobre seu capuz e ombros; as botas afundavam nela até
a altura dos tornozelos.
- Era isto que eu temia - disse ele. - Que me diz agora, Aragorn?
- Que também temia isto - respondeu ele -, mas temia menos que outras coisas. Eu sabia do
risco da neve, embora ela raramente caia assim
#307
tão pesada aqui no Sul, a não ser nas montanhas altas. Mas ainda não
subimos muito, ainda estamos bem embaixo, onde as trilhas geralmente ficam abertas
durante
todo o inverno.

- Pergunto se isso não é um artificio do Inimigo - disse Boromir. Dizem na minha terra
que ele pode governar tempestades nas Montanhas da Sombra, que ficam nas
fronteiras de Mordor. Tem poderes estranhos e muitos aliados.
- O braço dele realmente cresceu - disse Gimli -, se ele pode trazer a neve do Norte para
nos atrapalhar aqui, a trezentas léguas de distância.
- O braço dele cresceu - disse Gandalf.
Enquanto estavam ali parados, o vento cessou, e a neve foi diminuindo, até quase parar.
Continuaram aos tropeços. Mas não tinham avançado mais que duzentos metros
quando a tempestade retornou, com fúria renovada. O vento assobiava, e a tempestade se
transformou numa nevasca que não permitia ver nada. Logo, até mesmo Boromir
começou a encontrar dificuldades para prosseguir. Os hobbits, curvados quase até o chão,
avançavam a duras penas atrás dos maiores, mas ficava cada vez mais claro
que não poderiam ir muito mais além se a neve continuasse. Os pés de Frodo
pesavam como chumbo. Pippin se arrastava atrás. Até mesmo Gimli, robusto como um anão
COStUma ser, resmungava ao caminhar penosamente.
A Comitiva parou de repente, como se tivesse chegado a um acordo sem dizer qualquer
palavra. Ouviram ruídos sinistros na escuridão que os envolvia. Podia ter sido
apenas um truque do vento nas rachaduras e fendas da parede rochosa, mas o som era
semelhante ao de gritos agudos e gargalhadas alucinadas. Pedras
começaram a cair da encosta da montanha, zunindo sobre suas cabeças, ou batendo contra a
trilha ao lado deles. De tempo em tempo, ouviam um rumor abafado, e uma
enorme pedra
descia rolando das alturas ocultas acima deles.
- Não podemos continuar esta noite - disse Boromir. - Quem quiser chamar isto de vento
que chame, mas há vozes fatais no ar, e essas pedras estão sendo arremessadas
em nossa direção.
- Eu chamo de vento - disse Aragorn. - Mas isso não invalida o que você disse. Há muitos
seres malignos e hostis no mundo, que têm
pouco amor por aqueles que andam
sobre duas pernas, e mesmo assim não são al aliados de Sauron, mas têm os próprios
propósitos. Alguns estão no mundo há
mais tempo que ele.
- Caradhras foi chamado de o Cruel, e tinha um nome maligno - disse Gimli -, há muitos
anos, quando rumores sobre Sauron ainda não tinham sido Ouvidos por estas
terras.
- Pouco importa quem seja o inimigo, se não pudermos vencer seu ataque - disse Gandalf.
#308

- Mas que podemos fazer? - gritou Pippin arrasado. Apoiava-se em Merry e Frodo, e tremia.
- Ou parar onde estamos, ou voltar - disse Gandalf. - Não adianta continuar.
Um pouco mais acima, se me recordo direito, esta trilha abandona a encosta e penetra
num valo raso e largo, ao pé de uma ladeira longa e difícil. Ali não teremos abrigo da
neve, ou das pedras - ou de qualquer outra coisa.
- E não adianta irmos em frente enquanto a tempestade persistir disse Aragorn. - Não
passamos por lugar algum nesta subida que oferecesse mais abrigo que a parede
deste penhasco, sob o qual estamos.
- Abrigo! - murmurou Sam. - Se isto for abrigo, então uma parede e nenhum telhado fazem
uma casa.
A Comitiva agora se mantinha o mais perto possível do penhasco. O penhasco dava para o
Sul, e perto da base se inclinava um pouco para fora, de modo que assim esperavam
ter alguma proteção do vento Norte e das pedras que caíam. Mas rajadas formavam
rodamoinhos por toda a volta, e a neve caía em nuvens ainda mais densas.
Aconchegaram-se uns aos outros, com as costas contra a parede. BilI, o pônei, ficou
parado na frente dos hobbits, paciente, mas desanimado, protegendo-os um pouco.
Mas logo a neve já lhe cobria os jarretes, e subia cada vez mais. Se não tivessem
companheiros maiores, os hobbits seriam logo inteiramente enterrados.

Uma grande sonolência tomou conta de Frodo, que se sentia afundar rapidamente num sonho
quente e nebuloso. Imaginava que um fogo lhe aquecia os pés, e das sombras
do outro lado da lareira vinha a voz de Bilbo falando. Esperava coisa melhor de seu
diário, dizia ele. Nevasca no dia 12 de Janeiro: não precisa va voltar para
contar isso!
Mas eu precisava descansar e dormir, Bilbo, respondeu Frodo com esforço, quando sentiu
que alguém o sacudia, e acordando a contragosto. Boromir o havia desenterrado
de um monte de neve.
- Isto será a morte dos pequenos, Gandalf - disse Boromir. - É inútil permanecermos aqui
até que a neve cubra nossas cabeças. Precisamos fazer alguma coisa que nos
salve!
- Dê-lhes isto - disse Gandalf, remexendo em sua mochila e retirando um odre de couro. Apenas um gole para cada um - cada um de nós. É muito precioso. É
miruvor,
o licor de Imladris. Recebi de Elrond quandO nos despedimos. Passe uma rodada.
Logo que Frodo engoliu um pouco da bebida quente e aromática sentiu nova coragem, e a
sonolência pesada abandonou seus braços e pernas. Os outros
também se reanimaram e sentiram renovada esperança e vigor.
#309
Mas a neve não abrandou. Caía ao redor, mais espessa que nunca, e o vento soprava mais
forte.
- Que me diz de fogo? - perguntou Boromir de súbito. - A escolha agora parece ser entre o
fogo e a morte, Gandalf Sem dúvida estaremos escondidos de todos os olhos
hostis quando a neve nos cobrir, mas isso não nos ajudará em nada.
- Você pode fazer uma fogueira, se conseguir - respondeu Gandalf. Se houver espiões que
agüentem esta tempestade, então eles poderão nos ver, com ou sem fogo.
Mas embora tivessem trazido lenha e gravetos a conselho de Boromir, estava além das
habilidades dos elfos, e até mesmo dos anões, acender uma chama que pudesse vingar
em meio àquele turbilhão de vento, e que pudesse acender o combustível molhado.
Finalmente, com relutância, o próprio Gandalf deu uma ajuda. Pegando um feixe de
lenha, segurou-o no alto por um momento, e então com um comando naur an edraith aninien!
empurrou a ponta do cajado no meio da lenha. Imediatamente, grandes chamas
verdes e azuis se precipitaram numa fogueira, e a lenha flamejou e estalou.
Se houver alguém para ver, então pelo menos eu me revelei a eles disse ele. - Escrevi
Gandalf está aqui em sinais que podem ser lidos desde Vallenda até a foz do
Anduin.
Mas a Comitiva não se preocupava mais com espiões ou olhos hostis. Seus corações estavam
deliciados em ver a luz do fogo. A lenha queimava alegremente, e embora
por toda a volta a neve chiasse, e poças de gelo derretido se formassem sob seus pés,
eles conseguiam aquecer as mãos na chama com prazer. Ali ficaram, agachados
num círculo em volta das pequenas labaredas dançantes e reluzentes. Uma luz brilhava nos
rostos cansados e ansiosos; atrás deles, a noite era como uma parede negra.
Mas a lenha queimava rapido, e a neve ainda caía.
A fogueira foi diminuindo, e o último feixe foi jogado nela.
- A noite está acabando - disse Aragorn. - A aurora não tarda a chegar.
- Isso se alguma aurora conseguir romper essas nuvens - disse Gimli. Boromir afastou-se
do círculo e olhou para a escuridão. - A neve está enfraquecendo - disse
ele - e o vento está abrandando.
Frodo olhou com cansaço para os flocos que ainda caíam da escuridão, para se revelarem
brancos por um momento à luz do fogo que se extinguia, mas por um bom tempo
não pôde ver qualquer sinal de que diminuiam. Então, de repente, ao sentir o sono começar
a dominá-lo outra vez, teve consciência de que o vento estava realmente
abrandando, e de que os flocos estavam maiores e mais raros. Muito devagar, uma luz fraca
comeÇou a crescer. Finalmente, a neve parou de cair completamente.

A medida que ficava mais forte, a luz revelava um mundo silencioso e encoberto. Abaixo do
refúgio onde estavam, havia cúpulas e montes brancos e profundezas informes
abaixo dos quais a trilha que tinham pisado estava totalmente perdida; mas os picos acima
deles estavam ocultos em grandes nuvens, ainda pesadas com a ameaça de
neve.
Gimli olhou para cima e balançou a cabeça. - Caradhras não nos perdoou - disse ele. - Ele
ainda tem mais neve para lançar sobre nós, se prosseguirmos. Quanto mais
rápido descermos e voltarmos, melhor.
Com isso todos concordaram, mas a retirada agora era dificil. Podia muito bem ser
impossível. A apenas alguns passos das cinzas da fogueira, a neve subia a uma altura
significativa, além das cabeças dos hobbits; em alguns pontos, tinha sido carregada e
empilhada pelo vento em montes contra o penhasco.
- Se Gandalf se dispusesse a ir à frente com uma chama forte, Poderia derreter a neve e
fazer
uma trilha para vocês - disse Legolas. A tempestade quase não o incomodara,
e só ele de toda a Comitiva ainda permanecia tranqüilo.
Se os elfos pudessem voar sobre montanhas, poderiam trazer o sol para nos salvar respondeu Gandalf. - Mas preciso de algum material para trabalhar. Não posso
queimar a neve.
- Bem
disse Boromir, quando cabeças estão perdidas, corpos devem
servir, como dizemos em minha terra.
O mais forte de nós deve procurar um caminho. Vejam!
Apesar de tudo agora estar coberto de neve, nossa trilha, quando subimos, fez uma curva
naquela saliência rochosa lá embaixo. Foi ali que a neve começou a pesar
demais. Se pudéssemos chegar àquele ponto, talvez ficasse mais fácil prosseguir. Não fica
a mais de duzentos metros de distância, eu acho.
- Então vamos forçar uma trilha até ali, você e eu - disse Aragorn. Aragorn era o mais
alto da Comitiva,
mas Boromir, pouco mais baixo, era mais atarracado e tinha
uma constituição mais forte. Ele foi na frente, seguido por Aragorn. Lentamente foram
indo, e logo estavam andando com bastante dificuldade. Em alguns lugares,
a neve subia à altura dos ombros, e freqüentemente Boromir parecia estar nadando ou
cavando com os braços, em vez de andar.
Legolas os observou por uns momentos COM UM sorriso nos lábios, e então voltou-se para os
outros. - Os mais fortes devem procurar um caminho, vocês dizem" Mas eu
digo: deixe um lavrador arar, mas escolha uma lontra para nadar, e para correr leve sobre
capim e folha ou sobre a neve - um elfo.
Com isso, pulou para frente com agilidade, e então Frodo notou pela primeira vez, embora
soubesse disso há muito tempo, que o elfo não estava usando botas,
mas apenas sapatos leves, como sempre fazia, e que seus pés quase não deixavam marcas na
neve.
#311
- Até a volta! - disse ele a Gandalf - Vou encontrar o sol! - Então,
rápido como um corredor sobre terra firme, ele disparou, e logo alcançando os homens que
se arrastavam, com um aceno de mão os ultrapassou, e correu na distância,
desaparecendo atrás da curva rochosa.
Os outros esperaram aconchegados uns aos outros, observando até que Boromir e Aragorn
foram se transformando em manchas negras naquela brancura. Finalmente, eles
também desapareceram de vista. O tempo passava lentamente. As nuvens desceram e agora
alguns flocos de neve
começaram a cair rodopiando novamente.
Uma hora, talvez, tenha se passado, embora parecesse muito mais, e então finalmente viram
Legolas voltando. Ao mesmo tempo, Boromir e Aragom reapareceram na curva
muito atrás dele, e subiram a ladeira com esforço.

- Bem - disse Legolas, enquanto subia correndo -, eu não trouxe o sol. Ele está andando
nos campos azuis do Sul, e uma pequena coroa de neve nesse montinho do Chifre
Vermelho não o preocupa nem um pouco. Mas eu trouxe de volta uma chama de esperança para
aqueles que se destinam a andar a pé. Logo após a curva, há o maior monte
de neve que o vento pôde acumular. Ali nossos Homens Fortes quase foram soterrados.
Ficaram desesperados, até que voltei e lhes disse que o monte era pouco mais
espesso que uma parede. E do outro lado a neve diminui de repente, e mais abaixo não
passa de uma coberta branca para refrescar os pés dos hobbits.
- É como eu falei - disse Gimli. - Não foi uma tempestade comum, É a má vontade de
Caradhras. Ele não gosta de elfos e anões, e aquela neve foi acumulada para impedir
que escapássemos.
- Mas, felizmente, seu Caradhras esqueceu que você tem Homens por companhia - disse
Boromir, que chegava naquele instante. - E homens fortes, se me permite dizer;
embora homens mais fracos com pás talvez fossem mais úteis. Mesmo assim, cavamos um
caminho por entre o monte de neve, e por isso podem ficar agradecidos todos aqui
que não podem correr com a leveza dos elfos.
- Mas como desceremos até lá, mesmo que vocês tenham feito um caminho no meio da neve? disse Pippin, expressando o pensamento de todos os hobbits.
- Tenham esperança! - disse Boromir. - Estou cansado, mas ainda me resta alguma força, e
a Aragorn também. Carregaremos os pequenos. Os outros, sem dúvida, podem
se arranjar pisando na trilha atrás de nós. Venha, Mestre Peregrin! Começo com você.
Ele levantou o hobbit. - Pendure-se nas minhas costas! Vou precisar de meus braços disse ele avançando. Aragorn e Merry foram atrás. Pippin
ficoumaravilhado com a força de Boromir, vendo a passagem que tinha aberto apenas com
seus braços e pernas. Mesmo agora, carregado como
#312
estava, ia alargando a trilha para os que vinham atrás, jogando para os lados a neve
enquanto prosseguia.
Finalmente chegaram ao grande monte de neve. Fora arremessado sobre a trilha da montanha
como uma parede abrupta e íngreme, e seu topo, agudo como se apontado por
facas, tinha duas vezes a altura de Boromir; mas no meio uma passagem tinha sido aberta,
subindo e descendo como uma ponte. Do outro lado Meriry e Pippin foram colocados
no chão, e ali esperaram com Legolas que o resto da Comitiva chegasse.
Depois de um tempo, Boromir voltou carregando Sam. Atrás, na trilha estreita mas agora
bem marcada, veio Gandalf, conduzindo Bill com
Gimli empoleirado na bagagem.
Por último veio Aragorn carregando Frodo. Atravessaram a passagem, mas Frodo mal tinha
colocado os pés no chão quando, com um rumor profundo, desabou um monte de
pedras e uma porção de neve, que subiu pulverizada e cegou parcialmente a Comitiva por
uns momentos. Eles se agacharam contra o penhasco, e, quando o ar ficou limpo
novamente, viram que a passagem atrás deles estava bloqueada.
Basta! Basta! - gritou Gimli. - Estamos indo embora o mais rápido possível! - E de fato,
com aquele último golpe, a malícia da montanha pareceu se esgotar, como
se Caradhras estivesse satisfeito com a derrota dos invasores e em saber que não iriam
retornar. A ameaça da neve sumiu no céu; as nuvens começaram a se abrir e
a luz ficou mais intensa.
Como Legolas tinha dito, eles viram que a neve ficava cada vez mais baixa conforme
desciam, de modo que até os hobbits podiam caminhar novamente. Logo todos eles
pisavam mais uma vez na saliência rochosa plana que ficava no alto da ladeira íngreme,
onde tinham sentido os primeiros flocos de neve na noite anterior.
A manhã agora já avançava. Daquele lugar alto, olharam para trás em direção ao Oeste, por
sobre as regiões mais baixas. Na distância, no trecho de terra que ficava
no pé da montanha, estava o valezinho do qual tinham saído para subir pela trilha.
As pernas de Frodo doiam. Estava congelado até os ossos e faminto; sua cabeça rodava ao
pensar na marcha longa e dolorosa colina abaixo. Manchas negras flutuavam
diante de seus olhos. Esfregou-os, mas as manchas negras persistiam. Na distância

abaixo dele, mas ainda bem acima das bases das colinas mais baixas, pontos pretos
faziam círculos no ar.
- Os pássaros outra vez - disse Aragorn, apontando para baixo.
- Não podemos evitar agora - disse Gandalf - Quer sejam bons ou maus, ou quer não tenham
nada a ver conosco, devemos descer imediatamente. Nem mesmo nas partes mais
baixas de Caradhras devemos esperar outra noite cair!
Um vento frio soprava atrás deles, enquanto davam as costas para o Passo do Chifre
Vermelho, e iam aos tropeços ladeira abaixo.
Caradhras os derrotara.

CAPíTULO IV
UMA JORNADA NO ESCURO

A tarde já terminava, e a luz cinza outra vez se apagava rápido, quando pararam para
descansar. Sentiam-se muito cansados. As montanhas estavam veladas pelo crepúsculo
cada vez mais escuro. Gandalf permitiu que tomassem mais um pouco do miruvor de Valfenda.
Depois de comerem alguma coisa, ele convocou uma reunião.
- É claro que não podemos continuar esta noite - disse ele. - O ataque no Passo do Chifre
Vermelho nos deixou exaustos, e precisamos descansar um pouco aqui.
- Então, que devemos fazer?
-Ainda temos a viagem e nossa missão pela frente - respondeu Gandalf.
- Não temos outra escolha a não ser prosseguir, ou voltar para Valfenda.
O rosto de Pippin se iluminou visivelmente à simples menção do retorno a Valfenda.
Merry e Sam levantaram os olhos, cheios de esperança. Mas Aragorn e Boromir não fizeram
nenhum sinal. Frodo parecia confuso.
- Gostaria de voltar para lá - disse ele. - Mas como posso voltar sem
me sentir envergonhado - a não ser que realmente não haja outra saída, e já estejamos
derrotados?
- Você está certo, Frodo - disse Gandalf - Voltar seria admitir a derrota, e enfrentar
uma derrota ainda maior. Se voltarmos agora, o Anel deverá
permanecer lá:
não poderemos partir outra vez. Então, mais cedo ou mais tarde, Valfenda seria cercada, e
depois de um tempo curto e amargo, destruída. Os Espectros do Anel são
inimigos mortais, mas são ainda apenas sombras em comparaçao ao poder e terror que
possuiriam se o Anel Governante caísse outra vez nas mãos de seu mestre.
- Então devemos prosseguir - disse Frodo com um suspiro. Sam mergulhou num enorme
desânimo.
- Existe um caminho que podemos tentar - disse Gandalf- Desde o inicio. quando comecei a
considerar esta viagem, pensei que deveríamos tentá-lo. Mas não é um caminho
agradável, e não o mencionei à Comitiva antes. Aragorn era contra, até que a passagem
através das montanhas fosse pelo menos tentada.
- Se é uma estrada ainda pior que o Passo do Chifre Vermelho, então é realmente maligna disse Merry- - Mas é melhor que você fale dela, e nos Permita conhecer
o pior imediatamente.
- A estrada de que falo conduz às Minas de Moria - disse Gandalf. Apenas
Gimli levantou a cabeça, com fogo nos olhos. Um terror tomou conta
#314
dos outros, à menção daquele nome. Até mesmo para os hobbits, Moria era uma lenda que
trazia um vago medo.
- A estrada pode conduzir a Moria, mas como podemos saber se nos conduzirá através de
Moria? - disse Aragorn com uma expressão sombria.

- Este não é um nome de bom agouro - disse Boromir. - Nem vejo a necessidade de irmos
para
lá. Se não podemos atravessar as montanhas, vamos viajar para o Sul, até atingirmos o
Desfiladeiro de
Rohan, onde os homens são amigos
de meu povo, e depois podemos pegar a estrada pela qual cheguei até aqui. Ou podemos ir
além e atravessar o Isengard, chegando à Praia Comprida e Lebermin, e dessa forma
chegar a Gondor pelas regiões próximas ao mar.
- As coisas mudaram desde que você veio do Norte, Boromir - respondeu Gandalf. - Não
ouviu o que eu contei sobre Saruman? Com ele, tenho coisas a resolver antes
que tudo esteja acabado. Mas o Anel não deve chegar perto de Isengard. se de alguma forma
isso puder ser evitado.
O Desfiladeiro de Rohan está fechado para nós, enquanto acompanharmos o Portador.
- Quanto à estrada mais longa, não dispomos de tempo. Poderíamos passar
um ano viajando, e teríamos de passar por muitas regiões que estão desertas e não possuem
portos. Mesmo assim, não seriam seguras. Os olhos atentos de Saruman e do Inimigo estarão
espreitando. Quando você veio para o Norte, Boromir, aos olhos do Inimigo
pareceu apenas um viajante perdido vindo do Sul, e um assunto de pouca importância para
ele: sua mente estava ocupada em procurar o Anel. Mas agora você retorna
como um membro da Comitiva do Anel, e correrá perigo enquanto permanecer conosco.
O perigo crescerá a cada légua que nos aproximarmos do Sul sob o céu aberto.
- Desde nossa tentativa declarada na passagem da montanha, nossa situação ficou mais
desesperadora, eu receio. Agora vejo poucas esperanças, se logo não desaparecermos
de vista por um período, ou cobrirmos nossa trilha. Portanto, aconselho que não sigamos
nem através das montanhas, e que nem as contornemos. Essa estrada de que
falo é, pelo menos, a que o Inimigo menos espera que tomemos.
- Não sabemos o que ele espera - disse Boromir. - Pode estar vigiando todas as estradas,
as prováveis e as improváveis. De qualquer forma, entrar em Moria seria
andar para dentro de uma armadilha, pouco melhor que bater nos portões da própria Torre
Escura.
O nome de Moria é negro.
- Você está falando do que não sabe, quando compara Moria à fortaleza de Sauron respondeu Gandalf. - Só eu aqui já estive nas masmorras do Senhor do Escuro, e
mesmo assim, apenas na sua antiga moradia em Dol Guldur. Aqueles que atravessam os
portões de Barad-dúr não retornam. Mas eu não os conduziria a Moria a não ser
que houvesse esperança de sairmos
#315
de lá. Se houver orcs lá, é claro que podemos nos dar mal. Mas a maioria dos
orcs das Montanhas Sombrias foi dispersada ou destruída na Batalha dos Cinco Exércitos.
As Águias relatam que os orcs estão se reunindo de novo, vindos de longe, mas existe a
esperança de que Moria ainda esteja livre.
- É até possível que os anões estejam lá, e que em algum salão profundo de seus pais
possamos encontrar Balin, filho de Fundin.
O que quer que aconteça, é preciso trilhar o caminho escolhido pela necessidade!
- Vou trilhar o caminho ao seu lado, Gandalf. - disse Gimli. - Vou procurar nos salões de
Durin, não importa o que esteja esperando lá - se você conseguir encontrar
as portas que estão fechadas.
- Muito bom, Gimli - disse Gandalf. - Você me encoraja. Vamos encontrar juntos as portas
trancadas. E vamos atravessá-las. Nas ruínas dos anões, a cabeça de um anão
tem menos chance de se confundir do que as dos elfos, homens ou hobbits. Não será a minha
primeira visita a Moria. Por um longo tempo, estive lá procurando
Thráin, filho de Thrór, depois que ele desapareceu. Atravessei as Minas, e saí outra vez,
vivo.
Eu também atravessei o Portão do Riacho Escuro certa vez - disse Aragorn em voz baixa. Mas, embora também tenha saído vivo, as lembranças são muito maléficas.
Não gostaria de entrar em Moria uma segunda vez.

E eu não gostaria de entrar lá nem uma vez - disse Pippin.
Nem eu - murmurou Sam.
É claro que não - disse Gandalf. - E quem gostaria? Mas a pergunta é a seguinte: quem vai
me seguir, se eu for para lá?
- Eu vou - disse Gimli cheio de vontade.
Eu vou - disse Aragorn numa voz pesada. - Você seguiu minha liderança na neve, que quase
acabou em desastre, e não teve uma palavra para me reprovar. Seguirei agora
a sua liderança - se este último aviso não o demover. Não é no Anel, nem em nós aqui que
estou pensando agora, mas em você, Gandalf E digo a você: se passar pelas
portas de Moria, tome cuidado!
- Eu não vou - disse Boromir. - A não ser que o voto de toda a Comitiva
esteja contra mim. Que dizem Legolas e as pessoas pequenas? É evidente que a voz do
Portador
do Anel deve ser ouvida.
Não quero ir para Moria - disse Legolas.
Os hobbits não disseram nada. Sam olhou para Frodo. Finalmente, Frodo falou. - Não quero
ir - disse ele. - Mas também não quero recusar o conselho de Gandalf. Peço
que não haja votação, antes que tenhamos dormido um pouco. Será mais fácil votar na luz
da manhã do que nessa escuridão fria. Como os ventos uivam!
Ao ouvir essas palavras, todos caíram num silêncio profundo. Escutavam o vento chiar por
entre os rochedos e árvores, e havia uivos e lamentos ao redor deles, nos
espaços vazios da noite.
#316
De repente, Aragorn se pôs de pé. - Como os ventos uivam - gritou ele. - Uivam como o
uivar dos lobos. Os
wargs se deslocaram para o Oeste das Montanhas!
- Então precisamos esperar pela manhã - disse Gandalf - É como eu digo. A caçada está em
ação! Mesmo que vivamos para ver a aurora, quem agora gostaria de viajar
para o Sul de noite, com os lobos selvagens atrás de nós?
- A que distância fica Moria? - perguntou Boromir.
- Havia uma porta, a Sudoeste de Caradhras, a cerca de quinze milhas
num vôo de pássaro, e talvez vinte numa corrida de lobos - disse Gandalf austero.
- Então vamos partir logo que a luz apareça amanhã, se pudermos disse Boromir. O lobo que se escuta é pior que o orc que se teme.
- É verdade - disse Aragorn, soltando a espada na bainha. - Mas onde o
warg uiva, os orcs também rondam.
- Gostaria de ter obedecido o conselho de Elrond - murmurou Pippin para Sam. - Afinal de
contas, não sou
bom o suficiente. Não há em mim muito do sangue, de Bandobras,
o Urratouro: esses uivos congelam meu sangue. Não me lembro de ter-me sentido tão
desgraçado.
Meu coração já está nos pés, Sr. Pippin - disse Sam. - Mas ainda não fomos devorados, e
existem algumas pessoas fortes aqui conosco.
O que quer que esteja reservado para o velho Gandalf, aposto que não é a barriga de um
lobo.
Como defesa durante a noite, a Comitiva subiu ao topo da pequena colina sob a qual
estiveram abrigados. Estava coberto por um emaranhado de árvores velhas e retorcidas,
ao redor das quais ficava um círculo interrompido, feito de pedras. No centro fizeram uma
fogueira, já que não havia esperanças de que a escuridão e o silêncio impedissem
que sua trilha fosse descoberta por bandos de animais caçadores.
Sentaram-se ao redor da fogueira, e os que não estavam de guarda cochilaram inquietos.
O pobre pônei, BilI, de pé, tremia e suava. Os uivos dos lobos agora estavam
por toda a volta, algumas vezes mais próximos, outras mais distantes. Na calada da noite,
muitos olhos brilhantes foram vistos espiando sobre a saliência da colina.
Alguns avançaram quase até o círculo de pedras. Numa falha do círculo podia-se ver uma
forma grande e escura de lobo, parada, observando-os. Soltou um uivo de arrepiar,

como se fosse um capitão chamando sua tropa para o assalto.
Gandalf levantou-se e avançou, segurando seu cajado no alto. - Escute, Cão de Sauron! gritou ele. - Gandalf está aqui. Fuja, se der valor à sua pele asquerosa!
Vou murchar você do rabo até o focinho, se ousar pôr as patas neste círculo,
#317
o lobo rosnou e avançou em direção a eles com um grande salto. Nesse momento, ouviu-se um
zunido agudo. Legolas tinha disparado seu arco. Houve um grito medonho,
e a figura que saltava caiu no chão com um som abafado; a flecha élfica tinha-lhe
perfurado a garganta. Os olhos que espiavam desapareceram de repente. Gandalf e
Aragorn andaram mais à frente, mas a colina fora abandonada; o bando de animais caçadores
tinha fugido. Em toda a volta, a escuridão ficou silenciosa, e nenhum
grito foi trazido no suspirar do vento.
A noite já estava terminando, e no Oeste a lua minguante descia, brilhando vacilante por
entre as nuvens que se desmanchavam. De repente, Frodo despertou de seu
sono. Sem avisar, uma tempestade de uivos soou, feroz e alucinada, por toda a volta do
acampamento. Um grande bando de
wargs tinha-se reunido em silencio, e agora os atacava por todos os lados de uma vez.
- joguem lenha na fogueira - gritou Gandalf para os hobbits. Peguem suas espadas e fiquem
uns de costas para os outros.
Na luz trémula, quando a lenha nova se acendeu num clarão, Frodo viu muitas formas
cinzentas pularem por sobre o círculo de pedras. Muitas outras as seguiram. Na
garganta de um líder corpulento, Aragorri enterrou sua espada; com um grande impulso,
Boromir decepou a cabeça de um outro. Ao lado deles, Gimli se postava com
as robustas pernas abertas, brandindo seu machado de anão. O arco de Legolas cantava.
Na luz inconstante do fogo, Gandalf pareceu crescer de repente: ergueu-se, numa grande
figura ameaçadora, como o monumento de algum rei antigo de pedra, colocado
sobre uma colina. Agachando-se como uma nuvem, ele levantou um feixe em chamas e caminhou
em direção aos lobos, que recuaram. Jogou o feixe flamejante no ar a uma
grande altura, A lenha fulgurou numa radiação súbita e branca, semelhante a um raio, e
ouviu-se sua voz, estrondosa como um trovão.
- Naua an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth! - gritou ele. Houve um estrondo e um
estalo, e a árvore sobre ele explodiu em
folhas e botões de fogo que cegavam
os olhos. O fogo atingiu, uma a uma, as copas das árvores. Toda a colina estava coroada
por uma luz ofuscante. As espadas e facas dos defensores brilhavam e faiscavam.
A última flecha de Legolas se acendeu em chamas quando cruzou o ar, e queimando atingiu o
coração de um grande chefe dos lobos. Todos os outros fugiram.
Lentamente, o fogo foi se extinguindo, até não sobrar nada além de cinzas e brasas; uma
fumaça amarga se enrolava sobre os troncos das árvores, subindo da colina,
escura, enquanto a primeira luz da aurora aparecia pálida no céu. Os inimigos tinham sido
expulsos e não retornaram.
#318
- O que eu disse ao senhor, Sr. Pippin? - disse Sam, embainhando sua espada. - Os lobos
não vão pegar o Sr.
Gandalf. Aquilo foi um aviso, sem dúvida! Quase chamuscou
meu cabelo!
Quando a luz da manhã apareceu completamente, não se viam sinais dos lobos, e eles
procuraram em vão os corpos dos mortos. Nenhum vestígio da fuga permanecia, a
não ser pelas árvores carbonizadas e as flechas de Legolas espalhadas
pelo topo da colina. Todas estavam perfeitas, exceto uma, da qual só sobrara a ponta.
- É como eu temia - disse Gandalf. - Estes não eram lobos comuns, caçando comida no ermo.
Vamos comer rápido e partir!
Naquele dia, o tempo mudou de novo, quase como se estivesse sob o comando de um poder que
não via mais utilidade na neve, já que a Comitiva tinha-se retirado da

passagem, um poder que desejava agora uma luz clara, na qual os seres que se movessem nas
terras desertas pudessem ser vistos de longe.
O vento estivera mudando seu curso de Norte para Noroeste durante a noite, e agora tinha
parado. As nuvens desapareceram em direçào ao Sul,
O Céu se abria, alto e azul. Quando pararam na encosta da colina, prontos para
partir, a luz pálida do sol reluzia sobre os topos das montanhas,
- Temos de chegar às portas antes do pôr-do-sol - disse Gandalf -, ou receio que não
possamos chegar até elas de forma alguma. Não é longe, mas nosso caminho pode
ser cheio de curvas, pois nesta região Aragorn não pode nos guiar, raramente ele andou
por aqui, e apenas uma vez eu estive sob a parede Oeste de Moria, e isso foi
há muito tempo.
- Ali está a estrada - disse ele, apontando para o Sudeste, onde as encostas das
montanhas desciam íngremes até a sombra de seus pés. Na distância, via-se uma
fileira apagada de penhascos nus, e no meio deles, mais alta que o resto, uma grande
parede cinzenta. - Quando deixamos a passagem, levei vocês na direção Sul, e
não de volta ao ponto de partida, como alguns de vocês podem ter notado. Foi bom que fiz
isso, pois agora
temos muito menos milhas a atravessar, e estamos com
pressa. Vamos!
- Não sei o que desejar - disse Boromír, austero, - Que Gandalf encontre o que procura,
ou que chegando ao penhasco encontremos os
portões perdidos para sempre.
Todas as escolhas parecem ruins, e sermos capturados entre os lobos e a parede parece a
chance mais provável. Vá na frente!
Gimli agora caminhava ao lado do mago. de tão ansioso que estava por chegar em Moria,
Juntos conduziam a Comitiva de volta, em direção às montanhas . A comprida
estrada que antigamente conduzia a Moria vindo do Oeste se estendia ao longo do curso de
um rio, o Sirarmon, que saía da base dos penhascos, perto de onde ficavam
as portas. Mas, ou Gandalf estava perdido
#319
ou então o terreno tinha mudado nos últimos anos, pois ele não atingiu o rio onde
esperava encontrá-lo, apenas a algumas milhas de onde tinham partido.
A manhã já avançava em direção ao meio-dia, e ainda a Comitiva vagava aos tropeços num
terreno deserto de pedras
vermelhas. Em nenhum lugar puderam ver qualquer
brilho de água ou ouvir o som dela. E tudo estava desolado e seco. Sobreveio o desânimo.
Não viam nenhum ser vivo, e não havia sequer um pássaro no céu; mas o que
a noite traria, se os pegasse naquela terra perdida, nenhum deles queria pensar.
De repente, Gimli, que se tinha apressado à frente dos outros, voltou-se, chamando-os,
Estava em pé sobre um rochedo, e apontava para a direita. Subindo depressa,
eles viram lá embaixo um canal fundo e estreito. Estava vazio e silencioso, e apenas um
fio de água corria entre as pedras do leito, manchadas de vermelho e marrom;
mas na margem mais proxima havia uma trilha, bastante obstruida e estragada, que seguia
seu caminho desenhando curvas, por entre as paredes e as pedras que pavimentavam
uma antiga estrada.
- Ah! Aqui está finalmente! - disse Gandalf. - É aqui que o rio corria.
Sirannon, o Riacho do Portão, costumavam chamá-lo. Mas o que aconteceu à água, não posso
imaginar, costumava ser veloz e ruidosa. Venham! Precisamos nos apressar! Estamos
atrasados.
A Comitiva tinha os pés doloridos e todos estavam cansados; mas foram caminhando com
dificuldade ao longo da trilha acidentada e tortuosa por muitas milhas.
O sol já descia em direção ao Oeste. Depois de uma parada rápida e uma refeição
apressada, partiram novamente. Diante deles, as montanhas se erguiam severas, mas
a
trilha pela qual seguiam se estendia sobre um vaio fundo, e eles só conseguiam ver as
saliências mais altas, e os picos distantes ao Leste.

Finalmente, atingiram uma curva fechada. Ali a estrada, que antes estivera desviando seu
curso para o Sul, entre a borda do canal e uma queda abrupta do terreno
a esquerda, virava e voltava a rumar para o Leste. Contornando a curva, eles
viram adiante um penhasco baixo, de uns dez metros de altura, com o topo quebrado em
várias pontas, Por ele um fio de água escoava aos pingos, através de uma fenda larga que
parecia ter sido formada por uma cachoeira que havia sido antes forte e
caudalosa.
- De fato, as coisas mudaram! - disse Gandalf - Mas não há duvida quanto ao lugar. Ali
está tudo o que sobrou da Cachoeira da Escada. Se me lembro bem, havia um
lance de degraus cortados na rocha ao lado, mas a estrada principal contornava pela
esquerda e subia dando várias voltas até a Planicie no topo.
Havia um vale raso além da cachoeira, que conduzia direto
#320
para as Muralhas de Moria, e o Sirarmon corria ao lado, acompanhado pela estrada. Vamos
ver como as coisas estão agora!
Encontraram os degraus de pedra sem dificuldade, e Gimli os subiu rapidamente, seguido
por Gandalf e Frodo. Quando chegaram ao topo, perceberam que não poderiam
continuar por ali, e a razão para a extinção do riacho foi revelada. Atrás deles, o sol
que se punha enchia o frio céu do Oeste de ouro reluzente. À frente, se espalhava
um lago escuro e parado. Nem o céu, nem o pôr-do-sol refletiam-se em sua superficie
sombria.
O Sirarmon tinha sido represado, e suas águas enchiam agora todo o vale.
Além da água agourenta erguiam-se vastos penhascos, cujas encostas austeras estavam
pálidas na luz minguante: impossíveis de se atravessar. Frodo não pôde ver qualquer
sinal de portão ou entrada, nem uma fissura ou fenda na rocha hostil.
- Ali estão as Muralhas de Moria - disse Gandalf, apontando em direção à outra margem da
água. - E ali ficava o Portão, outrora, a Porta Élfica no final da estrada
que vinha de Azevim, pela qual viemos. Mas este caminho está bloqueado. Ninguém da
Comitiva, eu acho, estaria disposto a nadar nessa água sombria no fim do dia.
Tem uma aparência maligna.
- Devemos achar uma passagem contornando a encosta Norte - disse Gimli. - A primeira
coisa que a Comitiva tem a fazer é escalar pelo caminho principal e ver aonde
ele nos conduzirá. Mesmo que não houvesse o lago, não poderíamos levar nosso pônei com as
bagagens por esta escada.
- Mas de qualquer modo, não podemos levar o pobre animal para dentro das Minas - disse
Gandalf. O caminho sob as montanhas é um caminho escuro, e há lugares estreitos
e íngremes pelos quais ele não poderá passar, mesmo que nós consigamos.
- Pobre Bill - disse Frodo. - Não tinha pensado nisso. E pobre Sam! Fico pensando no que
ele vai dizer.
- Sinto muito - disse Gandalf - O pobre Bill tem sido um companheiro útil, e corta meu
coração pensar que devemos soltá-lo agora. Eu preferia ter viajado com menos
bagagens e não ter trazido animal algum, e menos ainda este, do qual Sam gosta tanto, se
tivesse podido escolher. Durante todo o tempo receei que teríamos de tomar
esta estrada.
O dia chegava ao fim, e estrelas frias cintilavam no céu acima do sol poente, quando a
Comitiva, na maior velocidade possível, subia as encostas e atingia a margem
do lago. Sua largura parecia não ultrapassar quatrocentos ou seiscentos metros no ponto
mais amplo. A que distância ele se estendia em direção ao Sul não podiam
ver na luz que se apagava, mas a extreinidade Norte não ficava a mais de meia milha de
onde estavam, e entre as
bordas rochosas que envolviam o vale e a beira da água havia um trecho de

chão aberto. Todos se apressaram, pois tinham ainda uma ou duas milhas para caminhar
antes de chegarem ao ponto na margem oposta, para o qual candalf se dirigia;
depois disso, ele ainda teria de encontrar as portas.
Quando chegaram ao ponto mais distante do lado Norte do lago, encontraram um riacho
estreito que lhes barrava o caminho. Era verde e estagnado, estendido como um
braço limboso em direção às colinas que cercavam o lugar. Gimli foi à frente sem medo, e
descobriu que a água era rasa, chegando apenas à altura dos tornozelos
na beirada. Atrás dele, foram todos em fila, pisando com cuidado, pois sob as poças
cobertas de vegetação havia pedras escorregadias e pisar ali era perigoso. Frodo
estremeceu enojado, ao sentir o toque da água suja em seus pés.
No momento em que Sam, o último da Comitiva, conduzia o pônei para o terreno seco do
outro lado, houve um ruído baixo: um zunido, seguido de outro barulho, como
se algo tivesse caído na água, ou como se um peixe tivesse perturbado a superficie parada
da água. Voltando-se rápido, viram ondas, negras sob a luz que enfraquecia:
grandes círculos se expandiam a partir de um ponto distante dentro do lago. Houve um
barulho de bolhas, e depois silêncio. A escuridão aumentava, e os últimos brilhos
do sol foram velados por nuvens.
Gandalf agora forçava um passo rápido, e os outros o seguiam o mais rápido que
conseguiam. Alcançaram a tira de terra seca entre o lago e os penhascos: era estreita,
geralmente de uma largura que não chegava a doze metros, e cheia de rochas e pedras
caídas; mas eles encontraram um caminho, agarrando-se ao penhasco, e mantendo
a maior distância possível da água escura. Uma milha mais ao Sul ao longo da praia,
encontraram azevinhos. Tocos e ramos mortos apodreciam nas partes mais rasas;
ao que parecia, restos de antigas moitas, ou de uma cerca-viva que certa vez teria
emoldurado a estrada através do vale submerso. Mas próximas ao penhasco ainda
havia, fortes e vivas, duas árvores altas, mais altas que qualquer azevinheiro que Frodo
jamais tinha visto ou imaginado. As grandes raizes se espalhavam da rocha
até a água. Sob os imponentes penhascos, tinham parecido meros arbustos, quando vistas à
distância, do topo da Escada. Mas agora se erguiam acima das cabeças, rígidas,
escuras e silenciosas, jogando profundas sombras noturnas em volta de seus pés, eretas
como pilares feito sentinelas no final da estrada.
- Bem, finalmente estamos aqui - disse Gandalf. - Aqui termina o Caminho dos Elfos de
Azevim. O Azevinho era o símbolo do povo daquela terra, e eles o plantaram
aqui para marcar o fim de seu domínio, pois a Porta Oeste foi feita principalmente para
ser usada por eles em seu comérCio com os Senhores de Moria. Aqueles foram
dias mais felizes, quando havia ainda uma forte amizade entre povos de raças diferentes,
até mesmo entre anões e elfos.
#322
- Não foi por culpa dos anões que a amizade acabou - disse Gimli.
- Nunca soube que tenha sido culpa dos elfos - disse Legolas.
- Ouvi as duas coisas - disse Gandalf -, e não vou fazer um julgamento agora. Mas peço a
vocês dois, Legolas e
Gimli, que pelo menos sejam amigos, e que me ajudem.
Preciso de ambos. As portas estão fechadas e escondidas, e quanto mais rápido as
encontrarmos, melhor. A noite está chegando.
Voltando-se para os outros, ele disse: - Enquanto procuro, vocês poderiam se aprontar
para entrar nas Minas? Pois aqui receio que devamos dizer adeus ao nosso bom
animal de carga. Devem deixar de lado a maior parte das coisas que trouxemos contra o
clima mais rigoroso: não vão precisar delas lá dentro, e nem, espero, quando
tivermos atravessado e avançarmos para o Sul. No lugar dessa bagagem, cada um de vocês
deve pegar uma parte do que o pônei vinha carregando, especialmente a comida
e os frascos de água.
- Mas não podemos deixar o pobre e velho Bill para trás neste lugar abandonado, Sr.
GandalP. - gritou Sam, furioso e aflito. - Não vou permitir isso, e ponto final!
Depois de ele ter vindo até aqui e tudo mais!

- Sinto muito, Sam - disse o mago. - Mas quando a Porta se abrir, acho que você não vai
conseguir puxar o seu Bill para dentro. Terá de
escolher entre Bill e seu patrão.
Ele seguiria o Sr. Frodo até dentro da caverna de um dragão, se eu permitisse - protestou
Sam. - Não faria nenhuma diferença matá-lo ou soltá-lo aqui, com todos
esses lobos rondando.
- Espero que faça alguma diferença - disse Gandalf, colocando a mão sobre a cabeça do
pônei, e falando em voz baixa. - Vá e leve consigo palavras de proteção e orientação
- disse ele. - Você é um animal sábio, e aprendeu muito em Valfenda. Faça seu caminho por
lugares onde possa achar capim, e desse modo chegue em tempo à casa de
Elrond, ou a qualquer lugar aonde deseje ir.
- Olhe, Sam! Ele vai ter exatamente a mesma chance que nós de escapar dos lobos e chegar
em casa.
Sam ficou parado obstinadamente ao lado do pônei, sem responder nada.
Bill, parecendo entender bem o que estava acontecendo, aproximou-se dele, colocando o
focinho
perto da orelha de Sam. Sam rompeu em lágrimas, soltando as correias e descarregando
todas as mochilas do pônei, jogando-as no chão. Os outros escolheram as coisas,
fazendo uma pilha de tudo o que poderia ser deixado para trás, e dividindo o resto entre
si.
Quando terminaram de fazer isso, voltaram-se para Gandalf. Ele parecia não ter feito
nada. Estava parado entre as duas árvores, olhando fixamente a parede lisa
do penhasco, como se fosse perfurá-la com os olhos. Gimli andava de um lado para o outro,
batendo na pedra aqui e ali com seu machado.
#323
Legolas se encostava contra a parede, como se tentasse escutar alguma coisa.
- Bem, aqui estamos nós, todos prontos - disse Merry. - Mas onde estão as Portas? Não
vejo qualquer sinal delas.
- As Portas dos Anões não são feitas para ficarem visíveis quando fechadas - disse
Gimli. - São invisiveis, e nem mesmo seus donos podem encontrá-las ou abri-las,
se seu segredo for esquecido.
- Mas esta Porta não foi feita para ser um segredo conhecido apenas pelos anões - disse
Gandalf, de repente voltando ao normal e virando-se para os outros. - A não
ser que as coisas estejam completamente mudadas, olhos que sabem o que procurar podem
encontrar os sinais.
Andou para frente, em direção à parede. Exatamente no meio da sombra das árvores havia
uma superfície lisa, sobre a qual ele passou suas mãos de um lado para o outro,
murmurando palavras num tom baixo. Então recuou outra vez.
- Olhem! - disse ele. - Podem ver alguma coisa agora?
A lua agora brilhava sobre a face cinza da pedra; mas os outros não puderam ver mais nada
por um tempo. Então, lentamente, sobre a superfície, onde as mãos do mago
tinham passado, linhas claras apareceram, como veias finas de prata correndo na pedra. No
início, não passavam de uma teia de prata, tão fina que apenas piscava
oscilante nos pontos onde a luz da lua batia, mas gradativamente as linhas ficavam mais
largas e visiveis, até que se pôde adivinhar o desenho que formavam.
Na parte superior, numa altura que o braço de Gandalf podia alcançar, via-se um arco de
letras entrelaçadas, letras que pertenciam à língua dos elfos. Abaixo, embora
as linhas estivessem em alguns pontos borradas e quebradas, podia-se ver o contorno de
uma bigorna e um martelo, abaixo de uma coroa com sete estrelas. Abaixo destas
estavam duas árvores, cada uma carregando luas crescentes, Mais nítida que todo o resto
brilhava, bem no meio da porta, uma única estrela com muitas pontas.
- Lá estão os emblemas de Durin! - gritou Gimli.
E ali está a Árvore dos Altos-elfos! - disse Legolas.
E a Estrela da Casa de Fêanor - disse Gandalf - Estão gravados em ithildin, que reflete
apenas a luz do sol e a da lua, e fica adormecido até que seja tocado por

uma pessoa que pronuncie palavras há muito esquecidas na Terra-média. Faz tempo que as
ouvi, e tive de pensar muito antes de trazê-las de volta à mente.
- Que diz a inscrição? - perguntou Frodo, que tentava decifrar a inscriÇão no arco, Pensei conhecer as letras dos elfos, mas não consigo ler estas.
- As palavras estão na língua élfica do Oeste da Terra-média dos Dias
Antigos - respondeu Gandalf. - Mas não dizem nada de importante para
#324
(Gravura do Portal)
#325
nós. Dizem apenas: As Portas de Durin, Senhor de Moria.
Fale, amigo, e entre. E
abaixo está escrito, em letras pequenas e apagadas: Eu, Narvi, as
fiz. Celebribor de Azevim desenhou estes sinais.
Que quer dizer a frase fale, amigo, e entre? - perguntou Merry.
- Exatamente isso! - disse Gimli. - Se você é amigo, pronuncie a palavra secreta, e as
portas se abrirão, e você poderá entrar.
- Sim - disse Gandalf -, estas portas provavelmente são comandadas por palavras. Alguns
dos portões dos anões só se abrem em ocasiões especiais, apenas para pessoas
determinadas, e alguns ainda têm fechaduras e chaves que são indispensáveis, mesmo quando
as ocasiões e as palavras necessárias são conhecidas. Estas portas não
têm chave. Nos dias de Durin, não eram secretas. Geralmente ficavam abertas, e guardas
ficavam aqui a postos. Mas se estivessem fechadas, qualquer um que conhecesse
a palavra correta poderia pronunciá-la e entrar. Pelo menos assim registrou a história,
não é,
Gimli?
- É sim - disse o anão. - Mas ninguém se lembra da palavra. Narvi, seu ofício e todo seu
povo desapareceram da terra.
Mas você sabe a palavra, Gandalf? - perguntou Boromir surpreso.
Não! - disse o mago.
Os outros olharam desolados; apenas Aragorn, que conhecia bem Gandalf, permaneceu em
silêncio e imóvel.
- Então, de que adiantou nos trazer até este ponto maldito? - gritou Boromir, voltando-se
para olhar a água com um calafrio. - Disse-nos que uma vez tinha passado
através das Minas. Como pode ser, se você não sabia como entrar?
A resposta à sua primeira questão, Boromir - disse o mago -, é que eu não sei a palavra ainda. Mas logo veremos. E - acrescentou ele com um brilho nos olhos sob
as sobrancelhas grossas - você pode perguntar qual a utilidade de meus feitos quando eles
demonstram ser inúteis. Quanto à sua segunda pergunta: duvida do que contei?
Ou não lhe sobra nenhuma inteligência? Eu não entrei por aqui. Vim pelo Leste.
- Se quiser saber, vou dizer que essas portas se abrem para fora. De dentro, pode-se
abri-las com as mãos. De fora, nada poderá movê-las, a não ser o encanto de
comando. Não se pode forçá-las para dentro.
- Que vai fazer então? - perguntou Pippin, não se assustando com as sobrancelhas grossas
do mago.
- Bata nas portas com a cabeça, Peregrin Túk - disse Gandalf - Mas se isso não as
abalar, e se me permitirem um pouco de paz, sem perguntas tolas, procurarei as
palavras para abri-la.
- Certa vez eu sabia todos os encantamentos em todas as línguas, de elfos, homens ou
orcs, que eram usados para esse propósito. Ainda posso
#326
lembrar um grande número desses encantamentos sem ter de vasculhar minha mente. Mas serão
necessárias apenas algumas tentativas, eu acho, e não precisarei chamar

Gimli para lhe perguntar as palavras secretas dos anões que eles não ensinam a ninguém.
As palavras secretas eram élficas, como a inscrição no arco: isso parece
certo.
Voltou-se para o rochedo outra vez, e tocou de leve com o cajado a estrela de prata que
ficava no meio, abaixo do sinal da bigorna.
Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lamment!,
disse ele numa voz de comando. As linhas de prata desapareceram, mas a pedra cinzenta não
se moveu.
Muitas vezes repetiu essas palavras em ordem diferente, ou variando-as. Então tentou
outros encantamentos, um após o outro, falando algumas vezes mais rápido e alto,
outras vezes baixo e devagar. Depois pronunciou mUitas palavras isoladas, da língua dos
elfos. Nada aconteceu.
O penhasco se erguia na escuridão, as incontáveis estrelas estavam acesas, o vento
soprava frio, e as portas continuavam cerradas.
Mais uma vez, Gandalf se aproximou da parede rochosa, e levantando a voz falou em tons de
comando e ira crescente.
Edro, edro! gritava ele, e batia na pedra com
o cajado. Abra, abra! berrou, e pronunciou o mesmo comando em todas as línguas que já
tinha falado no Oeste da Terra-média. Depois jogou o cajado no chão e sentou-se
em silêncio.
Naquele momento, o vento começou a trazer, de um ponto distante, até seus ouvidos
atentos, o uivo de lobos. Bill, o pônei, teve um sobressalto, e
Sam pulou para
perto dele, sussurrando baixinho aos seus ouvidos.
- Não o deixe fugir! - disse Boromir. - Parece que vamos precisar dele ainda, se os lobos
não nos acharem. Como eu odeio esse lago nojento! Abaixou-se e, pegando
uma pedra grande, jogou-a longe para dentro da água escura.
A pedra desapareceu com um ruído abafado, mas, no mesmo instante, ouviu-se um zunido e
água borbulhando. A superficie da água se encrespou em grandes círculos, que
se originavam no ponto onde a pedra havia caído, e que se aproximavam lentamente do pé do
penhasco.
- Por que fez isso, Boromir? - perguntou Frodo. -Também odeio este lugar, e estou com
medo. Não sei do quê: não é dos lobos, ou do escuro que nos espera atrás das
portas, mas de alguma outra coisa. Tenho medo do lago. Não o incomode!
- Gostaria que pudéssemos sair deste lugar - disse Merry.
#327
- Por que Gandalf não faz alguma coisa logo? - disse Pippin. Gandalf não prestava atenção
neles. Estava sentado, com a cabeça
curvada. ou em desespero ou num pensamento ansioso. ouviu-se outra vez o uivo
lamentoso dos lobos. Os círculos na água cresciam e chegavam mais perto; alguns já batiam
contra a margem.
Num rompante, assustando a todos, o mago pulou de pé. Estava rindo!
- Consegui! - gritou ele. - É claro, é claro! Absurdamente simples, como a maioria dos
enigmas quando você descobre a resposta.
Pegando o cajado, parou diante da porta e disse numa voz clara: Mellon! A estrela brilhou
por uns instantes e desapareceu outra vez. Então, silenciosamente, surgiu
o contorno de um grande portal, embora nenhuma fenda ou fissura estivesse visível antes.
Dividiu-se ao meio e se abriu para fora, pouco a pouco, até que ambas as
portas se encostaram contra a parede rochosa. Através da abertura, podia-se ver uma
escada sombria, subindo inclinada; mas além dos degraus mais baixos, a escuridão
era mais profunda que a noite. A Comitiva observava, estupefata.
- No fim, eu estava errado - disse Gandalf. - E Gimli também. Merry, quem diria, estava
na pista certa. A palavra secreta estava inscrita no arco o tempo todo!
A tradução correta era: Diga "Amigo" e entre. Eu só tinha de pronunciar a palavra élfica
correspondente a amigo e as portas se abririam. Simples demais para um erudito

mestre nas tradições nestes dias suspeitos. Aqueles eram tempos mais felizes. Agora
vamos!
Foi na frente, e colocou o pé no primeiro degrau. Mas, nesse momento, várias coisas
aconteceram. Frodo sentiu algo agarrá-lo pelo tornozelo, e caiu com um grito.
Bill, o pônei, soltou um relincho alucinado de medo e, virando-se, disparou margeando o
lago, para dentro da escuridão. Sam se atirou no encalço dele e então, ouvindo
o grito de Frodo, correu de volta, gritando e praguejando. Os outros se voltaram e viram
as águas do lago fervilhando, como se um exército de serpentes viesse nadando
da extremidade sul.
Um longo e sinuoso tentáculo tinha saído da água; era de um verde-claro, luminoso e
úmido. A extremidade em forma de dedos prendera o pé de Frodo, e agora o arrastava
para dentro da água. Sam, de joelhos, golpeava a garra com uma faca.
O braço soltou Frodo, e Sam o puxou para fora, gritando por socorro. Vinte outros braços
apareceram, avançando na direção dele e se agitando. A água escura fervia,
e um cheiro medonho se espalhava no ar.
- Para dentro! Subam a escada! Rápido! - gritou Gandalf, pulando para trás. Despertandoos do terror que parecia ter aprisionado ao solo os Pés de todos, com a exceção
de Sam, conduziu-os adiante.
#328
Quase não deu tempo. Sam e Frodo tinham subido apenas alguns degraus, e Gandalf mal
começava a subir a escada, quando os tentaculos avidos serpentearam em direção
à margem estreita e tatearam a parede do rochedo e as portas. Um deles chegou meneando
até a entrada da passagem, reluzindo à luz das estrelas. Gandalf se voltou
e parou. Se estava pensando numa palavra para fechar a porta outra vez, de dentro, não
havia necessidade. Muitos braços sinuosos se agarraram às portas dos dois
lados, e com uma força terrível as empurraram. Com um eco ensurdecedor elas se fecharam,
e perdeu-se toda a luminosidade. Através da rocha sólida ouvia-se o ruído
de algo se quebrando, ou sendo rasgado.
Sam, pendurado ao braço de Frodo, tropeçou num degrau devido à escuridão negra. - Pobre
Bill - disse Sam numa voz sufocada. - Pobre
Bill, lobos e serpentes! Mas as serpentes foram demais para ele. Tive de escolher, Sr.
Frodo. Tinha de vir com o senhor.
Escutaram Gandalf voltar descendo os degraus, e bater nas portas com o cajado. Houve um
tremor na pedra e a escada oscilou, mas as portas não se abriram.
- Muito bem! - disse o mago. -A passagem atrás de nós está bloqueada agora, e só existe
uma saída - do outro lado das montanhas. Receio, pelos ecos, que haja um
monte de pedras contra o portão e que as árvores tenham sido arrancadas e atravessadas
diante dele. Sinto muito, pois eram
bonitas e estavam ali havia muito tempo.
- Senti que algo horrível estava próximo desde o primeiro mometo em que meu pé tocou a
água - disse Frodo. O que era aquela coisa, OU havia muitas delas?
- Não sei - respondeu Gandalf -, mas os braços estavam todos sendo guiados por um único
propósito. Alguma coisa se arrastou, ou foi trazida para fora das águas escuras
sob as montanhas. Existem seres mais velhos e repugnantes que os orcs nos lugares
profundos do mundo. - Não falou em voz alta o que estava pensando: que qualquer
que fosse a criatura habitante daquele lago, ela tinha agarrado Frodo antes de qualquer
outro.
Boromir murmurou em voz baixa, mas o eco da rocha amplificou o som para um sussurro alto
que todos puderam escutar: - Nos lugares profundos do mundo! E para ali
estamos indo, contra minha vontade. Quem agora vai nos guiar nessa escuridão mortal?
- Eu - disse Gandalf -, e Gimli deve caminhar ao meu lado. Sigam meu cajado!
Quando o mago avançou subindo os degraus largos, ergueu seu cajado, de cuja ponta emanou
uma irradiação fraca. A ampla escada era segura

e não estava danificada. Contaram duzentos degraus, largos e rasos; no topo encontraram
uma passagem em arco, sobre um chão plano conduzindo para dentro da escuridão.
-Vamos nos sentar para descansar e comer alguma coisa, aqui neste patamar, já que não
achamos uma sala de jantar - disse Frodo, que agora parava de tremer do susto
provocado pelo braço que o agarrara, e subitamente sentiu uma fome enorme.
A proposta foi bem recebida por todos; sentaram-se nos degraus mais altos, figuras
apagadas na escuridão. Depois de comerem, Gandalf deu a todos um terceiro gole
do miruvor de Valfenda.
- Receio que não dure por muito mais tempo - disse ele. - Mas acho que precisamos de um
pouco, depois do pavor que passamos na entrada. E, a não ser que tenhamos
muita sorte, vamos precisar de todo o resto antes de atingirmos o outro lado! Tenham
cuidado com a água também! Há muitos riachos e poços nas Minas, mas não devem
ser tocados. É possível que não tenhamos oportunidade de encher nossos frascos e garrafas
até descermos para o Vale do Riacho Escuro.
- Quanto tempo vai demorar para chegarmos lá?
- Não posso dizer - disse Gandalf. - Depende de muitas coisas. Mas indo em linha reta,
sem errar o caminho, pode levar três ou quatro marchas, eu acho. Não deve
haver menos de quarenta milhas entre o Portão Oeste e o Portão Leste, em linha reta, e a
estrada pode ter muitas curvas.
Logo depois de um breve descanso, começaram a caminhar outra vez. Todos estavam ansiosos
para terminar a viagem o mais rápido possível, e dispostos, cansados como
estavam, a continuar a marcha ainda por várias horas. Gandalf ia na frente como antes. Na
mão esquerda segurava o cajado reluzente, cuja luz mostrava apenas o chão
diante de seus pés. Na mão direita carregava a espada
Glamdring. Atrás vinha
Gimlli, com os olhos faiscando na luz fraca, enquanto virava a cabeça de um lado
para outro. Atrás do anão caminhava Frodo, que tinha retirado da bainha sua espada,
Ferroada. Nenhum brilho emanava das lâminas de Ferroada e
Glamdring, e isso
já era algum consolo, pois, sendo o trabalho de ferreiros élficos dos Dias Antigos, essas
espadas brilhariam com uma luminosidade fria, se algum
orc estivesse próximo.
Atrás de Frodo ia Sam, e depois deste Legolas, e os jovens hobbits, e Boromir. Na
escuridão atrás destes, austero e silencioso, caminhava Aragorn.
A passagem fez algumas curvas, e depois começou a descer. Continuou constantemente para
baixo por um tempo, antes de ficar plana de novo.
O ar ficou quente e abafado, mas não era desagradável, e algumas vezes eles sentiam no
rosto correntes de ar mais fresco, que vinham de aberturas semi-ocultas
#330
nas paredes. Havia muitas dessas aberturas. No raio pálido do cajado do mago, Frodo via
de relance escadas e arcos, além de outras passagens
e túneis, que se dirigiam para cima, ou desciam abruptamente, ou se
abriam numa escuridão vazia de ambos os lados. Qualquer um ficaria desnorteado. Gimli era
de
pouca ajuda para Gandalf, a não ser por sua vigorosa coragem. Pelo menos não se
incomodava, ao contrário dos outros, com a escuridão em si. Freqüentemente, o mago
o consultava em pontos onde a escolha de caminhos era duvidosa, mas era sempre Gandalf
quem dizia a última palavra. As Minas de Moria eram vastas e intrincadas,
mais do que podia conceber a imaginação de Gimli, filho de Glóin, embora fosse um anão da
raça das montanhas. Para Gandalf, as lembranças de uma viagem realizada
há muito tempo eram agora de pouca ajuda, mas mesmo na escuridão, e apesar de todas as
curvas da estrada, ele sabia aonde desejava ir, e não vacilou, enquanto havia
um caminho que conduzia na direção de seu objetivo.
Não tenham medo - disse Aragorn. Estavam fazendo uma pausa mais longa do que costumavam,
e Gandalf e Gimli conversavam em voz baixa; os outros estavam reunidos

mais atrás, esperando ansiosos. - Não tenham medo! Estive com ele em muitas viagens,
apesar de nunca ter participado de uma jornada tão escura; há histórias em Valfenda
que contam coisas que ele fez, maiores que quaisquer Outras que já vi. Ele não vai se
perder, se houver um caminho para se encontrar. Trouxe-nos aqui contra
nossos temores, mas nos conduzirá para fora, a qualquer preço que precis pagar. É mais
provável ele encontrar o caminho de casa numa noite cega do que os gatos de
Rainha Berúthiel.
Para a Comitiva, era bom ter um guia assim. Eles não tinham combustível, nem qualquer
jeito de acender tochas; na fuga desesperada pela passagem, muitas coisas tinham
sido abandonadas. Mas sem qualquer luz, logo teriam fracassado. Não só havia muitas
estradas para escolher, mas também em muitos pontos havia buracos e alçapões,
e poços escuros ao lado do seu caminho, nos quais seus pés ecoavam conforme iam passando.
Havia fissuras e rachaduras nas paredes e no chão, e de quando em quando
uma fenda se abria bem diante de seus pés. A mais larga delas tinha
Mais de dois metros de largura, e demorou muito até que Pippin conseguisse criar coragem
para saltar sobre aquele vazio aterrorizante. O barulho da água se agitando subia lá
debaixo, como se alguma roda de moinho estivesse virando nas profundezas.
- Corda! - murmurou Sam. - Sabia que ia me arrepender se não a trouxesse.
À medida que esses perigos ficavam mais freqüentes, a marcha tornava-se mais lenta. Já
lhes parecia que estavam andando sempre em frete,
#331
num caminho sem fim que conduzia às raizes da montanha. Estavam mais que cansados, e
mesmo assim não parecia haver consolo na idéia de pararem
em qualquer lugar.
O ânimo de Frodo se elevara um pouco depois da escapada, e depois de comer algo e tomar
um gole da bebida; mas agora uma forte inquietude, que chegava às raias do
medo, tomava conta dele outra vez. Embora em Valfenda tivesse sido curado do golpe de
faca, esse ferimento cruel não deixara de ter efeitos. Os sentidos de Frodo
estavam mais aguçados e sensíveis a coisas que não se podiam ver. Um sinal de mudança de
que logo teve consciência foi o fato de poder enxergar mais no escuro que
qualquer um de seus companheiros, talvez com exceção de Gandalf. E, de qualquer forma,
ele era o Portador do Anel: estava pendurado na corrente que lhe pendia do
pescoço, e às vezes parecia um fardo pesado. Frodo tinha certeza do perigo que o esperava
à frente, e do perigo que o seguia, mas não dizia nada. Segurou mais firme
no punho de sua espada e foi em frente, obstinado.
A Comitiva atrás dele raramente falava, e mesmo assim em sussurros apressados. Não havia
ruído além do ruído de seus proprios pés; os passos pesados e monótonos
das botas de anão de Gimli; o pisar forte de Boromir, os passos leves de Legolas; as
batidas suaves, quase inaudíveis dos pés dos hobbits, e atrás os pés lentos
e firmes de Aragorn, com seu passo largo. Quando paravam por uns instantes, não se ouvia
nada, a não ser ocasionalmente o ruído distante de água correndo ou gotejando,
invisível. Mesmo assim, Frodo começou a ouvir, ou a imaginar que ouvia, alguma outra
coisa: semelhante a passos de pés macios e descalços.
O som nunca estava alto o suficiente, nem próximo o suficiente, para que Frodo tivesse
certeza do que escutava; mas, uma vez começado, nunca cessava, enquanto a Comitiva
estivesse em movimento.
Mas não era um eco, pois quando paravam o som dos passos continuava por uns instantes,
sozinho, e então silenciava.
Já era noite quando haviam entrado nas Minas. Tinham caminhado por várias horas, fazendo
apenas paradas rápidas, quando Gandalf deparou COM seu primeiro grande teste.
Diante dele estava um arco amplo e escuro, que se abria para três passagens: todas
conduziam mais ou menos para a mesma direção, o Leste, mas a passagem à esquerda
descia vertiginosamente, enquanto a da direita subia, e o caminho do meio parecia
continuar, suave e plano, mas muito estreito.

- Não me lembro de modo algum deste lugar! - disse Gandalf parando indeciso sob o arco.
Levantou o cajado na esperança de haver alguma marca ou inscrição que pudesse
ajudá-lo em sua escolha, mas nada disso apareceu. - Estou cansado demais para decidir disse ele, balançando a cabeça. - E suponho que todos vocês estejam tão cansados
quanto eu, ou ainda
#332
mais cansados. É melhor pararmos aqui pelo resto da noite. Sabem o que quero dizer! Aqui
está sempre escuro, mas lá fora a lua tardia já se dirige para o Oeste,
e a meia-noite já passou.
- Pobre Bill! - disse Sam. - Fico imaginando onde estará. Espero que aqueles lobos ainda
não o tenham capturado.
À esquerda do grande arco, encontraram uma porta de pedra: estava parcialmente fechada,
mas se abriu facilmente a um leve empurrão. Atrás dela parecia haver um quarto,
cortado na rocha.
- Calma! Calma! - gritou Gandalf, quando Merry e Pippin empurraram a porta para frente,
felizes por encontrar um lugar onde poderiam descansar com pelo menos um
pouco mais de sensação de abrigo do que na passagem aberta. - Calma! Vocês ainda não
sabem o que está aí dentro. Vou na frente.
Entrou com cuidado, e os outros fizeram uma fila atrás. - Aí está! disse ele apontando
com o cajado para um ponto no meio do chão. Diante deles, viram um buraco
grande e redondo, como a boca de um poço. Correntes quebradas e enferrujadas estavam
caídas sobre a borda, e desciam pelo poço negro. Ao redor estavam fragmentos
de pedra.
- Um de vocês poderia ter caído, e agora ainda estaria imaginando quando iria chegar ao
fundo - disse Aragorn para Merry. - Deixem que o guia vá na frente, enquanto
vocês ainda têm um.
- Este lugar parece ter sido uma guarita, feita para que as três passagens fossem
vigiadas - disse Gimli. - É fácil perceber que aquele buraco foi um poço para
o uso dos guardas, coberto com uma tampa de pedra. Mas a tampa está quebrada, e todos nós
devemos nos precaver no escuro.
Pippin se sentiu curiosamente atraído pelo poço. Enquanto os outros
estavam desenrolando cobertores e preparando leitos próximos às paredes da sala, o mais
longe
possível do buraco no chão, ele se arrastou até a borda e espiou lá dentro.
Um ar frio pareceu bater em seu rosto, subindo de profundezas invisíveis. Movido por
um súbito impulso, ele tateou o chão proCurando uma pedra solta, deixando-a cair no poço.
Sentiu o coração bater moitas vezes antes que se ouvisse qualquer som.
Então, lá embaixo, como se a pedra tivesse caído em águas profundas, nalgum lugar
cavernoso,
ouviu-se um ruído bem distante, mas amplificado e repetido no poço oco.
- Que foi isso? - perguntou Gandalf. Ficou aliviado quando
Pippin confessou o
que tinha feito;
mas ficou furioso, e Pippin pôde ver seus olhos faiscando.
- Seu Túk tolo! - rosnou ele. - Esta é uma viagem séria, não um piquenique de hobbits.
Atire-se da próxima vez, e então não vai mais atrapalhar. Agora, fique quieto!
Nada mais se ouviu por vários minutos; mas depois, das profundezas, vieram batidas
fracas:
tum-tá, tá-tum. Pararam, e quando os ecos silenciaram,
#333
as batidas se repetiram: tá-tum, tum-tá, tá-tá, tum, Soavam como sinais de algum tipo, e
provocaram inquietação em todos; mas depois de um tempo as batidas
silenciaram e não se ouviram de novo.
- Aquilo foi o som de um martelo, ou eu nunca ouvi um martelo disse Gimli.
- Sim - disse Gandalf -, e eu não gosto disso. Pode não ter nada a ver

com a pedra tola de Peregrin, mas provavelmente alguma coisa foi incomodada, e seria
melhor
tê-la deixado quieta. Por favor, não façam nada assim outra vez! Vamos tentar descansar
um pouco sem mais problemas. Você, pippin, pode fazer o primeiro turno de
guarda, como recompensa - rosnou ele, enquanto se enrolava num cobertor.
Pippin se sentou arrasado perto da porta, naquela escuridão total; mas de quando em
quando se voltava, com medo de que alguma coisa desconhecida se arrastasse para
fora do poço. Queria cobrir o buraco, mesmo que fosse só com um cobertor, mas não ousou
mexer ou se aproximar dele, apesar de Gandalf parecer adormecido.
Na verdade, Gandalf não estava dormindo, embora estivesse deitado imóvel e em silêncio.
Estava mergulhado em pensamentos, tentando relembrar cada detalhe de
sua primeira viagem nas Minas, e considerando ansiosamente o proximo caminho que deveriam
tomar; uma escolha errada naquele momento poderia ser desastrosa. Depois
de uma hora, levantou-se e se aproximou de Pippin.
Vá para um canto e durma um pouco, meu rapaz - disse ele num tom gentil.
Suponho que
você precisa dormir. Não consigo pegar no sono, então é melhor eu fazer a
guarda.
- Sei qual é o problema comigo - murmurou ele, enquanto se sentava perto da porta. Preciso fumar! Não fumo desde aquela manhã antes da tempestade de neve.
A última coisa que Pippin viu, antes de adormecer, foi a figura escura do velho mago
agachado no chão, protegendo com as mãos nodosas uma chama entre os joelhos.
A centelha mostrou por UM momento seu nariz pontudo, e a baforada de fumaça.
Foi Gandalf quem acordou todos os outros. Tinha ficado sentado, fazendo a guarda sozinho
por seis horas, deixando que os outros descansassem.
- E durante a guarda tomei minha decisão - disse ele. - Não tenho vontade de ir pelo
caminho do meio, e não gostei do cheiro do caminho à esquerda: há um ar pestilento
lá embaixo, ou então não sou um guia. Escolhi a passagem da direita. Está na hora de
começarmos a subir outra vez.
Por oito horas escuras, sem contar duas breves paradas, marcharam adiante; não
encontraram perigos, nem escutaram nada, e não viram nada a não ser o brilho apagado
da luz do mago, brilhando como fogo-fátuo na
#334
frente deles. O corredor que tinham escolhido ia cada vez mais para cima. Pelo que podiam
julgar, subia em grandes curvas, e conforme
,iam subindo, a passagem
ficava mais alta e larga. Agora não havia outras aberturas para Outras galerias ou túneis
dos dois lados, e o chão era plano e seguro, sern POÇOS Ou rachaduras.
Evidentemente, tinham tomado o que certa vez tinha sido uma estrada importante, e
avançavam mais rápido agora que na
primeira marcha.
Assim foram adiante cerca de quinze milhas, medidas numa linha direta na direção Leste,
embora na realidade devam ter caminhado Vinte milhas ou mais. Conforme a
estrada subia, o ânimo de Frodo aumentou um pouco, mas ele ainda se sentia oprimido, e
ainda ouvia algumas vezes, ou pensava ouvir, bem atrás da Comitiva e distante
do som dos passos do grupo, passadas que os seguiam, e que não eram um eco.
Tinham andado o máximo que os hobbits podiam agüentar sem descanso, e estavam todos
pensando num lugar onde pudessem dormir, quando de repente as paredes à direita
e à esquerda desapareceram. Pareciam ter passado através de algum arco, entrando num
espaço negro e vazio. Atrás deles vinha uma forte corrente de ar mais quente,
e na frente sentiam a escuridão fria sobre Seus rostos. Pararam e se juntaram, cheios de
ansiedade.
Gandalf parecia satisfeito. - Escolhi o caminho certo - disse ele. - Finalmente
estamos chegando às partes habitáveis, e acho que não estamos longe do lado Leste.
Mas estamos num ponto muito elevado, bem acima do Portão do Riacho Escuro, a não ser que
eu esteja enganado. Pelo ar que estou sentindo, diria que estamos num salão
amplo. Agora vou arriscar um pouco de luz de verdade.

Levantou o cajado, e por um breve instante houve um clarão, como um relâmpago. Sombras
grandes saltaram e fugiram, e por um segundo eles viram um teto amplo acima
de suas cabeças, apoiado em muitos pilares feitos de pedra. Adiante, e dos dois lados, se
espalhava um enorme salão vazio; as paredes negras, polidas e lisas como
vidro, brilhavam e faiscavam. Enxergaram outras três entradas, arcos negros e escuros: um
diretamente à frente, rumando para o Leste, e um de cada lado. Depois disso,
a luz se apagou.
- Isso é tudo que Vou arriscar por enquanto - disse Gandalf. - Costumava haver grandes
janelas na encosta da montanha, e aberturas conduzindo para a luz, nos pontos
mais altos das Minas. Acho que as atingimos agora, mas lá fora é noite outra vez, e não
podemos ter certeza até amanhã cedo. Se estou certo, amanhã poderemos realmente
ver o dia nascendo, espiando aqui dentro. Mas enquanto isso é melhor não avançarmos mais.
Vamos descansar, se pudermos. As coisas estão indo bem até agora, e a maior
#335
parte da estrada escura já passou. Mas ainda não atravessamos as Minas, e há
um bom caminho até os Portões que lá embaixo se abrem para o mundo.
os membros da Comitiva passaram a noite no grande salão cavernoso, encolhidos num canto
para escapar da corrente de vento: parecia haver
um fluxo constante de ar frio vindo através do arco Leste. Por toda a volta, pairava a
escuridão, vazia e imensa, e eles se sentiam oprimidos pelo abandono e pela
vastidão das paredes de pedra, e pelas escadarias e corredores que se ramificavam
interminavelmente. As fantasias mais alucinadas que os boatos mais obscuros jamais
tinham sugerido aos hobbits ficaram insignificantes perto do terror e da surpresa que
sentiram em Moria.
- Deve ter havido uma multidão de anões por aqui nalguma época disse Sam -; e cada um
deles mais ocupado que um texugo por mais de quinhentos anos Para construir
tudo isto, e quase tudo em rocha dura! Para que fizeram isto? Certamente eles não viviam
nesses buracos escuros?
- Não são buracos - disse Gimli. - Este é o grande reino e a cidade da Mina dos Anões. E
antigamente não era escuro, mas cheio de luz e esplendor, como ainda
lembram as canções.
Levantou-se e, parado no escuro, começou a cantar numa voz grave, enquanto os ecos se
espalhavam em direção ao teto.
O mundo jovem, verde o monte,
E limpa era da lua a fronte;
Sem peia pedra e rio então,
Vagava Durin na solidão.
A monte e vale nomes deu,
De fonte nova ele bebeu,No Lago-espelho,foi se mirar E viu um diadema esrelar,
Gemas em linha prateada, Sobre a fronte ensombreada.
O mundo belo, os montes altos,
Nos Dias antigos sem sobressaltos
Em Gondolin e Nargothrond,
Dos fórtes reis que agora vão No Mar do Oeste além do dia:
Belo o mundo que Durin via.
Rei era ele em trono entalhado,
Salão de pedra encolunado,
No teto ouro, prata no chão,
#336

E as fôrtes runas no portão.
A luz da lua, de estrela e sol

Presa em lâmpada de cristal,
Por noite ou nuvem não tolhida,
Brilhava bela toda a vida.
Lá martelava-se a bigorna,
Lá se esculpia a letra que orna;
Lá se forjavam punho e espada,
Abria-se a mina, erguia-se a casa.
Perla, berilo e opala bela,
Metal plasmado feito tela,
Broquel, couraça, punhal, machado,
Lança em monte, tudo guardado.
O povo então não se cansava;
Toda a montanha retumbava
Ao som de harpas e canções
E trombetas junto aos portões.
O nwndo é cinza, velho o monte,
Da forja o fogo em cinza insonte;
Sem som de harpa ou martelada:
No lar de Durin, sombra e nada.
Sobre a tumba raio nenhum
Em Moria, em Khazad-dúm.
Mas inda há estrela que reluz
No Lago-espelho, sem vento e luz.
A sua coroa no lago fundo
E Durin dorme sono profundo.
Gostei! - disse Sam. - Gostaria de aprendê-la. Em Moria, em Khazaddúm! Mas parece que com
essa canção a escuridão fica mais pesada, pensando em todas aquelas luzes.
Existem ainda montes de jóias e ouro espalhados por aqui?
Gimli ficou em silêncio. Tendo cantado sua canção, não restava mais nada a dizer?
- Montes de jóias? - disse Gandalf - Não. Os orcs sempre saqueavam Moria; não existe mais
nada nos salões superiores. E desde que os anões fugiram, ninguém mais
ousa procurar as passagens e as tesourarias nos lugares mais fundos: agora estão cobertas
pela água - ou por uma sombra de medo.
- Então por que os anões querem voltar? - perguntou Sam.
#337

- Por causa do mithril - disse Gandalf. - A riqueza de Moria não estava no ouro ou nas
pedras preciosas: estes eram brinquedos para os anões;
nem no ferro, seu servo.
Essas coisas se encontram aqui, sem dúvida, especialmente o ferro; mas não precisavam
escavar para encontrá-las: todas as coisas que desejavam podiam ser obtidas
através do comércio. Pois aqui é o único lugar do mundo onde existia a prata de Moria, ou
a prata verdadeira,
como alguns a chamaram: mithril é o nome élfico. Os
anões têm um nome que não revelam. O valor desse metal era dez vezes maior que o do ouro,
e agora é incalculável: pois resta muito pouco
mithril acima do solo,
e nem mesmo os orcs ousam escavar aqui à procura dele. Os veios vão em direção ao Norte e
a
Caradhras, e descem para a escuridão. Os anões não dizem nada, mas
do mesmo modo que o mithril foi a base de sua riqueza, também foi a sua destruição:
escavaram com muita ganância, e muito fundo, e descobriram aquilo de que fugiam,

a Ruína de Durin. Do metal que trouxeram à luz, os orc-s levaram quase tudo, entregando-o
em tributo a Sauron, que o cobiça.
- Mithril! Todos os povos o desejavam. Podia ser moldado como o cobre, e polido como o
vidro; os anões podiam transformá-lo num
metal leve, e no entanto mais resistente que aço temperado. Sua beleza era semelhante
à da prata comum, mas a beleza do mithril não se opacificava ou perdia o brilho. Os elfos
o adoravam, e entre muitos
outros usos fizeram com ele o ithildin, a lua-estrela, que vocês viram sobre as portas.
Bilbo tinha um colete de anéis de
mithril que Thorin deu a ele. Fico imaginando
o que aconteceu com esse colete. Suponho que ainda esteja acumulando poeira na Casa
mathom de Grã Cava.
- O quê" - gritou Gimli, despertando do silêncio em que se encontrava, - Um colete de
prata de Moria? Foi um presente de rei!
Frodo não disse nada, mas colocou a mão embaixo da túnica e tocou os anéis de seu colete
de malha. Sentiu uma vertigem ao pensar que carregava o valor de todo o
Condado embaixo do próprio casaco. Será que Bilbo sabia" Não tinha dúvidas de que Bilbo
sabia muito bem. Era realmente um presente de rei. Mas nesse momento seus
pensamentos foram levados das Minas escuras para Valfenda, para Bilbo, e para Bolsão na
época em que Bilbo ainda estava lá, Desejou com toda a força de seu coração
estar de volta ao lar, e naqueles dias, cortando a grama, ou lidando com as flores, e
nunca ter ouvido sobre Moria, ou
mithril - ou o Anel.
Fez-se um silêncio profundo. Um a um, os outros adormeceram. Frodo fazia a guarda. Como
um ar que vinha através de portas invisíveis, de lugares profundos, o medo
o dominou. Sentia as mãos frias e a cabeça pesada. Tinha Os ouvidos atentos. Toda sua
mente esteve concentrada em escutar e nada mais, por duas horas arrastadas;
mas não escutou nenhum ruído, nem mesmo
o o eco imaginado de passos.
#338

Seu turno na guarda estava quase no fim quando, mais além do ponto onde supunha estar o
arco Oeste, Frodo imaginou ter visto dois pontos de luz clara, quase semelhantes
a olhos luminosos. Teve um sobressalto. Seus olhos tinham se fechado. "Acho que quase
adormeci durante a guarda", pensou ele. "Estava à beira de um sonho." Levantou-se
e esfregou os olhos, e permaneceu em pé, olhando para a escuridão, até que foi dispensado
por Legolas.
Quando se deitou, logo adormeceu, mas teve a impressão de que o sonho continuava: ouviu
sussurros, e viu os dois pontos de luz clara se aproximando, lentamente.
Acordou e viu que os outros estavam falando em voz baixa perto dele, e que uma luz fraca
lhe batia no rosto. Lá de cima, sobre o arco Leste, através de uma passagem
de ar próxima ao teto, vinha um raio longo e claro; atravessando o salão em direção do
arco Norte, a luz também avançava, fraca e distante.
Frodo se sentou. - Bom dia! - disse Gandalf. - Pois dia se faz outra vez, finalmente. Eu
estava certo, como vê. Estamos num ponto alto do lado Leste de Moria. Antes
do dia acabar, deveremos encontrar os Grandes Portões e ver as águas do Lago-espelho
sobre o Vale do Riacho Escuro.
- Ficarei feliz - disse Gimli. - Olhei Moria, que é realmente muito grande,
mas se tornou escura e temível, e não encontramos qualquer sinal de meu povo. Agora
duvido que Balin tenha chegado até aqui.
Depois de tomarem o desjejum, Gandalf decidiu continuar a marcha imediatamente.
Estamos cansados, mas poderemos descansar melhor quando sairmos daqui - disse
ele. -Acho que nenhum de nós deseja passar mais uma noite em Moria.
- De jeito nenhum! - disse Boromir. - Que caminho vamos tomar? Continuamos pelo arco
Leste?

- Talvez - disse Gandalf. - Mas ainda não sei exatamente onde estamos. - A não ser que
esteja redondamente enganado, suponho que estejamos acima e ao Norte dos Grandes
Portões, e pode não ser fácil encontrar a estrada certa que desce até eles.
Provavelmente, o arco Leste será o caminho que devemos tomar, mas antes de decidir temos
de dar uma examinada no local. Vamos em direção àquela luz na porta Norte. Se pudéssemos
encontrar uma janela, isso ajudaria bastante, mas receio que a luz só chegUe
aqui através das passagens de ar.
Seguindo-o, a Comitiva passou por baixo do arco Norte. Viram-se num corredor largo. À
medida que avançavam por ele, a luz ia ficando mais forte, e perceberam que
ela vinha através de uma entrada à direita. Era alta e quadrada, e a porta de pedra ainda
estava no lugar, semi-aberta. Além dela via-se um grande cômodo quadrado.
#339
Estava fracamente iluminado, mas aos olhos deles, depois de tanto tempo na escuridão,
parecia de uma luminosidade ofuscante; os olhos piscaram repetidas vezes no momento em
que entraram.
Os pes pisaram uma grande camada de poeira sobre o chão, e tropeçaram em coisas que
estavam na passagem, cujas formas eles não puderam
distinguir num primeiro momento.
O cômodo era iluminado por uma grande abertura na parede Leste, mais à frente.
A luz batia diretamente numa mesa no meio da sala: um único bloco retangular, de cerca
de sessenta centímetros de altura,
sobre o qual fora assentada uma grande laje de pedra branca.
- Parece um túmulo - murmurou Frodo, inclinando-se para olhar mais de perto, com uma
estranha sensação de mau presságio. Gandalf veio rapidamente para o lado dele.
Na laje havia runas, gravadas a fundo:
(RUNAS)
Estas são Runas de Daeron, como as que eram usadas antigamente em Moria - disse Gandalf Aqui está escrito, nas línguas dos homens e anões:
BALIN, FILHO DE FUNDIN,
SENHOR DE MORIA.
- Então ele está morto - disse Frodo. - Receava que fosse verdade. Gimli cobriu o rosto
com o capuz.

CAPíTULO V
A PONTE DE KHAZAD-DUM

A comitiva do Anel parou diante do túmulo de Balin, em silêncio. Frodo pensou em Bílbo,
em sua longa amizade com o anão, e na visita de Balin ao Condado há muito
tempo. Naquele salão empoeirado nas montanhas, essas coisas pareciam ter sido há mil
anos, e do outro lado do mundo.
Finalmente se mexeram e olharam para cima, começando a procurar alguma coisa que desse
pistas do destino de Balin, ou mostrasse o que acontecera ao seu povo. Havia
uma outra porta menor do outro lado do salão, embaixo de uma passagem de ar. Perto das
duas portas viam-se agora muitos ossos, entre os quais havia espadas quebradas

e martelos sem cabo, além de cimos e escudos partidos. Algumas das espadas eram tortas:
cimitarras de
orcs con, lâminas enegrecidas.
Havia várias reentrâncias cortadas na rocha das paredes, e nelas estavam grandes arcas de
madeira com braçadeiras de ferro. Todas tinham sido quebradas e saqueadas,
mas ao lado da tampa despedaçada de uma das arcas estavam os restos de um livro. Tinha
sido perfurado e rasgado, e parcialmente queimado, e estava tão manchado com
marcas negras e outras semelhantes a sangue envelhecido, que pouca coisa podia ser lida.
Gandalf o ergueu com cuidado, mas as folhas estalaram e se partiram quando
o mago o colocou sobre a laje. Estudou o livro por um tempo sem dizer nada. Parados ao
lado dele, Frodo e Gimlo puderam ver, enquanto Gandalf virava cuidadosamente
as folhas, que o livro tinha sido escrito por varias mãos diferentes, em runas, tanto de
Moria quanto de Valle, e alguns trechos com inscrições élficas,
Finalmente, Gandalf desviou os olhos do livro. - Parece ser um registro do destino do
povo de Balin - disse ele. - Acho que o livro começava com a chegada deles
ao Vale do Riacho Escuro, cerca de trinta anos atrás: as Páginas parecem ter números
referentes às datas de sua chegada. A primeira Página está marcada com um-três,
o que mostra que devem faltar pelo menos duas no início. Escutem isto!
- Expulsamos os orcs do grande portão e do posto de... eu acho; a próxima palavra está
borrada e queimada: provavelmente guarda, matamos Vários deles à luz - eu
acho - do sol no vale. Flói foi morto por umaflecha. Ele matou o grande. Depois há um
borrão seguido de Flói sob a relva perto do Lago-espelho. As próximas duas
linhas estão ilegíveis. Depois vem TomamOs o vigésimo primeiro salão da extremidade Norte
para morar.
Há...

não consigo ler o quê. Uma passagem de ar é mencionada. Depois Balin fixou seu assento na
Câmara de Mazarbul.
- A Câmara dos Registros - disse Gimli. - Acho que é onde estamos agora.
- Bem, não consigo mais ler por um bom trecho - disse Gandalf com a exceção de ouro, e
Machado de Durin e alguma coisa elmo. Depois Balin e agora Senhor de Moria.
Com isso, o capítulo parece terminar. Depois de algumas estrelas, outra caligrafia
começa, e posso ler encontramos prata verdadeira, e depois as palavras bem forjada,
e depois uma outra coisa. Consegui! mithril, e as últimas duas linhas são
óin procurar os arsenais superiores da Terceira Profundidade, alguma coisa ir para o
Leste,
um borrão, para o portão de Azevim.
Gandalf parou e virou algumas páginas. - Há muitas páginas desse tipo, escritas com
pressa e muito danificadas - disse ele -, mas mal posso lê-las nesta luz. Agora
deve haver algumas páginas faltando, pois elas começam a ser numeradas com cinco, o
quinto ano da colónia, eu suponho. Deixe-me ver! Não, estão muito danificadas
e manchadas; não consigo lê-las. Podemos conseguir mais à luz do sol. Esperem! Tem alguma
coisa aqui: letras grandes, usando uma letra élfica.
- Poderia ser a letra de Ori - disse Gimli, olhando por sobre o braço do mago. - Ele
sabia escrever bem e rápido, e freqüentemente usava as letras élficas.
- Receio que tinha más notícias para reportar com sua letra bonita disse Gandalf - A
primeira palavra legível é tristeza, mas o resto da linha foi perdido, a não
ser que termine em tem. Sim, deve ser ontem, seguido de dia dez de novembro Balin, Senhor
de Moria, pereceu no Vale do Riacho Escuro. Foi sozinho olhar o Lago-espelho.
Um orc atirou nele de trás de uma pedra. Matamos o orc, mas muitos outros... do Leste
subindo o Veio de Prata.
O resto da página está tão borrado que não consigo ler quase nada, mas acho que
está escrito bloqueamos nossos portões, e depois impedi-los de entrarpor muito tempo
se, e depois talvez horrível e sofrer. Pobre Balin!
Ao que parece, não desfrutou do título que conquistou por mais de cinco anos. Fico
imaginando o que aconteceu depois, mas não há tempo para decifrar as últimas páginas

agora. Aqui está a última de todas. - Ele parou e suspirou.
- É uma leitura triste - disse ele. - Receio que o fim deles tenha sido cruel. Escutem!
Não podemos sair. Não podemos sair Eles tomaram a Ponte e o segundo salão.
Frár e Lóni e Náli sucumbiram ali. Depois há mais quatro linhas ilegíveis, e eu só
consigo
entender,foi há cinco dias. As últimas linhas são o lago está na altura
da muralha no Portão Oeste. O Vigia na Água
#343
levou Oin. Não podemos sair, e depois tambores, tambores nas
profundezas. Pergunto-me o que isso significa. A última coisa escrita está numa
carreira de garranchos em caracteres élficos: eles estão chegando. Não há mais nada. Gandalf parou e ficou pensando em silêncio.
Um súbito medo e horror daquele quarto tomou conta da Comitiva. Não podemos sair murmurou
Gimli. - Foi bom para nós que o lago tivesse abaixado um pouco, e que
o Vigia estivesse dormindo na ponta Sul.
Gandalf levantou a cabeça e olhou em volta. - Parece que eles tentaram resistir pela
última vez junto às duas portas - disse ele. - Mas restavam poucos naquela.
Assim terminou a tentativa de reconquistar Moria! Foi um ato corajoso, mas tolo. A hora
ainda não chegou. Agora, receio que devamos dizer adeus a Balin, filho de
Fundin. Aqui ele deve permanecer, nos salões de seus antepassados. Vamos levar este
livro, o Livro de
Mazarbul, e examiná-lo com mais atenção depois. É melhor você
guardá-lo, Gimli, e levá-lo de volta a Dáin, se tiver uma oportunidade. Vai interessá-lo
mas também vai entristecê-lo muito. Vamos embora! A manhã está passando.
- Em que direção iremos? - perguntou Boromir.
- De volta ao salão - respondeu Gandalf. - Mas nossa visita a esta sala não foi em vão.
Agora sei onde estamos. Esta deve ser, como disse
Gimli, a Câmara de Mazarbul,
e o salão deve ser o vigésimo primeiro do lado Norte. Portanto devemos sair pelo arco
Leste do salão, e nos dirigir para a direita e para o Sul, e descer.
O Vigésimo Primeiro Salão deve ser no Sétimo Pavimento, que fica seis acima do pavimento
dos Portões. Venham agora! De volta para o salão!
Gandalf mal tinha dito essas palavras, quando chegou a eles um enorme barulho: um
estrondoso Bum que parecia vir das profundezas, fazendo tremer a rocha aos pés
deles. Correram em direção à porta assustados. Dum, dum, retumbou o barulho outra vez,
como se mãos gigantescas estivessem transformando as próprias cavernas de
Moria num enorme tambor. Então veio uma rajada reverberando: uma grande corneta soou no
salão, e em resposta ouviram-se cornetas e gritos dissonantes vindos de algum
ponto distante. Ouviu-se o tropel apressado de muitos pés.
- Eles estão vindo! - gritou Legolas.
- Não podemos sair - disse Gimli.
- Presos! - disse Gandalf. - Por que demorei? Aqui estamos, presos, exatamente como eles
foram antes. Mas eu não estava aqui daquela vez. Vamos ver o que...
Dum, dum, vinha a batida dos tambores, estremecendo as paredes.
- Batam as portas e coloquem calços! - gritou Aragorn. - E segurem suas mochilas o máximo
que conseguirem: ainda podemos ter uma chance de escapar.
#344
- Não! - disse Gandalf. - Não devemos
ficar trancados aqui dentro. Mantenham a
porta Leste entreaberta! Iremos por ali, se houver uma possibilidade.
Um outro chamado estridente de corneta e guinchos agudos soou. Pés se aproximavam pelo
corredor. Ouviu-se um tinido e um tropel no momento em que a Comitiva desembainhava
as espadas. Glamdring emanou um brilho claro, e o gume de Ferroada faiscou. Boromir
empurrou a porta Oeste com os ombros.

- Espere um momento. Não feche ainda - disse Gandalf, pulando para o lado de Boromir, e
aprumando-se ao máximo.
- Quem vem aqui para perturbar o descanso de Balin, Senhor de Moria? - gritou ele com uma
voz cheia.
Houve uma torrente de gargalhadas roucas, semelhante a pedras caindo num poço; em meio ao
clamor, uma voz grave se ergueu em comando. Dum, blim, dum, faziam os
tambores nas profundezas.
Num movimento rápido, Gandalf avançou para a fresta da porta aberta, colocando à frente
seu cajado. Fez-se um clarão ofuscante, que iluminou a sala e o corredor.
Por um instante, o mago olhou para fora. Flechas zuniram e assobiaram pelo corredor, e
ele pulou para trás.
- Orcs, Muitos deles - disse ele. - E alguns são grandes e perigosos: Uruks negros de
Mordor. Por enquanto estão parados, mas tem alguma outra coisa lá. Acho que
é um grande troll das cavernas, ou mais de um. Não há esperança de escaparmos por ali.
- E não haverá esperança de nada, se eles vierem pela outra porta também - disse Boromir.
- Não se ouve nada deste lado ainda - disse Aragorn, que estava parado próximo à porta
Leste, escutando. - A passagem deste lado desce direto por uma escada: é
certeza que não conduz de volta ao salão. Mas não é bom fugir cegamente por aqui, com o
inimigo bem atrás. Não podemos bloquear a porta. Não há mais chave, a fechadura
está quebrada e a porta se abre para dentro. Temos de fazer alguma coisa para atrasar os
orcs primiro. Vamos fazer com que sintam medo da Câmara de
Mazarbul! - disse ele com austeridade, tocando o gume de sua espada, Andúril.
Ouviram-se passos pesados no corredor. Boromir se jogou contra a porta e a fechou com o
peso de seu corpo; então calçou-a com lâminas de espadas quebradas e lascas
de madeira. A Comitiva recuou para o outro lado da câmara. Mas ainda não tinham a
possibilidade de fugir. Um golpe fez tremer a porta que lentamente começou a se
abrir, rangendo e forçando os calços. Um braço e um ombro enormes, de pele escura coberta
de escamas esverdeadas, lançaram-se através da fresta que se alargava.
#345
Depois um pé grande, chato e sem dedos forçou a parte de baixo, abrindo-a. Havia um
silêncio mortal do lado de fora.
Boromir pulou para frente e golpeou o braço com toda a força, mas a espada rangeu,
resvalou e caiu de sua mão trêmula. A lâmina estava quebrada. De repente, e para
sua própria surpresa, Frodo sentiu uma ira feroz se acender em seu coração. - O Condado!
- gritou ele e,
avançando num salto para o lado de Boromir, abaixou-se e apunhalou com Ferroada o pé
asqueroso. Ouviu-se um
urro, e o pé recuou de supetão, quase arrancando Ferroada do braço de Frodo. Gotas negras
pingaram da lâmina, e caíram no chão fumegando. Boromir arremessou-se contra
a porta, fechando-a de novo.
- Um para o Condado! - gritou Aragorn. - A mordida do hobbit vai fundo! Você tem uma boa
lâmina, Frodo, filho de Drogo!
Ouviu-se uma pancada na porta, seguida de pancadas e mais pancadas. Aríetes e martelos
batiam contra ela. A porta se partiu e foi recuando e a fresta ficou subitamente
larga. Flechas entraram assobiando, mas atingiram a parede Norte, caindo no chão sem
ferir ninguém. Um clangor de corneta ecoou e ouviu-se um tropel de passos, e
orcs, um após o outro, pularam para dentro da câmara.
Quantos eram, a Comitiva não pôde contar. A luta foi violenta, mas os
orcs se assustaram perante a ferocidade da defesa. Legolas atingiu dois na garganta.
Gimli cortou as pernas de um outro que tinha subido no túmulo de Balin. Boromir e Aragorn
mataram vários. Quando trinta tinham caído, o restante deles fugiu tremendo,
deixando os defensores ilesos, com a exceçào de Sam, que tinha um corte na cabeça. Uma
esquiva rápida o salvara, e ele tinha derrubado seu
orc: um golpe vigoroso
com sua espada do Túmulo. Queimava em seus olhos castanhos um fogo que teria feito
Ted Ruivão recuar, se ele tivesse visto.

- Chegou a hora! - gritou Gandalf. - Vamos, antes que o troll retorne! Mas no momento em
que se retiravam, antes que Pippin e Merry tivessem alcançado a escada do
lado de fora, um enorme líder dos orcs, quase da altura de um humano, vestido da cabeça
aos pés numa malha metálica preta, pulou para dentro da câmara; atrás dele
seus seguidores se amontoavam na entrada. O rosto largo e chato era escuro, os olhos como
carvão, e a língua era
vermelha; brandia uma grande lança. Com um golpe
de seu enorme escudo de couro, afastou a espada de Boromir e o empurrou para trás,
derrubando-o no chão. Abaixando-se para se defender de um golpe de Aragorn, e
com a rapidez de uma serpente em seu bote, ele atacou a Comitiva e investiu com a lança
na direção de Frodo.
O golpe o atingiu no flanco direito, e Frodo foi jogado
contra a parede, ficando espetado pela lança. Sam, com um grito, golpeou a haste da
lança, que se quebrou. Mas justo no momento
#346
em que o orc soltou a lança e desembainhou sua cimitarra, Andúril atingiu seu elmo. Fezse um clarão como fogo, e o elmo se abriu em dois.
O orc caiu com a cabeça partida. Seus seguidores fugiram uivando, quando Boromir e
Aragorn pularam para cima deles.
Dum, dum, continuavam os tambores nas profundezas. A voz poderosa fez-se ouvir outra vez,
num estrondo.
- Agora! - gritou Gandalf. - Esta é a última chance. Corram!
Aragorn levantou Frodo, que estava caído perto da parede, e dirigiu-se para a escada,
empurrando Merry e Pippin na frente dele. Os outros o seguiram, mas Gimli
teve de ser arrastado por Legolas: apesar do perigo, ele insistia em ficar perto do
túmulo de Balin, com a cabeça abaixada. Boromir puxou a porta, cujos gonzos rangeram:
tinha grandes argolas de ferro dos dois lados, mas não se podia trancá-la.
Eu estou bem - disse Frodo. - Posso andar. Ponha-me no chão! Aragorn quase o deixou cair
de tão surpreso. - Pensei que estivesse
morto! - gritou ele.
- Ainda não! - disse Gandalf - Mas não há tempo para indagações. Saiam, vocês todos,
desçam a escada! Esperem-me alguns minutos lá embaixo, mas se eu não aparecer
logo, continuem! Apressem-se e escolham o caminho que conduz à direita e para baixo.
- Não podemos abandoná-lo aqui, segurando a porta sozinho! - disse Aragorn.
- Faça o que estou dizendo - disse Gandalf furioso. - As espadas não servem para mais
nada aqui. Vá!
A escada não era iluminada por nenhuma passagem de ar, e estava completamente escura.
Desceram aos tropeços um longo lance de degraus, e depois olharam para trás;
mas não conseguiam enxergar nada, a não ser pelo brilho apagado do cajado do mago na
parte de cima. Parecia que ele ainda estava parado, guardando a porta fechada.
Frodo respirou fundo e se apoiou em Sam, que passou os braços em volta dele. Ficaram ali,
olhando para a escada na escuridão. Frodo tinha a impressão de estar escutando
a voz do mago lá em cima, murmurando palavras que desciam pelo teto inclinado com um eco
sussurrante. Não podia entender o que estava sendo dito. As paredes pareciam
estar tremendo. De quando em quando, as batidas dos tambores pulsavam num estrondo: dum,
dum.
De repente, no topo da escada viu-se um clarão de luz branca. Depois ouviu-se um estrondo
e um baque surdo. As batidas dos tambores irromperam alucinadas: dum-biun,
du-dum, e depois pararam. Gandalf desceu correndo os degraus e caiu no chão, no meio da
Comitiva.
#347
- Muito bem, acabou! - disse o mago, esforçando-se para ficar de pé.
- Fiz tudo o que podia. Mas encontrei um inimigo à minha altura, e quase fui destruido.
Mas não fiquem aqui! Vão andando! Vão andando! Onde está você,
Gimli? Venha
na frente comigo! Fiquem logo atrás, vocês todos!

Foram tropeçando atrás dele, imaginando o que teria acontecido. Dum, dum, começaram de
novo os tambores: agora soavam abafados e distantes, mas vinham na direção
deles. Não havia outro som de perseguição, nem o pisar de pés, nem qualquer tipo de voz.
Gandalf não fez curvas, para a direita ou para a esquerda, pois o caminho
parecia conduzir na direção que ele desejava. De quando em quando, desciam por um lance
de
degraus, cimqüenta ou mais, atingindo um nível inferior. Naquela hora, esse era o maior
perigo, pois, na escuridão, não conseguiam ver uma descida, até
atingi-la e pisar no vazio. Gandalf tateava o chão com seu cajado como um cego.
Ao final de uma hora, tinham avançado uma milha, ou talvez um pouco mais, e tinham
descido muitos lances de degraus. Quase começaram a ter esperanças de escapar.
Ao pé da sétima escada, Gandalf parou.
- Está ficando quente! - disse ele, ofegante. - Devemos ter chegado no mínimo ao nível
dos Portões. Acho que logo devemos procurar uma passagem para o lado esquerdo,
que nos leve para o Leste. Espero que não esteja longe. Estou muito cansado. Preciso
descansar aqui um pouco,
mesmo que todos os orcs existentes no mundo estejam atrás de nós.
Gimli pegou-o pelo braço, ajudando-o a se sentar num degrau. - O que aconteceu lá em cima
junto à porta? - perguntou ele. - Encontrou aquele que bate os tambores?
- Não sei - respondeu Gandalf - Mas de repente me vi enfrentando algo que nunca tinha
visto. Não pude pensar em mais nada a não ser lançar um encantamento para fechar
a porta. Conheço muitos, mas para fazer esse tipo de coisa direito, é preciso tempo, e
mesmo assim a porta pode ser arrombada.
- Enquanto fiquei ali, pude ouvir vozes de orcs do outro lado: pensei que a qualquer
momento eles forçariam a porta e a abririam. Não pude ouvir o que diziam; pareciam
estar conversando na sua língua horrenda. Tudo o que entendi foi ghâ,h, que significa
"fogo". Nesse momento, alguma Coisa entrou na câmara - senti quando atravessava
a porta, e os próprios orcs ficaram amedrontados e quietos. A coisa pegou a argola de
ferro, e então sentiu meu encanto e minha presença.
- O que era não posso adivinhar, mas nunca senti desafio tão grande.
O contra-encanto foi terrível. Quase me destruiu. Por um instante, a porta fugiu ao meu
controle e começou a abrir! Tive de pronunciar uma palavra de Comando. Isso
foi pressão demasiada. A porta se partiu em pedaços. Alguma#348
coisa escura como uma nuvem estava
bloqueando toda a luz que vinha de dentro, e
eu fui jogado para trás, e caí escada abaixo. Todas as paredes desmoronaram,
e acho que o teto também.
- Receio que Balin esteja enterrado bem fundo, e talvez alguma outra coisa esteja
enterrada lá também. Não sei dizer. Mas pelo menos a passagem atrás de nós foi
completamente bloqueada. Ah! nunca me senti tão exausto, mas já está passando. E você,
Frodo? Não tive tempo de dizer isso, mas nunca fiquei tão feliz na vida como
no momento em que ouvi sua voz. Receava que fosse um hobbit corajoso, mas morto, que
Aragorn estava carregando.
- E eu? - disse Frodo. - Estou vivo, e inteiro, eu acho. Estou machucado e sentindo
dores, mas é suportável.
- Bem - disse Aragorn -, só posso dizer que os hobbits são feitos de uma matéria tão
resistente como nunca vi igual. Se eu soubesse, teria falado com mais delicadeza
na estalagem de Bri! Aquela lança poderia atravessar o corpo de um javali.
- Bem, fico feliz em dizer que não atravessou meu corpo - disse Frodo -, embora esteja me
sentindo como se tivesse ficado preso entre uma bigorna e um martelo. Não disse mais nada. Sentia dores quando respirava.
- Você saiu ao Bilbo - disse Gandalf. - Existe mais em você do que os olhos podem ver,
como eu disse a ele há muito tempo. - Frodo ficou imaginando se a observação
significava alguma outra coisa além do que foi dito.
Agora continuavam de novo. Logo Gimli falou. Seus olhos enxergavam bem na escuridão. - Eu
acho - disse ele - que há uma luz ali adiante. Mas não é a luz do dia.

É vermelha. Que poderia ser?
- Ghâsh! - murmurou Gandalf - Imagino se é isso que eles estavam dizendo: que os andares
inferiores estão em chamas? Mesmo assim, só nos resta ir em frente.
Logo não havia mais dúvidas quanto à luz, e todos podiam vê-la. Estava faiscando e
brilhava nas paredes da passagem diante deles. Agora podiam enxergar o caminho:
à frente, a estrada descia com grande inclinação, e a alguma distância estava um arco
baixo; através dele, vinha a luz brilhante.
O ar ficou muito quente.
Quando chegaram ao arco, Gandalf o atravessou, fazendo um sinal para que os outros
esperassem. Enquanto ficou ali parado além da abertura, eles viram seu rosto iluminado
por uma luz vermelha. Recuou rapidamente.
- Existe algum tipo de maldade nova aqui - disse ele - feita para nos receber, sem
dúvida. Mas sei onde estamos: atingimos a Primeira Profundeza, o nível imediatamente
abaixo dos Portões. Este é o Segundo Salão de Moria, e os Portões estão perto: ali, na
saída Leste, à esquerda, a menos de
#349
um quarto de milha. Do outro lado da Ponte, subindo uma escada larga, indo por uma
estrada ampla através do Primeiro Salão, e para fora! Mas venham olhar!
Espiaram para fora. Diante deles, estava um outro salão cavernoso. Era mais alto e bem
mais comprido que aquele no qual tinham dormido. Estavam perto do canto Leste:
no lado Oeste, o salão avançava mergulhando na escuridão. No centro se erguia uma fila
dupla de pilares. Estavam esculpidos como copas de árvores enormes, e os ramos
sustentavam o teto, terminando num trançado de ramificações menores. Os troncos eram
lisos e pretos, mas um brilho vermelho se espelhava nas suas laterais. Na direção
oposta, no chão, ao pé de dois grandes pilares, uma enorme fissura se abrira. Dela
emanava uma luz vermelha e violenta, e de vez em quando chamas lambiam a borda
e -se enrolavam nas bases das colunas. Mechas de fumaça preta pairavam no ar quente.
- Se tivéssemos vindo dos salões superiores pelo caminho principal, teríamos ficado
presos aqui - disse Gandalf. - Agora vamos esperar que o fogo fique entre nós
e o inimigo. Venham! Não há tempo a perder.
No momento em que o mago falava, escutaram de novo as batidas de tambores que os
perseguiam: Dum, dum, dum. Do outro lado, além das sombras no lado Oeste do salão,
vieram gritos e toques de cornetas. Dum, dum: os pilares pareciam vibrar e as chamas
tremiam.
- Agora, para a última corrida! - disse Gandalf - Se o sol estiver brilhando lá fora,
ainda poderemos escapar. Sigam-me!
Virou à esquerda e se apressou através do chão liso do salão. A distância era maior do
que parecera. Enquanto corriam, escutaram a batida e o eco de muitos pés vindo
atrás deles. Ouviu-se um grito agudo: tinham sido vistos. Seguiu-se um tinido e peças de
aço batendo. Uma flecha assobiou sobre a cabeça de Frodo.
Boromir riu. - Eles não esperavam por isso - disse ele. - O fogo cortou-lhes o caminho.
Estamos no lado errado!
- Olhem para a frente - gritou Gandalf - A Ponte está perto. É perigosa e estreita.
De repente, Frodo viu adiante um abismo escuro. No fim do salão, o chão desaparecia e
caía numa profundidade desconhecida. A porta externa só podia ser atingida
por uma estreita ponte de pedra, sem parapeito ou qualquer proteção, que cruzava o abismo
num arco de quinze metros. Era uma antiga defesa dos anões contra qualquer
inimigo que pudesse tomar o Primeiro Salão e as passagens externas. Só poderiam
atravessá-la em fila indiana. Gandalf parou na ponta, e os outros vieram atrás, todos
juntos.
- Vá na frente, Gimli - disse ele. - Depois Pippin e Merry. Sempre em frente, e subindo a
escada que fica depois da porta.
#350
Flechas caíam em meio ao grupo. Uma atingiu Frodo e, encontrando resistência, ricocheteou
no ar. Uma outra perfurou o chapéu de Gandalf e ficou ali, como uma pena

preta. Frodo olhou para trás. Além do fogo, viu um enxame de figuras negras: parecia
haver centenas de
orcs. Brandiam lanças e cimitarras que brilhavam vermelhas
como sangue à luz do fogo. Dum, dum, batiam os tambores, cujo som ia ficando cada vez
mais alto,
dum, dum.
Legolas se virou e preparou uma flecha, embora a distância fosse grande demais para seu
pequeno arco. Puxou a corda do arco, mas sua mão caiu, e a flecha escorregou
para o solo. Ele deu um grito de desespero e medo. Dois grandes trolls apareceram.
Traziam grandes lajes que jogaram no chão para servir de passarela por cima
do fogo. Mas não foram os trolls que encheram o elfo de medo. A multidão de
orcs se abriu, e se amontoou do lado, como se eles próprios estivessem com medo. Alguma
coisa vinha atrás. Não se podia ver o que fosse: era como uma grande sombra, no meio da
qual havia uma forma escura, talvez humanóide, mas maior; poder e terror
pareciam estar nela e ao seu redor.
A figura veio para a extremidade do fogo e a luz se apagou, como se uma nuvem tivesse
coberto tudo. Então, com um movimento rápido, pulou por sobre a fissura. As
chamas bramiram para saudá-la, e se ergueram à sua volta; uma nuvem negra rodopiou
subindo no ar. A cabeleira esvoaçante se incendiou, fulgurando. Na mão direita
carregava uma espada como uma língua de fogo cortante; na mão esquerda trazia um chicote
de muitas correias.
L- Ai! ai! - gemeu Legolas. - Um balrog! Um balrog vem vindo! Gimli olhou
com os olhos esbugalhados. - A Ruína de Durin - gritou
ele, deixando cair o machado e cobrindo o rosto.
- Um balrog! - murmurou Gandalf. - Agora eu entendo. - Perdeu o equi líbrio e se apoiou
no cajado. - Que má sorte! E eu já estou exausto!
A figura escura, envolvida em fogo, corria em direção a eles. Os orcs gritavam e
avançavam para a passarela de pedra. Então Boromir levantou sua corneta e a tocou.
Forte o desafio soou e retumbou, como o grito de muitas gargantas sob o teto cavernoso.
Por um momento os
orcs estremeceram e a figura de fogo parou. Então os ecos se extinguiram de repente como
uma chama apagada por um vendaval, e o inimigo avançou outra vez.
- Para a ponte! - gritou Gandalf, recobrando as forças. - Fujam! Este é
um inimigo além das forças de qualquer um de vocês. Preciso proteger o caminho estreito.
Fujam! - Aragom e Boromir não obedeceram ao comando, e ainda ficaram onde estavam, lado a
lado, atrás de Gandalf na extremidade oposta da ponte. Os outros pararam
bem na passagem na ponta do salão e se viraram, incapazes de deixar seu líder sozinho,
enfrentando o inimigo.
#351
O balrog alcançou a ponte. Gandalf parou no meio do arco, apoiando-se no cajado com a mão
esquerda, mas na outra mão brilhava Glamdring, fria e branca. O inimigo
parou outra vez, enfrentando-o, e a sombra à sua volta se espalhou como duas grandes
asas. Levantou o chicote, e as correias zuniram e estalaram. Saía fogo de suas
narinas. Mas Gandalf ficou firme.
- Você não pode passar - disse ele. Os orcs estavam quietos, e fez-se um silêncio mortal.
- Sou um servidor do Fogo Secreto, que controla a chama de Anor. Você
não pode passar. O fogo negro não vai lhe ajudar em nada, chama de Udún. Volte para a
Sombra! Não pode passar.
O balrog não fez sinal de resposta. O fogo nele pareceu se extinguir, mas a escuridão
aumentou. Avançou devagar para a ponte, e de repente saltou a uma enorme altura,
e suas asas se abriram de parede a parede, mas ainda se podia ver Gandalf, brilhando na
escuridão; parecia pequeno, e totalmente sozinho: uma figura cinzenta e curvada,
como uma árvore encolhida perante o início de uma tempestade.
Saindo da sombra, uma espada vermelha surgiu, em chamas. Glamdring emanou um brilho
branco em resposta.

Houve um estrondo e um golpe de fogo branco. O balrog caiu para trás e sua espada voou,
partindo-se em muitos pedaços que se derreteram.
O mago se desequilibrou na ponte, deu um passo para trás e mais uma vez ficou parado.
- Você não pode passar! - disse ele.
Num salto, o balrog avançou para cima da ponte. O chicote zunia e chiava.
- Ele não pode ficar sozinho! - gritou Aragorn de repente, correndo de volta ao longo da
ponte. - Elendil! - gritou ele. - Estou com você, Gandalf!.
- Gondor! - gritou Boromir, correndo atrás dele.
Nesse momento, Gandalf levantou o cajado e, gritando bem alto, golpeou a ponte.
O cajado se partiu e caiu de sua mão. Um lençol de chamas brancas se ergueu. A ponte
estalou. Bem aos pés do balrog se quebrou, e a pedra sobre a qual estava caiu dentro
do abismo, enquanto o restante permaneceu, oscilando, como uma língua de pedra estendida
no vazio.
Com um grito horrendo, o balrog caiu para frente, e sua sombra mergulhou na escuridão,
desaparecendo. Mas no momento em que caía, brandiu o chicote e as correias
bateram e se enrolaram em volta dos joelhos do mago, arrastando-o para a borda. Ele
perdeu o equilíbrio e caiu, agarrando-se em vão à pedra, e escorregou para dentro
do abismo. - Fujam, seus tolos!
- gritou ele, e desapareceu.
As chamas se apagaram, uma escuridão vazia dominou o ambiente. A Comitiva ficou presa ao
solo, horrorizada, olhando para o buraco. No momento
#352
em que Aragorn e Boromir voltavam correndo, o resto da ponte se partiu e caiu. Com um
grito, Aragorn os despertou.
- Venham! Vou conduzi-los agora! - chamou ele. - Devemos obedecer à última ordem dele.
Sigam-me!
Avançaram alucínadamente, subindo aos tropeços a escada atrás da porta. Aragorn na
frente, Boromír atrás de todos. No topo ficava uma passagem ampla e que produzia
ecos. Por ela fugiram. Frodo escutou Sam chorando ao seu lado, e então percebeu que
ele próprio estava chorando enquanto corria. Dum, dum, dum, os tambores batiam
atrás, lamentosos agora, e lentos; dum!
Continuaram correndo. A luz aumentava diante deles; grandes fendas se abriam no teto,
Correram mais rápido. Passaram para dentro de um salão, claro com a luz do
dia, que entrava pelas altas janelas no lado Leste. Atravessaram-no correndo. Passaram
pelas portas enormes e quebradas, e de repente se abriram diante deles os
Grandes Portões, um arco de luz fulgurante.
Havia uma guarda de orcs agachada nas sombras atrás dos grandes postos de vigia, que se
erguiam dos dois lados, mas os portões estavam arrebentados e destroçados.
Aragorn derrubou ao chão o capitão deles, que estava em seu caminho, e o resto fugiu
de medo de sua ira. A Comitiva passou pelos
orcs correndo, e não deu atenção a eles. Correram para fora dos Portões e desceram os
grandes degraus, amplos e desgastados pelo tempo, o limiar de Moria.
Assim, finalmente, depois de perdidas todas as esperanças, viram o céu aberto e sentiram
o vento batendo em seus rostos.
Não pararam até alcançarem uma boa distância das muralhas. O Vale do Riacho Escuro se
estendia ao redor. A sombra das Montanhas Sombrias se projetava sobre ele,
mas ao Leste havia uma luz dourada sobre a terra. Não passava uma hora do meio-dia.
O sol brilhava; as nuvens estavam altas e brancas.
Olharam para trás. A boca do arco dos Portões bocejava sobre a sombra da montanha. As
batidas dos
tambores retumbavam, fracas e distantes sob a terra: dum. Uma fumaça
fina e preta subia no céu. Não se via mais nada; o vale ao redor estava vazio. Dum.
Finalmente, a tristeza tomou conta deles, que choraram por muito tempo: alguns
em pé e quietos, alguns atirados ao chão. Dum, dum, as batidas dos tambores foram ficando
mais fracas, até que não se ouviu mais nada.

CAPíTULO VI
LOTHLÓRIEN

- Acho que não podemos ficar aqui por muito tempo - disse Aragorn. Olhou na direção das
montanhas e ergueu sua espada. - Adeus, Gandalp. gritou ele. - Eu não disse
a você: se passar pelas portas de Moria, tome cuidado? Infelizmente, o que eu disse tinha
fundamento. Que esperança temos agora, sem você?
Voltou-se para a Comitiva. - Vamos ter de nos arranjar sem esperanças - disse ele. - Pelo
menos, podemos ainda nos vingar. Vamos criar coragem e parar
de chorar! Venham! Temos à frente uma longa estrada, e muito a fazer.
Levantaram-se e olharam ao redor. Ao Norte, o vale subia e entrava numa abertura escura
entre dois grandes braços das montanhas, sobre os quais três picos brancos
brilhavam: Celebdil, Fanuidhol e Caradhras, as Montanhas de Moria. Do alto da abertura
descia uma torrente de água, como uma renda branca sobre uma escada interminável
de pequenas cascatas, e uma nevoa de espuma pairava no ar, envolvendo os pés das
montanhas.
- Aquela é a Escada do Riacho Escuro - disse Aragorn, apontando para as cascatas. Teríamos vindo pelo fundo do vale, pelo caminho que sobe ao lado da corrente,
se a sorte tivesse sido mais generosa.
- Ou se Caradhras tivesse sido menos cruel - disse Gimlii, - Ali está ele, sorrindo ao
sol! O anão ergueu o punho para o pico mais distante, e virou as costas.
Ao Leste, o braço das montanhas terminava abruptamente, e terras distantes podiam ser
avistadas mais além, amplas e vagas. Ao Sul, as Montanhas Sombrias recuavam
sempre mais, até onde a vista podia alcançar. A menos de uma milha, e um pouco abaixo,
podiam visualizar, do topo da encosta Oeste do vale onde estavam, um lago.
Era longo e oval, com o formato de uma grande ponta de lança incrustada na abertura ao
Norte, mas a extremidade Sul mergulhava nas sombras, sob o céu ensolarado.
Mesmo assim, as águas eram escuras: de um azul profundo, como o céu numa noite clara,
visto de um quarto iluminado por uma lamparína. A superficie era plácida e
sem ondulações. Em volta via-se um gramado macio, que descia até a margem contínua e
desnuda.
- Aquele é o Lago-espelho, o profundo Kheled-zâram! - disse Gimli com tristeza. - Lembrome do que ele disse: "Que você se alegre com a vista! Mas não poderemos
nos demorar lá". Agora vou viajar muito antes
#354
de poder me alegrar outra vez. Sou eu quem deve ir embora depressa, e ele quem deve
ficar.
A Comitiva agora descia a estrada que vinha dos Portões. Estava acidentada e danificada,
sumindo numa trilha sinuosa em meio a urzes e tojos que cresciam por entre
as pedras rachadas. Mas ainda se podia ver que havia muito tempo um grande caminho
pavimentado subira, descrevendo curvas, das terras baixas do Reino dos Anões.
Em alguns pontos se erguiam obras em pedra estragadas, margeando o caminho, e montículos
verdes cobertos por bétulas esbeltas, ou por pinheiros suspirando ao vento.
Uma curva ao Leste os conduziu para perto do gramado do Lago-espelho, e não muito
distante da margem da estrada erguia-se uma única coluna de pedra, quebrada na
extremidade.
- Aquela é a Pedra de Durin! - gritou Gimli. - Não posso passar por aqui sem me voltar um
momento para olhar para a maravilha do vale!
- Então seja rápido - disse Aragorn, voltando-se para olhar os Portões.

- O sol se põe cedo. Talvez os orcs não saiam antes do cair da noite, mas devemos estar
bem longe daqui antes do escurecer. A lua está entrando na fase minguante.
Esta noite será escura.
- Venha comigo, Frodo! - gritou o anão, saltando da estrada, - Não posso permitir que
você deixe de ver
Kheled-zâram. - Desceu correndo a ladeira verde. Frodo o
seguiu lentamente, atraído pelas águas azuis e plácidas, apesar do sofrimento e do
cansaço que sentia. Sam foi atrás.
Ao lado da pedra erguida, Gimli parou e olhou para cima. Estava com rachaduras e
desgastada pelo tempo, e as runas apagadas sobre a lateral estavam ilegíveis.
- Este pilar marca o ponto de onde Durin contemplou pela primeira vez o Lago-espelho disse o anão. - Vamos contemplá-lo também
uma vez, antes de partirmos!
Inclinaram-se sobre a água escura. Primeiro não conseguiram ver nada. Então, lentamente,
viram as formas das montanhas ao redor espelhadas num azul profundo, e os
picos eram como plumas de chamas brancas em cima delas; mais acima via-se um pedaço do
céu. Ali, como jóias no fundo da água, brilhavam estrelas cintilantes, embora
o céu que cobria suas cabeças estivesse ainda iluminado pelo sol. Das sombras dos
próprios corpos inclinados não se via nada.
- Oh, Kheled-zâram, belo e maravilhoso! - disse Gimli! - Ali permanece a Coroa de Durin
até que ele acorde. Adeus! - Fez uma reverência, depois se voltou e subiu
correndo o gramado verde, chegando até a estrada outra vez.
- O que você viu? - perguntou Pippin a Sam. Mas ele estava tão imerso em seus próprios
pensamentos que nada respondeu.
#355
A estrada agora tomava o rumo do Sul, e descia rapidamente, distanciando-se da região
entre os braços das montanhas. Um pouco abaixo do lago encontraram um grande
poço de água límpida como cristal, do qual um filete de água caía sobre uma saliência na
pedra e descia cintilante e borbulhante, por um canal íngreme de pedra.
- Esta é a nascente do Veio de Prata - disse Gimli. - Não beba dessa água! É fria como
gelo.
- Logo ele se torna um rio veloz, reunindo água de muitas outras nascentes que descem das
montanhas - disse Aragorn. - Nossa estrada o acompanha por muitas milhas.
Pois levarei vocês pela estrada que Gandalf escolheu, e primeiro espero chegar às
florestas onde o Veio de Prata deságua no Grande Rio - mais à frente. - Todos olharam
na direção em que Aragorn apontava, e puderam ver a corrente de água saltando e descendo
até o fundo do vale, e depois correndo para as terras mais baixas, até desaparecer
numa névoa dourada.
- Ali estão as Florestas de Lothlórien! - disse Legolas. - É a morada mais bela de todo o
meu povo. Não há árvores como as daquela terra. Pois no outono as folhas
não caem, mas se tornam douradas. Só na primavera, quando aparecem as novas folhas
verdes, é que elas caem, e então os ramos ficam carregados de flores amarelas,
e o chão da floresta é dourado, e dourado é o teto, os pilares são prateados, pois os
troncos das árvores são lisos e cinzentos. Assim ainda dizem nossas cançoes
na Floresta das Trevas.
Meu coração se sentiria alegre se eu estivesse sob o abrigo daquela floresta, e se fosse
primavera.
- Meu coração ficará alegre, mesmo no inverno - disse Aragorn. Mas a floresta fica a
muitas milhas daqui. Vamos nos
apressar!
Por algum tempo, Frodo e Sam conseguiram manter o passo com os companheiros. Aragorn os
conduzia com pressa, e depois de um tempo os dois ficaram para trás. Não
tinham comido nada desde manhã cedo. O corte de Sam queimava como fogo, e sua cabeça
estava leve. Apesar do sol que brilhava, o vento parecia frio depois da escuridão
quente de Moria. Ele tremia. Frodo sentia que cada passo era mais doloroso que o
anterior, e respirava com dificuldade.

Finalmente Legolas se voltou e, vendo que eles estavam bem atrás, falou com Aragorn. Os
outros pararam, e Aragorn correu na direção dos
hobbits, pedindo que Boromir o acompanhasse.
- Sinto muito, Frodo! - gritou ele, cheio de preocupação. - Tanta coisa aconteceu hoje, e
temos tanta pressa, que eu esqueci que você está machucado, e Sam também.
Deveriam ter dito alguma coisa. Não fizemos nada para aliviá-lo, como deveríamos, embora
todos os
orcs de Moria estivessem
#356
atrás de nós. Venham agora! Mais à frente há um lugar onde podemos descansar um pouco.
Ali farei o que puder para ajudá-lo. Venha, Boromir! Vamos carregá-los.
Logo em seguida, depararam com um outro curso de água que vinha do Oeste, e juntava suas
águas borbulhantes às do veloz Veio de Prata. Juntos eles saltavam sobre
uma cachoeira de pedra esverdeada e desciam espumando por um valezinho. Em torno deste se
erguiam abetos baixos e curvos, e as encostas eram inclinadas e cobertas
com escolopêndrios e moitas de mirtilos. No fundo se via um espaço plano, através do qual
a água corria barulhenta sobre seixos brilhantes. Ali descansaram. Eram
quase três horas da tarde, e eles só estavam a algumas milhas dos Portões.
O sol já se encaminhava para o Oeste.
Enquanto Gimli e os dois hobbits mais novos acendiam uma fogueira com a madeira de abetos
e de arbustos e pegavam água, Aragorn cuidou de Sam e de Frodo.
O ferimento de Sam não era fundo, mas tinha uma aparência feia, e o rosto de Aragorn
ficou sério ao examiná-lo. Depois de um momento, levantou os olhos aliviado.
- Teve sorte, Sam! - disse ele. - Muitos tiveram ferimentos piores como recompensa pelo
primeiro orc que mataram.
O corte não está envenenado, como freqüentemente acontece com os ferimentos provocados
pelas espadas dos orcs. Lave-o quando
Gimli tiver esquentado a água.
Abriu sua bolsa e retirou algumas folhas amareladas. - Estão secas e perderam um pouco de
seu poder de cura - disse ele -, mas ainda tenho aqui algumas folhas de
athelas que colhi no Topo do Vento. Amasse uma na água, e limpe o ferimento, e depois eu
lhe faço uma atadura. Agora é sua vez, Frodo!
- Eu estou bem! - disse Frodo, relutando em permitir que suas roupas fossem tocadas. - Eu
só precisava de um pouco de comida e descanso.
- Não! - disse Aragorn. - Precisamos dar uma olhada para ver o que o martelo e a bigorna
lhe causaram. Fico surpreso em ver que você ainda está vivo. - Delicadamente,
Aragorn retirou o velho casaco e -a túnica desgastada de Frodo, soltando uma exclamação
de surpresa. Depois riu.
O colete de prata cintilava diante de seus olhos como a luz sobre um mar ondulado.
Cuidadosamente, retirou-o e ergueu-o; as pedras que havia no colete brilhavam como
estrelas, e o som dos anéis sacudidos era como o ruído da chuva caindo sobre um lago.
- Vejam, meus amigos! - disse ele. - Aqui está uma bela pele de hobbit para embrulhar um
principezinho élfico. Se soubessem por aí que os hobbits têm peles desse
tipo, todos os caçadores da Terra-média estariam se dirigindo para o Condado.
- E todas as flechas e todos os caçadores do mundo seriam inúteis disse
Gimli, observando o colete, maravilhado. - É um colete de mithril.
#357
Mithril! Nunca vi ou ouvi falar de um tão belo, É desse colete que Gandalf estava
falando? Se for, ele o subestimou. Mas foi um presente bem dado!
- Sempre me perguntei o que você e Bilbo estavam fazendo, fechados naquele quartinho disse Merry. - Bendito seja o velho hobbit! Gosto dele mais que nunca. Espero
que tenhamos uma oportunidade de lhe falar sobre isso.
Havia uma contusão escura e enegrecida no flanco e ombro direitos de Frodo. Sob a malha
metálica, havia uma camisa de couro macio, mas num ponto os anéis tinham-na

perfurado e entrado na carne do hobbit. O flanco esquerdo também estava escoriado e
contundido, no local em que ele tinha sido prensado contra a parede. Enquanto
os outros preparavam a comida, Aragorn banhou o ferimento com a água na qual a folha de
athelas fora posta de infusão. A fragrância pungente se espalhou no valezinho,
e os que se agacharam sobre a água fervente se sentiram reanimados e fortificados. Logo
Frodo sentia que a dor ia cedendo, e que sua respiração ia ficando mais fácil:
apesar disso, a região atingida ficou sensível e inchada por vários dias. Aragorn
enfaixou-lhe o flanco com algumas tiras de tecido macio.
- A malha metálica é maravilhosamente leve - disse ele. - Vista-a de novo, se Puder
agüentar. Meu coração se alegra em saber que você tem um casaco desses. Não o
tire, nem mesmo para dormir, a não ser que a sorte o leve a algum lugar onde possa ficar
em segurança por um tempo, e isso tem poucas chances de acontecer enquanto
durar sua missão.
Depois da refeição, a Comitiva se aprontou para partir outra vez. Apagaram a fogueira e
todos os vestígios dela. Depois, saindo do vale, retomaram a estrada. Não
tinham ido muito longe quando o sol afundou atrás dos picos no Oeste, e grandes sombras
avançaram por sobre as encostas das montanhas.
O crepúsculo velou-lhes os pés, e uma névoa começou a subir pelas cavidades delas.
Adiante, no Leste, a luz da noite caía fraca sobre as terras apagadas da planície e da
floresta ao longe.
Sam e Frodo, agora aliviados e bastante reconfortados, conseguiam seguir num bom passo, e
apenas com uma breve parada Aragorn conduziu a Comitiva por mais quase
três horas.
Estava escuro. A noite profunda havia caído. Havia muitas estrelas claras, mas a lua
minguante não apareceria até bem mais tarde. Gimli e Frodo iam atrás, andando
suavemente e sem conversar, tentando escutar qualquer som que viesse da estrada atrás
deles. Finalmente Gimli quebrou o silêncio.
- Nenhum som a não ser o do vento - disse ele. - Não há orcs por perto, ou minhas orelhas
são de pau. É de esperar que os orcs fiquem satisfeitos em nos expulsar
de Moria. E talvez esse fosse o propósito deles, e não tivessem mais nada a ver conosco com o Anel. Apesar disso, os orcs
#358
sempre perseguem seus inimigos por muitas léguas, chegando até a planície, quando têm um
capitão morto para vingar.
Frodo não respondeu. Olhou para Ferroada, e a lâmina não estava brilhando. Mesmo assim,
ouvia alguma coisa, ou pensava estar ouvindo. Logo que as sombras caíram
ao redor deles e a estrada atrás ficou apagada, ele tinha escutado outra vez a batida
rápida de passos. Escutava-a até agora. Voltou-se rapidamente. Viu dois
pequenos pontos de luz atrás, ou por um momento julgou tê-los visto, mas eles
imediatamente desviaram-se e desapareceram.
- O que foi? - perguntou o anão.
- Não sei - respondeu Frodo. - Pensei ter escutado passos, e ter visto uma luz - como
olhos. Tive essa impressão várias vezes, desde que entramos em Moria.
Gimli parou e se abaixou até o chão. - Não ouço nada além da conversa noturna das plantas
e pedras - disse ele. - Venha! Vamos nos apressar! Os outrosjá desapareceram
de vista.
O vento noturno soprava frio, vindo do vale na direção deles. Adiante,
uma enorme sombra cinzenta assomava, e eles ouviram um interminável farfalhar de folhas,
como álamos na brisa.
- Lothlórien! - gritou Legolas. - Lothlórien! Chegamos ao limiar da Floresta Dourada.
Pena que estamos no inverno!
Sob a noite, as árvores se erguiam altas diante deles, arcadas sobre a estrada e a água
que corria veloz sob os galhos estendidos. À luz pálida das estrelas, os
troncos eram cinzentos, e as folhas que se agitavam tinham um traço de ouro fulvo.
- Lothlórien! - disse Aragorn. - Alegro-me em escutar de novo o vento nas árvores.
Estamos ainda a um pouco mais de cinco léguas dos Portões, mas não podemos ir

além. Esperemos que aqui a virtude dos elfos nos proteja do perigo que nos persegue.
- Se é que os elfos realmente ainda moram aqui neste mundo em que as sombras aumentam disse Gimli.
- Faz muito tempo que alguém de meu povo viajou até aqui, de volta à região de onde
saímos eras atrás - disse Legolas. - Mas ouvimos falar que Lórien ainda não está
abandonada, pois há um poder secreto aqui, que impede que o mal se aproxime do lugar. No
entanto, seu povo é raramente visto, e talvez more no fundo da floresta,
longe da fronteira Norte.
- Realmente, eles moram nas profundezas da floresta - disse Aragorn suspirando, como se
alguma lembrança se agitasse dentro dele. - Devemos nos arranjar por esta
noite. Vamos avançar um pouco mais, até que as árvores nos cubram totalmente, e depois
vamos sair do caminho e procurar um lugar para descansarmos.
#359
Deu um passo à frente, mas Boromir parou irresoluto e não o seguiu.
- Não há outro caminho? - perguntou ele.
- Que outro caminho mais belo você poderia desejar? - disse Aragorn.
- Uma simples estrada, mesmo que passasse através de uma cercaviva de espadas - disse
Boromir. - Por estranhos caminhos esta Comitiva foi guiada, e até agora para
encontrar má sorte. Contra minha vontade, passamos sob as sombras de Moria, para nossa
infelicidade. E agora você diz que devemos entrar na Floresta Dourada. Mas
desta terra perigosa ja ouvimos falar em Gondor, e diz-se que poucos que entram conseguem
sair dela, e desses poucos nenhum escapa ileso.
- Não diga ileso, diga inalterado, e então talvez dirá a verdade - disse Aragorn. - Mas a
tradição está se extinguindo em Gondor, Boromir, se na cidade daqueles
quejá foram sábios se fala mal de Lothlórien. Creia no que quiser, não há outro caminho
para nós - a não ser que voltássemos ao Portão de Moria, ou escalássemos
as montanhas onde não há caminhos, ou nadássemos sem proteção através do Grande Rio.
- Então vá na frente! - disse Boromir. - Mas é perigoso.
Realmente perigoso - disse Aragorn -, um lugar belo e perigoso, mas apenas o mal precisa
temê-lo, ou aqueles que trazem consigo alguma maldade. Sigam-me!
Tinham avançado pouco mais de uma milha na floresta quando encontraram um outro curso de
água que corria veloz das ladeiras arborizadas que de novo subiam para o
Oeste, na direção das montanhas. Escutaram a água caindo numa cascata escondida nas
sombras, à direita e um pouco mais adiante.
- Aquele é o Nimrodel! - disse Legolas. - Sobre esse riacho os elfos da Floresta fizeram
muitas canções antigamente, e ainda as cantamos no Norte, relembrando o
arco-íris sobre as suas cascatas, e as flores douradas que flutuavam sobre sua espuma.
Tudo agora está escuro, e a Ponte do Nimrodel está destruída. Vou molhar meus
pés, pois diz-se que a água é curativa para os que estão cansados. - Foi à frente e
desceu a margem íngreme, entrando com os pés na água.
- Sigam-me! - gritou ele. - O riacho não é fundo. Vamos atravessá-lo andando! Podemos
descansar na outra margem, e o som da água que cai poderá nos trazer sono e
esquecimento de nossas dores.
Um a um, os outros desceram também a margem, e por último foi Legolas. Por um momento,
Frodo parou perto da borda e deixou que a água corresse sobre seus pés cansados.
Era fria, mas seu toque era limpo, e conforme Frodo foi avançando e a água chegou à
altura dos joelhos, foi sentindo
#360
que suas pernas estavam sendo lavadas de toda a sujeira da viagem e de todo o cansaço.
Quando todos da Comitiva tinham atravessado, sentaram-se para descansar e comer um pouco;
Legolas contou-lhes as histórias de Lothlórien, que os elfos da Floresta
das Trevas ainda guardavam no coração, sobre a luz do sol e das estrelas, sobre os prados
próximos ao Grande Rio, antes de o mundo ficar cinzento.

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Finalmente se fez silêncio, e eles escutaram a música da cascata correndo docemente nas
sombras. Frodo quase imaginou que ouvia uma voz cantando, misturada ao som
da água.
- Estão ouvindo a voz de Nimrodel? - perguntou Legolas. - Vou cantar-lhes uma canção da
donzela Nimrodel, que tinha o mesmo nome do riacho perto do qual viveu
há muito tempo. É uma canção bonita em nossa língua da floresta, mas em
Westron fica assim, conforme alguns a cantam em Valfenda atualmente. - Numa voz suave,
quase
inaudível em meio ao farfalhar das folhas acima, ele começou.
Donzela élfica de outrora Brilhava à luz do sol:
No manto branco de ouro orla, Nos pés prata de escol.
Estrela presa sobre a testa,
Luz no cabelo dela; Qualsol dourado nafloresta De Lórien a bela.
Longas melenas, alva tez, Linda era e descuidada; Ao vento ia com rapidez
De folha defolhada.
Junto às quedas de Nimrodel, Na água clara e fria,
Sua voz de prata lá do céu Rebrilhando descia.
Não há ninguém que saiba agora Se em sombra ou luz está; Perdeu-se Nimrodel outrora,
Nos montes vagará.
#361
O barco élfico atracado,
Por monte protegido,
Por muitos diasficou ao lado Do mar enfurecido.
Um vento Norte a noite corta Com gritos e estertor,
E o barco élfco transporta Por maré de vapor.
Manhã sombria de terra em sombra, Montanha acinzentada,
Além de altas, arfantes ondas, Plumas de espuma e nada.
Amroth contempla o litoral
Já longe do escarcéu,
E amaldiçoa o barco o qual Lá deixou NÚnrodel.
Uu Elfo-rei outrora houvera,
Senhor de vale e planta;
Abria em ouro a primavera
Em Lórien que encanta.
Do leme ao mar sejoga num salto Qual,flecha desferida,
Nas águas.fúndas vem do alto, Falcão em sua descida.
Fluía o vento em seu cabelo,
A espuma o envolveu; Assimfioi vistoforte e belo, De cisne o nado seu.
Porém do Oeste não vieram Palavras ou sinais;
Os elfos novas não tiveram De Amroth nunca mais.
A voz de Legolas ficou trêmula e a cançao parou. - Não consigo mais cantar - disse ele. Esta é apenas uma parte, pois esqueci muita coisa. É
#362
uma canção longa e triste, porque narra como a tristeza chegou até Lothlórien, Lórien da
Flor, quando os anões acordaram o mal nas montanhas.
- Mas os anões não criaram o mal - disse Gimli.
- Eu não disse isso; mesmo assim, o mal veio - respondeu Legolas tristemente. - Então
muitos elfos do povo de Nimrodel deixaram suas moradias e partiram, e Nimrovel
se perdeu lá longe, no Sul, nas passagens das Montanhas Brancas, e não voltou para o
barco onde Amroth, seu amado, esperava por ela. Mas na primavera, quando o
vento bate nas folhas novas, o eco de sua voz ainda pode ser ouvido perto das cascatas
que têm seu nome. E quando o vento sopra do Sul, a voz de
Amroth vem do mar,
pois o Nimrodel deságua no Veio de Prata, que os elfos chamam de Celebrant, e o

Celebrante deságua no Anduin, o Grande, e o Anduin corre para a Baía de Belfalas, de
onde os elfos de Lórien partiram em suas embarcações. Mas Amroth e Nimrodel jamais
voltaram.
- Conta-se que Nintrodel tinha uma casa construída nos galhos de uma árvore perto das
cascatas, pois esse era o hábito dos elfos de Lórien, morar em árvores; talvez
ainda seja. Por isso foram chamados de Galadhrim, o Povo das Árvores. Nas profundezas de
sua floresta as árvores são muito grandes.
O povo da floresta não morava
no chão como os anões, nem construíam edificios resistentes de pedra antes de a Sombra
chegar.
- E mesmo nos dias de hoje, morar em árvores pode ser considerado mais seguro do que
sentar-se no chão - disse
Gimli. Olhou através do riacho para a estrada que
conduzia de volta ao Vale do Riacho Escuro, e depois olhou para o teto de galhos escuros
que lhe cobria a cabeça.
- Suas palavras trazem um bom conselho, Gimli - disse Aragorn. - Não podemos construir
uma casa, mas esta noite faremos como os Galadhrim: procuraremos refúgio nas
copas das árvores, se pudermos. Ficamos sentados aqui ao lado da estrada mais tempo do
que devíamos.
.
A Comitiva desviou do caminho, e mergulhou na sombra da floresta mais interna, na direção
Oeste, ao longo do riacho da montanha, para longe do Veio de Prata. Não
muito distante das cascatas do Nimrodel, encontraram um conjunto de árvores, algumas das
quais cobriam o riacho. Os grandes troncos cinzentos eram grossos, mas não
se podia adivinhar sua altura.
- Vou subir - disse Legolas. - Sinto-me em casa em meio às árvores, perto da raiz ou do
galho, embora essas árvores sejam de uma espécie que não conheço, a não
ser por seu nome numa canção. São chamadas de mallorn, e são aquelas que ostentam as
flores amarelas, mas nunca subi numa delas. Vou verificar agora seu formato
e o modo como crescem.
- Qualquer que seja - disse Pippin -, serão árvores realmente maravilhosas se puderem
oferecer algum tipo de descanso durante a noite, que não seja para pássaros.
Eu não consigo dormir num poleiro.
#363
- Então cave um buraco no chão - disse Legolas -, se isso for mais ao modo de seu povo.
Mas precisa cavar fundo e rápido, se quiser se esconder dos orcs. - Pulou
um pouco acima do solo e agarrou um galho que saía do tronco bem acima de sua cabeça. Mas
enquanto se demorava alguns segundos pendurado ali, uma voz falou de repente,
vindo das sombras
das árvores acima.
- Daro! - disse a voz num tom imperativo, e Legolas caiu no solo, surpreso e amedrontado.
Encolheu-se contra o tronco da árvore.
- Fiquem quietos! - sussurrou ele para os outros. - Não se
mexam e não falem nada!
Ouviu-se o som de risos suaves sobre suas cabeças, e então
uma outra voz audível
falou na língua dos elfos. Frodo conseguia entender pouca coisa do que se dizia,
pois a língua que o povo Silvestre ao Leste das montanhas usava era diferente da do povo
do Oeste. Legolas olhou para cima e respondeu na mesma língua.
- Quem são eles, e o que estão dizendo? - perguntou Merry.
- São elfos - disse Sam. - Não está escutando as vozes?
- Sim, são elfos - disse Legolas. - E estão dizendo que vocês respiram com tanto ruído
que poderiam acertá-los com uma flecha no escuro. Sam colocou rapidamente
a mão na boca. - Mas também estão dizendo que vocês não precisam ter medo. Eles já sabem
de nós há algum tempo. Escutaram minha voz do outro lado do Nirnrodel, e
souberam que sou um de seus parentes do Norte; por isso não impediram nossa passagem.
Depois, ouviram minha canção. Agora estão permitindo que eu suba com Frodo;
parece que tiveram alguma notícia dele e de nossa viagem. Pedem que os outros esperem
um pouco e vigiem ao pé da árvore, até que
eles tenham decidido o
que se deve fazer,

Das sombras, desceu uma escada: era feita de corda, de um cinza prateado e brilhava na
escuridão; embora parecesse frágil, mostrou-se forte o suficiente para suportar
o peso de muitos homens. Legolas subiu rápido e COM leveza; Frodo o seguiu devagar. Atrás
dele veio Sam, tentando respirar sem fazer ruído. Os galhos do mallorn
brotavam quase em ângulo reto com o tronco, e depois avançavam para cima; mas perto da
copa o galho principal se ramificava numa coroa de muitos ramos, e em meio
a estes eles viram que havia sido construída uma plataforma de madeira ou.flet, como
essas coisas eram chamadas naquele tempo: os elfos o chamavam de talan. Chegava-se
a ele através de um furo redondo no centro, pelo qual a escada descera.
Ver nota no vol. III, Apêndice F: Sobre os elfos.
#364
Quando Frodo finalmente atingiu o flet, encontrou Legolas sentado com três outros elfos.
Suas roupas eram de um cinza-escuro, e não se podiam ver em meio aos galhos
das árvores, a não ser que os elfos fizessem movimentos bruscos. Eles se levantaram, e um
deles descobriu uma pequena lamparina que emitia um raio de luz fraco e
prateado. Ergueu-a, olhando para o rosto de Frodo, e de Sam. Então cobriu a luz
novamente, e pronunciou palavras de boas-vindas em sua língua élfica. Frodo respondeu,
hesitando.
- Bem-vindos! - disse o Elfo outra vez, na Língua Comum, falando devagar. - Raramente
usamos uma língua que não seja a nossa; moramos agora nas profundezas da floresta,
e não nos relacionamos com outros povos voluntariamente. Mesmo nossos próprios parentes
do Norte estão separados de nós. Mas ainda existem alguns de nós que saem
daqui para coletar notícias, e para vigiar nossos inimigos, e eles falam a língua de
outras terras. Haldir é meu nome. Meus irmãos,
Rúmil e Orophin, falam pouca coisa em sua língua.
- Mas escutamos rumores sobre sua vinda, pois os mensageiros de Elrond passaram por
Lórien, em seu caminho de volta pela Escada do Riacho Escuro. Não ouvíamos falar
de... hobbits, ou pequenos, havia vários e vários anos, e não sabíamos que alguns deles
ainda moravam na Terra-média. Vocês não parecem maus! E já que vêm com um
elfo que é nosso parente, estamos dispostos a fazer amizade com vocês, como Elrond pediu;
embora não seja nosso costume levar estranhos pelas nossas terras. Mas
devem ficar aqui esta noite. Quantos são?
- Oito - disse Legolas. - Eu, quatro hobbits, dois homens, um dos quais é Aragorn, um
amigo-dos-elfos do povo do Ponente.
- O nome de Aragorn, filho de Arathorn, é conhecido em Lórien disse Haldir. - E ele tem a
simpatia da Senhora. Então está tudo bem. Mas você só falou de sete.
- O oitavo é um anão - disse Legolas.
- Um anão! - disse Haldir. - Isto não está bem. Não mantemos contato com os anões desde
os Dias Escuros. A entrada deles não é permitida em nossa terra. Não posso
deixar que ele passe.
- Mas este é da Montanha Solitária, do confiável povo de Dám, e amigo de Elrond - disse
Frodo. - Foi o próprio Elrond quem o escolheu para ser um de meus companheiros,
e ele tem se mostrado corajoso e fiel!
Os elfos conversaram entre si em voz baixa, e fizeram perguntas a Legolas na sua própria
língua. - Muito bem - disse Haldir finalmente. Vamos permitir, embora a
contragosto. Se Aragorn e Legolas estiverem dispostos a vigiá-lo e a responder por ele,
poderá passar. Mas deverá atravessar Lothlórien com os olhos vendados.
#365
- Mas agora não devemos alongar a discussão. Nosso povo não deve permanecer no chão.
Estivemos vigiando os rios, desde quando vimos uma grande tropa de orcs indo
para o Norte na direção de Moria, ao longo das bordas das montanhas, muitos dias atrás.
Há lobos uivando nas fronteiras da floresta. Se vocês realmente vieram de
Moria, o perigo não pode estar muito atrás. Amanhã cedo devem prosseguir.

- Os quatro hobbits devem subir aqui e ficar conosco - não temos medo deles! Há mais um
talan na próxima árvore. Ali os outros devem se refúgiar. Você, Legolas,
deve responder por eles. Chame-nos se algo estiver errado! E fique de olho naquele anão!
Legolas desceu imediatamente a escada para levar a mensagem de HaldIr, e logo depois
Merry e Pippin escalavam a árvore e atingiam o alto flet. Estavam sem fôlego
e pareciam terrivelmente amedrontados.
- Aqui está! - disse Merry ofegando. - Trouxemos seus cobertores, e também os nossos.
Passolargo escondeu todo o resto da bagagem num grande monte de folhas.
Não será necessária sua bagagem - disse Haldir. - Faz frio nas copas das árvores no
inverno, embora o vento esta noite esteja soprando do Sul. Mas temos para
oferecer-lhes,
comida e bebida que afastarão o frio da noite, e temos peles e capas a mais.
Os hobbits aceitaram essa segunda ceia (que foi muito melhor) com grande alegria. Depois
agasalharam-se bem, não só com as capas revestidas de pele dos elfos, mas
também com os próprios cobertores, e tentaram adormecer. Mas, cansados como estavam,
apenas Sam achou fácil dormir. Os hobbits não gostam de lugares altos, e não
dormem no andar de cima, mesmo quando têm qualquer tipo de escada. Oflet não servia de
modo algum como quarto, segundo o gosto deles. Não tinha paredes, nem sequer
um parapeito; apenas de um lado havia um fino biombo trançado, que podia ser removido e
fixado em diferentes pontos, de acordo com o vento.
Pippin continuou conversando por um tempo. - Espero que, se realmente conseguir dormir
nesse quarto que mais parece um sótão, eu não caia lá embaixo - disse ele.
- Se eu conseguir dormir - disse Sam -, vou continuar dormindo, caindo ou não lá embaixo.
E quanto menos falarem, mais fácil será eU cair no sono, se entendem o
que quero dizer.
Frodo ficou deitado por um tempo sem dormir, olhando para as estrelas que brilhavam
através do teto pálido de folhas que se agitavam. Sam já roncava do seu lado
muito antes que ele tivesse fechado os olhos. Frodo podia ver vagamente as formas
cinzentas de dois elfos sentados, sem se mexer,
#366
com os braços em volta dos joelhos, falando aos sussurros. O outro tinha descido para
fazer seu turno de guarda em um dos galhos mais baixos. Finalmente, ninado
pelo vento nos ramos acima, e pelo doce murmúrio das cascatas do Nirrirodel, Frodo
adormeceu com a canção de Legolas ecoando em sua cabeça.
Tarde da noite, acordou. Os outros hobbits estavam dormindo. Os elfos tinham-se ido. A
lua em forma de foice emanava uma luz fraca por entre as folhas. Não havia
vento. A uma certa distância, escutou uma gargalhada rude e pisadas de muitos pés no chão
lá embaixo. Ouviu um tinido metálico. Os ruídos foram sumindo devagar,
e pareciam se dirigir para o Sul, ou para dentro da floresta.
Uma cabeça apareceu de repente pela abertura noflet. Frodo se sentou alarmado e viu que
era um elfo de capuz cinza. Olhou na direção dos hobbits.
- O que foi"? - perguntou Frodo.
- Yrch! - disse o elfo num sussurro chiado, e jogou para dentro do flet a escada de
corda, enrolada.
- Orcs! - disse Frodo. - O que estão fazendo"? - Mas o elfo tinha sumido.
Não houve mais ruídos. Até mesmo as folhas estavam quietas, e as próprias cascatas
pareciam ter silenciado. Frodo se sentou, tremendo em seus cobertores. Sentia-se
grato pelo fato de não terem sido pegos no chão, mas também tinha a impressão de que as
árvores ofereciam pouca proteção, a não ser pela possibilidade de escondê-los.
Os orcs tinham um faro semelhante ao dos cães, mas também podiam subir nas árvores, Frodo
retirou Ferroada da bainha: a espada brilhou como uma chama azul; depois
o brilho foi sumindo devagar e ela ficou novamente opaca. Apesar disso, a sensação de
perigo imediato não abandonou Frodo; ao invés disso, ficou mais intensa. Ele
se levantou e foi se arrastando até a abertura para espiar lá embaixo. Estava quase certo
de que podia ouvir movimentos furtivos ao pé da árvore.

Não eram elfos, pois o povo da floresta era totalmente silencioso em seus movimentos.
Depois Frodo escutou um ruído baixo, como se alguém estivesse farejando, e
alguma coisa parecia estar raspando o tronco da árvore. Olhou para baixo no escuro,
prendendo a respiração.
Alguma coisa agora estava subindo lentamente e sua respiração vinha como um silvo baixo
entre dentes cerrados. Então, subindo, perto do galho, Frodo viu dois olhos
pálidos. Pararam e ficaram olhando para cima sem piscar. De repente voltaram-se noutra
direção e uma figura sombria escorregou pelo tronco da árvore e desapareceu.
Imediatamente depois disso, Haldir veio subindo depressa através dos galhos. - Havia
alguma coisa nesta árvore que eu nunca tinha visto antes #367
disse ele. - Não era um orc. Fugiu assim que toquei o tronco. Parecia ser precavido, e
ter alguma habilidade para subir em árvores; se não fosse isso, eu poderia
ter pensado que era um de seus hobbits.
- Não atirei, pois não arrisquei provocar qualquer grito: não podemos correr o
risco de uma batalha. Um grupo assustador de orcs passou por aqui. Atravessaram
o Nirmodel - amaldiçôo seus pés imundos poluindo aquelas águas limpas! - e foram
pela estrada velha ao longo do rio. Pareciam estar farejando algo, e ficaram um tempo
fuçando o chão perto do lugar onde você parou. Nós três não podíamos desafiar uma
centena, então fomos adiante e falamos disfarçando nossa voz, para atraí-los para
dentro da floresta.
- Orophin voltou agora correndo para nossas moradias a fim de avisar
nosso povo. Nenhum dos orcs sairá de Lórien. E haverá muitos elfos escondidos na
fronteira
Norte antes que mais uma noite caia. Mas vocês devem pegar a estrada para o Sul assim que
o dia chegue.
A luz do dia veio pálida do Leste. Conforme aumentava, ia sendo filtrada pelas folhas
amarelas do
mallorn, e os hobbits tiveram a impressão de que os primeiros raios
de sol de uma manhã fresca de verão começavam a brilhar. O céu, de um azul pálido,
espiava por entre os galhos que se
agitavam. Olhando por uma abertura no lado Sul do flet, Frodo viu todo o vale do Veio
de Prata se estendendo como um mar de ouro fulvo, ondulando suavemente com a brisa.
Era de manhãzinha e ainda estava frio quando a Comitiva partiu outra vez, guiada por
Haldir e seu irmão
Rúmil. - Adeus, doce Nimrodel! - gritou Legolas, Frodo se voltou e vislumbrou a espuma
branca através dos galhos cinzentos.
-Adeus! - disse ele. Parecia-lhe que nunca mais ouviria uma música tão doce de
água correndo, eternamente mesclando suas inumeráveis notas numa melodia interminável,
que sempre se alterava.
Voltaram para a trilha que ainda prosseguia ao longo do lado Oeste do Veio de Prata, e
por algumas milhas seguiram-na para o Sul. Havia pegadas de
orcs na terra.
Mas logo Haldir tomou outra direção e entrou na floresta, parando na margem do rio sob as
sombras.
- Há um membro de meu povo lá adiante, do outro lado da margem disse ele -, embora possa
passar despercebido por vocês. - Haldir emitiu um chamado semelhante ao
piar baixo de um pássaro, e de uma moita de arvores jovens saiu um elfo, vestido de
cinza, mas com o capuz jogado para trás, Seu cabelo reluzia como ouro ao sol
matinal. Haldir, com muita destreza, jogou por sobre a água um rolo de corda cinza, e o
elfo apanhou a ponta e a prendeu em volta de uma árvore perto da margem,
- O Celebrant já é uma correnteza forte aqui, como podem ver - disse Haldir. - E nesse
ponto corre rápido e já está fundo, e sua água é muito fria. Não entramos
nele aqui tão ao Norte, a não ser que seja necessário. Mas

nestes dias de vigilância, não construímos pontes. É assim que atravessamos! Sigam-me! Amarrou sua ponta da corda numa outra árvore, e então correu lépido por
ela, sobre o rio, de uma margem até a outra, como se estivesse numa estrada.
- Eu consigo andar nesse caminho - disse Legolas. - Mas os outros não têm essa
habilidade. Será que terão de nadar?
- Não! - disse Haldir. - Temos outras duas cordas. Vamos amarrá-las acima da outra, uma
na altura dos ombros, e outra na altura da cintura. Segurando nelas esses
forasteiros podem atravessar, com cuidado.
Quando essa frágil ponte havia sido feita, a Comitiva atravessou o rio, alguns com
cautela e devagar, outros com mais facilidade. Dos hobbits, Pippin acabou se mostrando
o melhor, pois ele pisava com confiança e andava na corda com rapidez, segurando com
apenas uma das mãos: mas ele mantinha os olhos na margem à sua frente e não
olhava para baixo. Sam foi sem levantar os pés, agarrado à corda e olhando para a água
clara e ondulada, como se fosse um abismo nas montanhas.
Respirou aliviado ao se ver a salvo do outro lado. - Vivendo e aprendendo!, como
costumava dizer meu velho pai. Apesar de ele se referir à jardinagem, e não a ficar
empoleirado como um pássaro, ou tentar andar como uma aranha. Nem mesmo meu tio Andy
jamais fez uma façanha como essa!
Quando finalmente toda a Comitiva estava reunida na outra margem do Veio de Prata, os
elfos desamarraram as cordas e enrolaram duas delas. Rúmil, que tinha ficado
do outro lado, retirou a última, pendurou-a no ombro e com um aceno de mão foi embora, de
volta ao Nimrodel, para ficar vigiando.
- Agora, amigos - disse Haldir -, vocês entraram no Naith de Lórien, ou o Gomo, como
vocês diriam, pois esta é a região que se estende no formato de uma ponta de
lança entre o Veio de Prata e o Grande Anduin. Não permitimos que estranhos espionem os
segredos do Naith. Na verdade, a poucos se permite que coloquem os pés aqui.
- Como combinamos, vou vendar os olhos do anão. Os outros podem andar livremente até que
cheguemos mais perto de nossas moradias, em Egladil, no Ângulo entre os
dois rios.
Gimli não gostou nem um pouco disso. - O acordo foi feito sem minha permissão - disse
ele. - Não vou andar com os olhos vendados, como um
mendigo ou um prisioneiro. Não sou nenhum espião. Meu povo nunca teve contato com
qualquer um dos servidores do Inimigo.
Do mesmo modo, nunca fizemos mal algum aos elfos. Eu não estou mais
propenso a traí-los do que Legolas, ou qualquer um de meus companheiros.
- Não duvido do que está dizendo - disse Haldir. - Mas esta é nossa lei. Não sou o dono
das leis, e não posso ignorá-las. Já fiz muito permitindo que vocês colocassem
os pés no Celebrante.
#369
Gimli se mostrava irredutível. Afastou os pés e fincou-os com firmeza no solo, colocando
a mão sobre o cabo do machado. - Vou caminhar livremente - disse ele -,
ou então volto e procuro minha própria terra, onde todos sabem que sou um anão de
palavra, mesmo que possa sucumbir em meio às regiões desertas.
- Você não pode voltar - disse Haldir com rispidez. - Agora que chegou até aqui, precisa
ser levado à presença do Senhor e da Senhora. Eles devem julgá-lo, retê-lo
aqui ou permitir que parta, conforme quiserem. Você não pode atravessar os rios outra
vez, pois lá atrás agora estão sentinelas secretas, pelas quais não poderá
passar. Seria morto antes mesmo que as visse.
Gimli puxou o machado do cinto. Haldir e seu companheiro aprontaram os arcos. - Malditos
anões com sua teimosia! - disse Legolas.
- Calma! - disse Aragorn. - Se ainda sou líder desta Comitiva, vocês devem fazer o que eu
determinar. É difícil para o anão ser discriminado desta maneira. Todos
nós vamos com os olhos vendados, até mesmo Legolas. Será melhor assim, apesar de nossa
viagem ficar monótona e demorada.

gimli riu de repente. - Vamos parecer um bando de bobos alegres! Haldir vai nos levar
numa coleira, como vários mendigos cegos seguindo um cachorro? Mas fico satisfeito
se apenas Legolas dividir essa cegueira comigo.
- Sou um elfo e parente do povo daqui - disse Legolas, ficando por sua vez furioso.
- Então vamos gritar: "Malditos elfos com sua teimosia!" - disse Aragorn. - Mas a
Comitiva deve partilhar tudo da mesma maneira. Venha, cubra nossos olhos, Haldir!
- Exigirei indenizações por cada queda ou dedo esfolado, se vocês não nos conduzirem
direito - disse gimli, enquanto lhe colocavam um pano em volta dos olhos.
- Não vai ter nada a exigir - disse Haldir. - Vou conduzi-los bem, e os caminhos são
planos e sem acidentes.
- É uma lástima a loucura destes dias! - disse Legolas. - Todos aqui são inimigos do
único Inimigo, e mesmo assim devo andar como um cego, enquanto o sol alegra
a floresta sob as folhas douradas!
- Pode ser loucura - disse Haldir. - Mas na verdade o poder do Senhor do Escuro nunca se
manifestou tão claramente como na hostilidade que divide todos aqueles que
ainda se opõem a ele. Apesar disso, encontramos tão pouca confiança e sinceridade no
mundo além de Lothlórien, talvez com a exceção de Valfenda, que não ousamos
arriscar a segurança de nossa terra confiando demais nos outros. Vivemos atualmente numa
ilha rodeada de Perigos, e nossas mãos tocam com mais freqüência os arcos
que as harpas.
#370
- Os rios nos defenderam por muito tempo, mas não são mais uma proteção segura; a Sombra
avança do Norte e nos rodeia. Alguns falam em partir, mas parece que já
é tarde para isso. As montanhas ao Oeste estão ficando perigosas; ao Leste as terras
estão perdidas, e cheias das criaturas de Sauron; comenta-se também que não
poderemos passar em segurança para o Sul através de Rohan, e que a foz do Grande Rio está
sendo vigiada pelo Inimigo. Mesmo que conseguíssemos chegar à beira do
mar, já não poderíamos encontrar qualquer abrigo ali. Comenta-se que ainda existem os
portos dos Altos-elfos, mas estes ficam no extremo Norte e no extremo Oeste,
além da terra dos Pequenos. Mas onde realmente ficam, embora possa ser do conhecimento do
Senhor e da Senhora, eu não sei.
- Você deveria ao menos adivinhar, já que nos viu - disse Merry. Existem portos de elfos
a oeste de minha terra, o Condado, onde vivem os hobbits.
- Os hobbits são um povo feliz por poder morar perto do mar! - disse Haldir. - Realmente
faz muito tempo que qualquer representante de meu povo colocou os olhos
nele, embora ainda o recordemos em canções. Conte-me sobre esses portos enquanto
caminhamos.
- Não posso contar nada - disse Merry. - Nunca os vi. Nunca saí de minha terra antes. E
se tivesse sabido como o mundo de fora era, não acho que teria tido a coragem
de deixá-la.
- Nem mesmo para ver a bela Lothlórien"? - perguntou Haldir. - Realmente, o mundo está
cheio de perigos, mas ainda há muita coisa bonita, e embora atualmente o
amor e a tristeza estejam misturados em todas as terras, talvez o primeiro ainda cresça
com mais força.
- Existem alguns entre nós que cantam que a Sombra vai recuar, e a paz voltará. Mesmo
assim, não acredito que o mundo à nossa volta possa ser o mesmo de antigamente,
ou mesmo que a luz do sol possa brilhar com a miesma intensidade. Receio que aos elfos
restará, na melhor das hipóteses, uma trégua durante a qual poderão passar
para o mar sem serem molestados e deixar a Terra-média para sempre. Sinto por Lothlórien,
que tanto amo! A vida seria pobre numa terra onde não nascesse algum
mallorn.
Mas se existem pés de mallorn do outro lado do Grande Mar, ninguém nunca comentou.
Conversando sobre essas coisas, a Comitiva seguiu em fila e lentamente pelas trilhas na
floresta, conduzida por Haldir, enquanto o outro elfo andava atrás. Sentiam
o chão sob seus pés macio e plano, e depois de um tempo passaram a caminhar com mais
liberdade, sem medo de cair ou de se machucar. Desprovido da visão, Frodo sentiu

seus outros sentidos se aguçarem. Podia sentir o cheiro das árvores e da grama pisada.
Ouvia vários tons diferentes no farfalhar das folhas acima, o rio murmurando
na distância
#371
à sua direita, e as vozes límpidas e frágeis dos pássaros no céu. Sentia o sol a lhe
bater no rosto e nas mãos quando passavam através de uma clareira.
Desde que pisara na outra margem do Veio de Prata, fora tomado por uma sensação estranha,
que ia se intensificando à medida que entrava no Naith: parecia-lhe que
tinha atravessado uma ponte do tempo e atingido um canto dos Dias Antigos, e estava agora
andando num mundo que não existia mais. Em Valfenda havia lembranças de
coisas antigas; em Lórien as coisas antigas ainda existiam no mundo real. A maldade havia
sido vista ou ouvida ali, conhecia-se a tristeza; os elfos temiam e desconfiavam
do mundo lá fora: os lobos uivavam nas fronteiras da floresta; mas sobre a terra de
Lórien não pairava sombra alguma.
Durante todo aquele dia, a Comitiva continuou marchando, até que sentiram a noite fresca
chegar, e ouviram o vento do crepúsculo sussurrando por entre as muitas
folhas. Então pararam e dormiram sem medo sobre o chão, pois os guias não lhes
permitiriam desvendar os olhos, e eles não podiam subir nas árvores. Na manhã seguinte
prosseguiram, e Frodo estava consciente de que caminhavam sob a luz do sol. De repente
escutou o som de muitas vozes ao redor.
Um grupo de elfos tinha se aproximado em silêncio: estavam correndo em direção às
fronteiras do Norte para protegê-la contra qualquer ataque de Moria, e traziam
notícias, das quais Haldir reportou algumas. Os orcs saqueadores tinham sido derrotados e
quase todos destruidos; o restante deles tinha fugido para o Oeste na direção
das montanhas, e estavam sendo perseguidos. Uma criatura estranha também tinha sido
vista, correndo com as costas arqueadas e com as mãos perto do chão, como um
animal e apesar disso sem ter a aparência de um animal. Tinha conseguido escapar, e não
atiraram nela por não saberem se era boa ou má, e a criatura tinha desaparecido
pelo Veio de Prata em direção ao Sul.
- Além disso - disse Haldir -, eles me trazem uma mensagem do Senhor e da Senhora dos
Galadhrim. Todos podem andar livremente, até mesmo o anão gimli. Parece que
a Senhora sabe quem e o que é cada membro da Comitiva. Talvez novas mensagens tenham
chegado de Valfenda.
Haldir retirou primeiro a venda dos olhos de Gimlii. - Minhas desculpas! - disse ele com
uma reverência. - Olhe-nos agora com olhos de
amigo! Olhe e se alegre,
pois é o primeiro anão que pode enxergar as árvores do Naith de Lórien, desde os dias de
Durin!
Quando por sua vez Frodo teve os olhos desvendados, ele olhou para cima e perdeu o
fôlego. Estavam parados num espaço aberto. À esquerda ficava um grande monte,
coberto por um gramado tão verde como a primavera dos Dias Antigos. Sobre ele, como uma
coroa dupla, cresciam dois círlos
#372
de árvores. As de fora tinham troncos brancos como a neve, não tinhain folhas e mesmo
assim eram belas na sua nudez elegante; as de dentro eram pés de mallorn
muito altos, ainda adornados por um dourado claro. Bem no meio dos galhos de uma árvore
alta que se erguia no centro de todas reluzia um flet branco. Ao pé das árvores,
e por toda a volta das colinas verdes, o gramado estava salpicado de pequenas flores
douradas, com formato de estrelas. Entre estas, pendendo de caules frágeis,
havia outras flores, brancas ou de um verde muito claro: brilhavam como uma névoa sobre a
rica tonalidade da grama. Acima de tudo o céu estava azul, e o sol da tarde
batia na colina e lançava sombras compridas e verdes embaixo das árvores.
- Vejam! Vocês estão em Cerin Amroth - disse Haldir. - Este é o coração do reino antigo,
como era outrora; aqui está a Colina de Amroth, onde em dias mais felizes

foi construída sua bela casa. Aqui sempre desabrocham as flores do inverno na relva
sempre igual. As
elanor amarelas e o pálido niphredil. Aqui vamos nos deter um
pouco, para entrar na cidade dos Galaditrim ao anoitecer.
OS Outros se jogaram sobre a relva cheirosa, mas Frodo continuou de pé por uns momentos,
ainda pasmo e admirado. Tinha a impressão de ter atravessado uma janela
alta que dava para um mundo desaparecido. Havia uma luz sobre esse mundo que não podia
ser descrita na língua dele. Tudo o que via parecia harmonioso, mas as formas
pareciam novas, como se tivessem sido concebidas e desenhadas no momento em que lhe
tiraram a venda dos olhos, e ao mesmo tempo antigas, como se tivessem existido
desde sempre. Frodo não viu cores diferentes das que conhecia, dourado e branco e azul e
verde, mas eram novas e pungentes, como se naquele mesmo momento as tivesse
percebido pela primeira vez, dando-lhes nomes novos e maravilhosos. Naquela região, no
inverno, ninguém podia sentir saudade do verão ou da primavera. Não se podia
ver qualquer defeito ou doença ou deformidade em cada uma das coisas que cresciam sobre a
terra. Não havia manchas na terra de Lórien.
Voltou-se e viu que Sam estava parado ao seu lado, olhando em volta com uma expressão
admirada, e esfregando os olhos como se não tivesse certeza de estar acordado.
- Estamos num dia brilhante e pleno de luz, por certo
- disse ele. - Pensei que os elfos preferissem a lua e as estrelas: mas isto aqui é mais
élfico do que qualquer coisa que já ouvi contar. Sinto-me como se estivesse
dentro de uma canção, se o senhor entende o que quero dizer.
Haldir olhou para eles, e parecia realmente entender o que diziam os pensamentos e as
palavras. Sorriu. - Vocês estão sentindo o poder da Senhora dos Galadhrim disse ele. - Gostariam de subir comigo o Cerin Amroth?
#373
Os outros seguiram Haldir enquanto ia subindo pelas encostas cobertas de grama. Embora
estivesse andando e respirando, e à sua volta as folhas vivas se agitassem
com o mesmo vento fresco que lhe batia no rosto, Frodo se sentia como se estivesse numa
terra eterna, que não perdia o viço ou se alterava ou cala no esquecimento.
Quando tivesse partido e entrado outra vez no mundo de fora, Frodo, o andarilho do
Condado, ainda estaria caminhando ali, sobre a relva e por entre os elanor
e niphredil da bela Lothlórien.
Entraram no círculo de árvores brancas. Quando fizeram isso, o Vento Sul soprou sobre
Cerin Amroth e suspirou por entre os galhos. Frodo parou quieto, ouvindo grandes
mares distantes sobre praias que tinham sido levadas havia muito tempo, e o grito de
pássaros marítimos cuja raça já tinha desaparecido da terra.
Haldir tinha ido na frente e agora subia para o altoflet. Quando Frodo se preparava para
segui-lo, colocou a mão sobre a árvore ao lado da escada: nunca antes ele
tinha tido uma consciência tão aguçada e repentina da sensação e da textura de uma casca
de árvore e da vida dentro dela. Sentiu um prazer provocado pela madeira
e pelo seu toque nas mãos, que não era o prazer de um agricultor ou de um carpinteiro,
mas o prazer da própria vida
da árvore.
Quando pisou finalmente na alta plataforma, Haldir pegou sua mão e o virou para o Sul. Olhe para este lado primeiro - disse ele.
Frodo olhou e viu, ainda a certa distância, uma colina com várias arvores
grandes ou uma cidade de torres verdes: o que era exatamente não sabia dizer. Dali lhe
parecia emanar o poder e a luz que mantinham toda aquela região em equilíbrio. Desejou de
repente voar como um pássaro para
desbcansar na cidade verde. Então olhou para o Leste e viu a terra de Lórien descendo até
o brilho claro do Anduin, o Grande Rio. Levantou os olhos acima da linha
do
rio e toda a luz se extinguiu, e ele estava de volta ao mundo que conhecia. Além do rio a
terra parecia plana e vazia, informe e vaga, até que muito na frente se

erguia de novo como uma parede, escura e melancólica. O sol que batia em Lothlórien não
tinha o poder de
iluminar a sombra daquela região alta e distante.
- Ali fica a fortaleza do Sul da Floresta das Trevas
disse Haldir. Está incrustada
numa mata de abetos escuros, onde as árvores lutam umas contra as outras
e seus ramos apodrecem e definham. No meio, sobre uma colina rochosa, fica
Dol Guldur, onde por muito tempo o Inimigo oculto tinha sua moradia. Tememos que agora
esteja habitada outra vez, e com um Poder sete vezes maior. Ultimamente uma nuvem negra
paira sempre sobre ela. Neste lugar alto você poderá ver os dois poderes
que se opõem; e agora ambos sempre lutam através dos pensamentos , mas embora a luz
perceba o próprio coração da escuridão, seu próprio segredo ainda não foi
#374
descoberto. Não por enquanto! - Voltou-se e desceu rapidamente, e os outros o seguiram.
Ao pé da colina Frodo encontrou Aragorn, parado e quieto como uma árvore, mas em sua mão
estava uma pequena flor dourada de elanor, e uma luz brilhava em seus olhos.
Estava envolvido em alguma lembrança antiga: e, olhando para ele, Frodo percebeu que ele
olhava as coisas como elas haviam sido certa vez naquele lugar. Os anos
tristes tinham sido retirados do rosto de Aragorn, que parecia estar vestido de branco,
um senhor alto e belo; ele falava coisas na língua élfica para alguém que
Frodo não podia ver.
Arwen vanimelda, namariê!, disse, a suspirar, e depois regressou do mundo das
recordações, olhou para Frodo e sorriu. ele, e depois respirou fundo. Despertando de
seu devaneio, olhou para Frodo e sorriu.
- Aqui está o coração do Reino Élfico na terra - disse ele - e aqui mora meu coração para
sempre, a menos que haja luz além das estradas escuras que devemos percorrer,
você e eu. Venha comigo! - E, segurando a mão de Frodo, deixou a colina de
Cerin Amroth, para a qual nunca mais retornou em vida.

CAPíTULO VII
O ESPELHO DE GALADRIEL

O sol se escondia por trás das montanhas, e as sombras se aprofundavam na floresta,
quando a Comitiva partiu.
O caminho que trilhavam agora atravessava conjuntos
de árvores onde a escuridão já havia se instalado. A noite surgia por detrás das árvores
quando eles andavam, e os elfos descobriram suas lamparinas prateadas.
De repente chegaram a um espaço aberto outra vez, e se viram sob um claro céu noturno,
salpicado pelas primeiras estrelas. Havia um trecho amplo e sem árvores adiante,
formando um grande círculo com descidas que se estendiam de ambos os lados. Além desse
espaço via-se um fosso profundo, perdido na sombra suave, mas a grama sobre
sua borda era verde, como se ainda brilhasse em memória do sol que já se fora. Mais
adiante, do lado oposto, erguia-se a uma enorme altura uma muralha verde circundando
uma colina verde coberta de pés de mallorn, mais altos do que quaisquer outros que eles
tinham visto naquela região. Não se podia adivinhar sua altura, mas erguiam-se
no crepúsculo como torres vivas. Nas numerosas camadas de galhos e por entre as folhas
que sempre se agitavam, brilhavam incontáveis luzes, verdes, douradas e prateadas.
Haldir voltou-se para a Comitiva.
- Bem-vindos a Caras Galadhon! - disse ele. - Esta é a cidade dos Galadhrim, onde moram o

Celeborn e Galadriel, a Senhora de Lórien. Mas não podemos entrar
por aqui, pois os portões não se abrem para o Norte. Devemos dar a volta chegando pelo
lado Sul, e o caminho não é curto, pois a cidade é grande.
Havia uma estrada pavimentada com pedras brancas percorrendo a borda externa do fosso.
Por ali foram na direção Oeste, com a cidade sempre subindo como uma nuvem
verde à esquerda; à medida que a noite ia chegando, muitas outras luzes se acendiam, até
que toda a colina pareceu estar incendiada de estrelas. Finalmente chegaram
a uma ponte branca, e atravessando-a depararam com os grandes portões da cidade: abriamse para o Sudoeste, e ficavam entre as extremidades da muralha, que ali se
encontravam; eram resistentes e altos, munidos de muitas lamparinas.
Haldir bateu e falou, o que fez com que os portões se abrissem sem qualquer ruído, mas
Frodo não viu nenhum sinal de guardas. Os viajantes entraram e os portões
se fecharam atrás deles. Estavam numa alameda funda entre as extremidades da muralha, e
avançando rapidamente por ela entraram
#376
na Cidade das Arvores. Não viram ninguém, nem escutaram o som de nenhum passo nos
caminhos; mas havia muitas vozes enchendo o ar ao redor e acima deles. Mais
acima, na colina, puderam escutar vozes cantando, que pareciam cair sobre as folhas como
uma chuva
suave.
Continuaram por muitos caminhos, e subiram muitas escadas, até que chegaram às partes
altas e viram adiante, em meio a um vasto gramado, uma fonte tremeluzindo.
Estava iluminada por lamparínas prateadas penduradas aos galhos das árvores, e caía sobre
um vaso de prata, do qual jorrava água cristalina. No lado Sul do gramado
subia a maior de todas as árvores; a copa lisa e grande reluzia como uma seda cinzenta; o
tronco se erguia imponente até que os primeiros galhos, bem em cima, abriam
seus enormes braços sob nuvens de folhas sombreadas. Ao lado ficava uma grande escada
branca, e na base três elfos estavam sentados. Pularam de pé logo que viram
os viajantes se aproximando, e Frodo viu que eram altos e estavam vestindo malhas
metálicas cinzentas, e de seus ombros pendiam mantos longos e brancos.
- Aqui moram Celeborn e Galadriel - disse Haldir. - É o desejo deles que vocês subam para
que possam conversar.
Um dos Guardas Élficos tocou então uma nota límpida numa pequena corneta, ao que uma
outra respondeu em três toques que vinham lá de cima. - Vou primeiro - disse
Haldir. - Deixem que Frodo venha em seguida, e com ele Legolas. Os outros podem nos
seguir na ordem em que desejarem. É uma longa subida para os que não estão acostumados
com este tipo de escada, mas podem descansar durante a escalada.
Ao subir lentamente, Frodo passou por vários flets: alguns de um lado, outros na posição
oposta, e outros ainda colocados na copa da árvore, de
modo que a escada
passava por todos eles. Numa grande altura acima do solo, deparou com um grande talan,
semelhante ao convés de um grande navio. Sobre ele estava construída uma
casa, tão grande que quase poderia ser utilizada como salão para homens no chão. Frodo
entrou atrás de Haldir, e viu-se num
cômodo de formato oval, no meio do qual
crescia o tronco do grande mallorn, nesse ponto se afilando em direçao a coroa, e mesmo
assim formando um pilar bem largo.
O cômodo estava repleto de uma luz suave; as paredes eram verdes e prateadas, o teto era
dourado. Muitos elfos estavam sentados ali. Em duas cadeiras, sob a copa
da árvore e com um ramo vivo à guisa de dossel, estavam sentados, lado a lado,
Celeborn e Galadriel. Levantaram-se para cumprimentar os convidados, como fazem os
elfos, mesmo aqueles tidos como reis poderosos. Eram muito altos, a Senhora não menos que
o Senhor; eram belos e austeros.
Usavam trajes completamente brancos; os cabelos da Senhora

eram de um dourado profundo, e os do Senhor Celeborn eram longos e prateados, mas não se
via nenhum sinal de idade naqueles rostos, a não ser que estivesse na profundeza
dos olhares, que eram agudos como lanças sob a luz das estrelas, e apesar disso
profundos: os poços de profundas recordações.
Haldir conduziu Frodo à presença deles, e o Senhor deu-lhe boas-vindas em sua própria
língua. A Senhora Galadriel não disse uma palavra, mas ficou observando longamente
seu rosto.
- Sente-se agora perto de mim, Frodo do Condado! - disse Celeborn.
- Quando todos tiverem chegado conversaremos juntos.
Cumprimentou cada um dos companheiros de Frodo com cortesia, chamando-os pelo nome quando
entravam. - Bem-vindo, Aragorn, filho de Arathorn! - disse ele. Somam-se trinta e oito anos do mundo lá fora desde que esteve nesta terra, e esses anos
pesam muito para você. Mas o fim está próximo, seja bom seja ruim. Enquanto
estiver
aqui, coloque de lado o fardo que carrega!
- Bem-vindo, filho de Thranduil! Muito raramente meus parentes viajam até aqui, vindos do
Norte.
- Bem-vindo, Gimli, filho de Glóin! Realmente faz muito tempo que vimos alguém do povo de
Durin em Caras
Galadhon. Mas hoje quebramos nossa antiga lei. Que isso
possa ser um sinal de que, embora o mundo esteja escuro atualmente, melhores dias estão
próximos, e de que a amizade entre nossos povos será renovada. Gimli fez uma grande reverência.
Quando todos os convidados estavam sentados diante de sua cadeira, o Senhor olhou-os de
novo. - Aqui estão oito - disse ele. - Nove deveriam ter partido: assim diziam
as mensagens. Mas talvez tenha havido alguma mudança nos planos, sobre a qual não
ouvimos. Eirond está distante, e a escuridão se adensa entre nós; durante todo
este ano as sombras cresceram ainda mais.
- Não, não houve nenhuma mudança nos planos - disse a Senhora Galadriel, falando pela
primeira vez. Tinha uma voz límpida e musical, mas mais grave do que o habitual
para uma mulher. - Gandalf, o Cinzento, partiu com a Comitiva, mas não passou as
fronteiras desta terra. Agora, contem-nos onde está, pois eu desejava muito conversar
com ele outra vez. Mas não posso vê-lo de longe, a não ser que entre nos limites de
Lothlórien: uma grande névoa o envolve, e os caminhos de seus pés e de sua mente
estão ocultos para mim.
- Infelizmente! - disse Aragorn. - Gandalf, o Cinzento, caiu na sombra, Permaneceu em
Moria e não conseguiu escapar.
Ao ouvir essas palavras, todos os elfos no salão choraram de dor e surpresa. - Essa é uma
péssima notícia. A pior que já foi anunciada aqui em
#378
longos anos repletos de acontecimentos tristes. - Voltou-se para Haldir. - Por que nada
disso me foi contado antes? - perguntou ele na língua dos elfos.
- Nós não conversamos com Haldir sobre nossos feitos e propósitos disse Legolas. Primeiro porque estávamos cansados e o perigo estava muito próximo, e depois nós
quase esquecemos nossa dor por um tempo, percorrendo felizes os belos caminhos de Lórien.
- Apesar disso, nosso sofrimento é grande, e nossa perda não pode ser reparada - disse
Frodo. - Gandalf era nosso guia, e nos conduziu através de Moria. Quando nossa
fuga parecia impossível, ele nos salvou, e sucumbiu.
- Conte-nos agora a história inteira - disse Celeborn.
Aragorn contou então tudo o que tinha acontecido na passagem de Caradhras,
e nos dias que se seguiram; falou também de Balin e seu livro, e da luta na Câmara de
e nos dias que se seguiram; falou de Balin e do seu livro, da luta na Câmara de
Mazarbul, do
Mazarbul,"e do fogo, e da ponte estreita, e da chegada do Terror. - Parecia um mal do
Mundo Antigo, que eu nunca tinha visto antes - disse Aragorn. - Era ao mesmo
tempo uma sombra e uma chama, forte e terrível.

- Era um balrog de Morgoth - disse Legolas. -A mais mortal das maldições que afligem os
elfos, com exceção daquele que está na Torre Escura.
- De fato, eu vi sobre a ponte aquele que assombra nossos piores sonhos. Eu vi a Ruína de
Durin - disse
Gimli em voz baixa, com os olhos cheios de terror.
- Isso é muito triste! - disse Celeborn. - Há muito tempo já temíamos que existisse um
terror adormecido sob Caradhras. Mas se eu soubesse que os anões tinham acordado
esse mal em Moria outra vez, teria proibido que você passasse pela fronteira do Norte,
você e todos os que o acompanham. E se isso fosse possível, talvez se pudesse
dizer que Gandalf, no último momento da sabedoria caiu na loucura, entrando sem
necessidade nas entranhas de Moria.
- Dizer isso seria realmente precipitado - disse Galadriel gravemente.
- Nenhum dos feitos de Gandalf foi desnecessário em toda sua vida. Aqueles que o seguiam
não sabiam o que passava pela sua cabeça e não podem prestar contas de seus
propósitos. Mas o que quer que tenha acontecido com o guia, seus seguidores não têm
culpa. Não se arrependa de ter dado boas-vindas ao anão. Se nosso povo estivesse
exilado longe de Lothlórien há muito tempo, quem dos Galadhrim, até mesmo Celeborn o
Sábio, passando perto daqui, não desejaria rever seu antigo lar, mesmo que este
tivesse se tornado um covil de dragões?
- Escuras são as águas do Kheled-zâram, e frias são as nascentes do Kibil-nâla, e belos
eram os salões cheios de pilares de
Khazad-dôm nos Dias Antigos, antes que
poderosos reis caíssem no seio da rocha. - Ela olhou para Gimli, que estava carrancudo e
triste, e sorriu. E o anão, ouvindo os
#379
nomes ditos em sua própria língua antiga, levantou os olhos encontrando os dela, e teve a
impressão de que olhou de repente para o coração de um inimigo e ali viu
amor e compreensão. A admiração cobriu seu rosto, que então sorriu para ela.
Levantou-se desajeitadamente e fez uma reverência ao modo dos anões:
- Apesar disso, mais bela ainda é a terra de Lórien, e a Senhora Galadriel está acima de
todas as jóias que existem sobre a terra!
Fez-se silêncio. Finalmente Celebom falou de novo. - Eu não sabia que sua situação era
tão delicada - disse ele. - Que Gimli esqueça as palavras precipitadas: falei
com o coração confuso. Farei o que puder para ajudá-los, a cada um de acordo com suas
necessidades e desejos, mas especialmente àquele entre os pequenos que carrega
o fardo.
- Sua demanda é conhecida por nós - disse Galadriel, olhando para Frodo. - Mas não
conversaremos sobre ela mais abertamente neste local. Mesmo assim, talvez o fato
de terem vindo até aqui procurando ajuda não terá sido em vão, e fica claro agora que
esses eram os próprios propósitos de Gandalf Pois o Senhor dos Galadhrim é
considerado o mais sábio de todos os elfos da Terra-média, capaz de dar presentes acima
do poder dos mais poderosos reis. Ele mora no Oeste desde os dias da aurora,
e eu já morei com ele por anos sem conta; antes da queda de Nargothrond ou Gondolin, eu
atravessei as montanhas, e juntos, através de eras do mundo, combatemos a
longa derrota.
- Fui eu quem pela primeira vez reuniu o Conselho Branco. E se meus planos não tivessem
falhado, o Conselho teria sido governado por Gandalf, o Cinzento, e então
talvez as coisas tivessem acontecido de outra forma. Mas mesmo assim ainda resta
esperança. Não vou lhes dar conselho, dizendo "façam isto", "façam aquilo". Pois
não é fazendo ou planejando, nem escolhendo entre um ou outro caminho, que posso ser de
ajuda; posso ajudá-los sabendo o que aconteceu e acontece e, em parte, o
que vai acontecer, Mas vou lhes dizer isto: sua Demanda está sobre o fio de
uma faca. Desviem só um pouco do caminho, e nada dará certo, para a ruína de todos.
Mas a esperança ainda permanece, enquanto toda a Comitiva for sincera.
E com essas palavras ela os segurou com seu olhar, e em silêncio ficou olhando e
perscrutando cada um deles, um após o outro. Nenhum, a não ser Legolas e Aragorn,

pôde suportar o olhar da Senhora por muito tempo. Sam corou rapidamente e baixou a
cabeça.
Finalmente a Senhora Galadriel os liberou de seus olhos e sorriu. Não permitam que seus
corações fiquem consternados - disse ela. - Esta noite dormirão em paz. Então eles suspiraram e se sentiram subitamente cansados, como alguém que tivesse sido
interrogado longa e detalhadamente, embora nenhuma palavra tivesse sido pronunciada.
#380
- Podem ir agora! - disse Celeborn. - Vocês estão exaustos com tanta tristeza e de tanto
caminharem. Mesmo que sua Demanda não nos interessasse muito, vocês teriam
refúgio nesta Cidade, até que estivessem curados e reconfortados. Agora devem descansar,
e vamos evitar de falar, por um tempo, da estrada que os espera.
Naquela noite, a Comitiva dormiu sobre o chão, para a grande satisfação dos hobbits. Os
elfos ergueram para eles um pavilhão entre as árvores perto da fonte, e colocaram
ali colchões macios; então, pronunciando palavras de paz com belas vozes élficas,
deixaram-nos. Por alguns momentos, os hobbits conversaram sobre a noite anterior
na copa das árvores e sobre a viagem daquele dia, e sobre o Senhor e a Senhora, pois
ainda não tinham tido a coragem de lembrar o que tinha ficado mais para trás.
- Por que você corou, Sam? - perguntou Pippin. - Você logo desabou. Qualquer um teria
pensado que você estava com a consciencia pesada. Espero que não seja nada
além de um plano maldito para roubar um de meus cobertores.
- Nunca pensei em nada disso - respondeu Sam, que não estava disposto para brincadeiras.
- Se quer saber a verdade, eu me senti como se estivesse nu, e não gostei
disso. Parecia que ela estava olhando dentro de mim e me perguntando o que eu faria se me
fosse dada a chance de fugir de volta para casa no Condado, para
uma toca
pequena e agradável, com... com um pedaço de jardim que fosse meu.
- É engraçado - disse Merry. - Quase o mesmo que eu senti; só que, só que... bem, acho
que não vou falar mais nada - acrescentou ele sem jeito. Todos eles pareciam
ter tido uma experiência semelhante: cada um
sentiu que se lhe oferecia uma escolha entre uma sombra cheia de medo, que se encontrava
lá na frente, e alguma coisa profundamente desejada, que se apresentava
clara aos olhos do espírito, e que para tê-la bastava desviar-se da estrada e deixar a
Demanda e a guerra contra Sauron para outros.
- Tive também a sensação - disse Gimli - de que minha escolha permaneceria em segredo e
seria apenas de meu próprio conhecimento.
- Para mim pareceu muito estranho - disse Boromir. - Talvez tenha sido apenas um teste, e
ela pensou em ler nossos pensamentos para seus próprios propósitos. Mas
quase poderia dizer que ela estava nos tentando, e oferecendo o que ela fingia ter o
poder de nos dar. Não é preciso dizer que me recusei a escutar. Os homens de
Minas Tirith dizem palavras verdadeiras. - Mas o que ele achava que a Senhora tinha lhe
oferecido, Boromir não disse.
Quanto a Frodo, não dizia nada, embora Boromir o pressionasse com perguntas. - Ela o
fitou por mais tempo, Portador do Anel - disse ele.
#381
- Sim - disse Frodo -, mas o que quer que tenha entrado em minha mente, lá deve ficar.
- Bem, tenha cuidado! - disse Boromir. - Não me sinto muito seguro a respeito dessa
Senhora Élfica e de seus propósitos.
- Não fale mal da Senhora Galadriel! - disse Aragorn com severidade. - Você não sabe o
que está dizendo. Não existe maldade nela ou nesta terra, a não ser que um
homem o traga aqui ele mesmo. Se for assim, que ele tome cuidado! Mas esta noite poderei
dormir sem medo pela primeira vez desde que deixei Valfenda. E poderei dormir
profundamente, e esquecer um pouco meu sofrimento! Sinto o coração e o corpo cansados. Jogouse sobre seu colchão e adormeceu imediatamente, num longo sono.

Os outros logo fizeram o mesmo, e nenhum som ou sonho perturbaram seu sono. Quando
acordaram, viram que a luz do dia se espalhava sobre a grama diante do pavilhão,
e a fonte subia e caía, reluzindo ao sol.
Permaneceram alguns dias em Lothlórien, pelo que puderam dizer ou lembrar. Durante todo o
tempo em que moraram ali, o sol brilhou intensamnte, a não ser por uma
chuva suave que às vezes caía e passava, deixando todas as coisas novas e limpas.
O ar era fresco e suave, como no início da primavera; apesar disso, sentiam ao
redor a quietude profunda e pensativa do inverno. Tinham a impressão de que faziam pouca
coisa além de comer e beber e descansar, e caminhar por entre as árvores,
e isso era o suficiente.
Não tinham visto o Senhor e a Senhora outra vez, e tinham pouca conversa com os elfos,
pois poucos deles sabiam ou usavam a língua Westron. Haldir lhes acenara um
adeus e retornara para as fronteiras no Norte, onde uma grande guarda estava montada
desde que a Comitiva trouxera as notícias sobre Moria. Legolas estava distante,
com os Galadhrim, e depois da primeira noite não dormiu com os outros companheiros,
embora voltasse para comer e conversar com eles. Sempre levava Gimli consigo
quando ia passear pelo lugar, e os outros ficaram surpresos com essa mudança.
Agora, quando os companheiros se sentavam ou passeavam, conversavam sobre Gandalf e tudo
o que cada um tinha descoberto ou observado nele ficava claro em suas mentes.
À medida que se curavam da dor e do cansaço do corpo, o sofrimento pela perda ficava
mais intenso. Freqüentemente escutavam por perto vozes élficas cantando, e
sabiam que eles estavam fazendo canções de pesar por sua perda, pois podiam entender o
nome dele entre as doces palavras tristes que não conseguiam captar.
Mithrandir, Mithrandir, cantavam os elfos, Oh, Cinzento Peregrino! Pois assim gostavam de
chamá-lo. Mas mesmo quando Legolas estava com a Comitiva, não interpretava
as canções para eles, dizendo que não tinha
#382
habilidade para isso, e que para ele o sofrimento ainda era muito recente, um assunto
para lágrimas e não ainda para canções.
Foi Frodo quem primeiro colocou alguma coisa de sua mágoa em palavras pausadas. Raramente
sentia vontade de fazer uma cançao ou uma rima; mesmo quando estava em
Valfenda, tinha escutado mas não as cantava, embora sua memória estivesse repleta de
muitas coisas que outros tinham feito antes dele. Mas agora, sentado ao lado
da fonte de Lórien e escutando ao redor as vozes dos elfos, seu pensamento tomou forma
numa canção que lhe parecia bonita; apesar disso, quando tentava repeti-la
para Sam, apenas pequenos trechos permaneciam, apagados como um monte de folhas murchas.
Na noite escura do Condado seus pés se ouviram na Colina; sem sol, sem lua partiu calado
em viagem longa sibilina.
Das Terras Ermas até o Ocidente, do monte Sul ao vazio Norte, passando por dragão
ardente,
na mata escura andou sua sorte.
Homens, elfos, hobbits, anões, mortais criaturas e imortais, ave em galho, fera em
grotões, interpelou com seus sinais.
O dorso curvo sob sua carga,
a mão que cura, o fio da espada, voz de clarim, do,fogo a marca, um peregrino só na
estrada.
Um senhor sábio entronizado, de fácil ira e riso bom,
um velho de chapéu surrado, curvado sobre seu bordão.
De pé na ponte estava só,
a Fogo e Sombra em desafio; quebrou o bordão de encontro à mó em Khazad-dúm seufim se
viu.
#383
- Veja só, logo o senhor estará superando o Sr. Bilbo! - disse Sam.
- Não, receio que não - disse Frodo. - Mas isto é o melhor que pude fazer até agora.

- Bem, Sr. Frodo, se fizer outra tentativa, espero que diga alguma coisa sobre os fogos disse Sam. - Alguma coisa assim:
Dosfogos todos os mais lindos, em mil estrelas explodindo, após trovões com aguaceiros,
caíam qual chuva de canteiros.
- Embora isso não faça justiça a eles, nem de longe.
- Não, vou deixar essa parte por sua conta, Sam. Ou talvez ao encargo de Bilbo... Bem,
não consigo mais falar disso agora. Não consigo suportar a idéia de dar-lhe
a notícia.
Uma tarde, Frodo e Sam estavam caminhando juntos no fresco crepúsculo. Ambos se sentiam
inquietos de novo. De repente, a sombra da partida havia caído sobre Frodo:
sabia de alguma forma que estava bem próximo o momento de deixar Lothlórien.
- Que acha dos elfos agora, Sam? - perguntou ele. - Já lhe fiz esta mesma pergunta uma
vez antes... Agora parece há muito tempo, mas desde aquela época você viu
mais coisas sobre eles.
- Realmente vi - disse Sam. - E acho que existem elfos e elfos. Todos são bastante
élficos, mas não são todos iguais. Agora estas pessoas não são andarilhos sem
lar, e parecem um pouco mais conosco: parecem pertencer a este lugar, mais ainda que os
hobbits pertencem ao Condado. Se fizeram a terra ou a terra os fez é dificil
dizer, se entende o que quero dizer. Aqui tudo é maravilhosamente silencioso. Parece que
nada está acontecendo, e parece que ninguém quer que nada aconteça. Se existe
alguma mágica, está muito bem escondida, num lugar que não posso alcançar com as mãos,
por assim dizer.
- Você pode senti-la e vê-Ia em todo lugar - disse Frodo.
- Bem - disse Sam -, não se pode ver ninguém operando a mágica. Nenhum fogo de artifício
como aqueles do pobre Gandalf. Fico surpreso em não termos encontrado o
Senhor e a Senhora durante todos esses dias. Imagino agora que ela poderia fazer algumas
coisas maravilhosas, se tivesse vontade. Eu adoraria ver alguma mágica élfica,
Sr. Frodo.
- Eu não! - disse Frodo. - Estou satisfeito. Não sinto falta dos fogos de
Gandalf, mas das suas sobrancelhas grossas, de seu humor instável, e da sua voz.
#384
- Está certo - disse Sam. - E não pense que estou colocando defeito. Sempre quis ver um
pouco de mágica como aquela que se conta nas histórias antigas, mas nunca
ouvi falar de uma terra melhor que esta. É como estar em casa e de férias ao mesmo tempo,
se entende o que quero dizer, Não quero partir. Mesmo assim, estou começando
a sentir que, se temos de continuar, então é melhor irmos logo.
- O trabalho que nunca se começa é o que mais demora para terminar, como dizia meu velho
pai. E não acho que este povo pode fazer muito mais para nos ajudar, seja
através de mágica ou não. Acho que quando deixarmos esta terra é que sentiremos mais
falta de
Gandalf.
- Receio que esteja absolutamente certo, Sam - disse Frodo. - Mas espero do fundo do
coração que, antes de partirmos, possamos ver a Senhora dos elfos outra vez.
No momento em que falava, os dois viram, como se viesse em resposta àquelas palavras, a
Senhora Galadriel se aproximando. Alta, bela e branca, caminhava por entre
as árvores. Não disse nada, mas acenou para eles.
Mudando de direção, conduziu-os para a encosta Sul da colina de Caras
Galadhon, e, atravessando uma cerca-viva alta e verde, eles chegaram a um jardim fechado.
Ali não crescia nenhuma árvore e o jardim se abria para o céu. A estrela da tarde tinha
subido e brilhava num fogo branco sobre a floresta do Oeste. Descendo um
longo lance de escadas, a Senhora entrou numa concavidade funda e verde, através da qual
corria murmurando a água prateada que jorrava da fonte na colina. Embaixo,
sobre o pedestal pequeno entalhado como uma árvore cheia de ramos, ficava uma bacia de
prata, larga e rasa, e ao lado dela se via um jarro de prata.
Com a água do riacho, Galadriel encheu a bacia até a borda, e soprou sobre ela; quando a
água estava parada novamente, ela falou. - Este é o Espelho de Galadriel

- disse ela. - Trouxe-os aqui para que possam examiná-lo, se quiserem.
O ar estava quieto e o vale, escuro; a senhora élfica, ao lado de Frodo, era alta e
pálida. - Que vamos procurar, e o que vamos ver? - perguntou Frodo, cheio de
assombro.
- Posso ordenar ao Espelho que revele muitas coisas - respondeu ela.
- E para algumas pessoas posso mostrar o que desejam ver. Mas o Espelho também revelará
fatos que não foram ordenados, e estes são sempre mais estranhos e compensadores
do que as coisas que desejamos ver. O que você verá, se permitir que o Espelho trabalhe
livremente, não posso dizer. Pois ele revela coisas já passadas, coisas que
estão acontecendo, e as que ainda podem acontecer. Mas o que ele vê, nem mesmo o mais
sábio pode dizer. Você deseja olhar?
Frodo não respondeu.
#385
- E você? - disse ela, voltando-se para Sam. - Isto é o que seu povo chamaria de mágica,
eu acho, embora não entenda claramente o que querem dizer, além do fato
de ele usarem, ao que parece, a mesma palavra para os artificios do Inimigo. Mas esta, se
você quiser, é a mágica de Galadriel. Você não tinha dito que queria ver
alguma mágica élfica?
- É sim - disse Sam, oscilando um pouco entre o medo e a curiosidade, - Vou dar uma
espiada, Senhora, se me permitir.
- E eu não me importaria em dar uma olhada no que está acontecendo em casa - disse ele à
parte para Frodo. - Parece que já faz um tempo terrivelmente longo que estou
fora. Mas lá, provavelmente só vou ver as estrelas, ou alguma coisa que não conseguirei
entender.
- Provavelmente - disse a Senhora com um sorriso suave. - Mas venha, você vai olhar e ver
o que puder. Não toque na água!
Sam subiu no pedestal e se inclinou sobre a bacia. A água tinha uma aparência sólida e
escura. Estrelas estavam refletidas na superficie.
- Só vejo estrelas, como já imaginava - disse ele. Então teve um pequeno sobressalto,
pois as estrelas desapareceram. Como se um véu escuro tivesse sido retirado,
o Espelho ficou cinza, e depois transparente. Ali o sol brilhava e os galhos das árvores
ondulavam e se agitavam ao vento. Mas antes que Sam pudesse perceber o que
tinha visto, a luz se apagou; e agora elejulgava ver Frodo deitado num sono profundo sob
um penhasco escuro. Então teve a impressão de estar se vendo entrar por
uma passagem ensombreada, e subindo uma escada sinuosa que não tinha fim. Teve a sensação
de estar procurando desesperadamente alguma coisa, mas o que era não conseguiu
saber, Como num sonho, a visão mudou e se transformou na anterior, e ele viu as árvores
outra vez. Mas desta vez não estavam tão próximas, e Sam pôde ver o que estava
acontecendo: as árvores não estavam se agitando ao vento, estavam caindo, batendo contra
o chão.
- Olha só! - gritou Sam numa voz enraivecida. - Estou vendo Ted Ruivào cortando árvores,
e ele não devia. Elas não devem ser derrubadas: é aquela alameda para lá
do moinho que faz sombra na estrada para Beirágua. Gostaria de pegar e derrubar ele!
Mas agora Sam notava que o Velho Moinho tinha desaparecido, e um grande edificio de
tijolos vermelhos estava sendo construido no lugar dele. Bandos de pessoas trabalhavam
sem parar. Havia uma chaminé alta e vermelha ao lado. Uma fumaça preta pareceu cobrir a
superficie do Espelho.
- Há alguma maldade sendo feita no Condado - disse ele. - Eirond sabia o que estava
dizendo quando quis mandar o Sr. Merry de volta. - Então, de repente, Sam deu
um grito e pulou para trás. - Não posso ficar aqui disse ele alucinado. - Preciso ir para
casa. Eles cavaram a rua do Bolsinho, e estou vendo meu pobre e velho pai
descendo a Colina com suas coisas num carrinho de mão. Preciso ir para casa!

- Você não pode ir para casa sozinho - disse a Senhora. - Você não desejava ir para casa
sem seu patrão, antes de olhar no Espelho, e mesmo assim sabia que coisas
horríveis podiam muito bem estar acontecendo no Condado. Lembre-se de que o Espelho
revela muitas coisas, e nem todas já aconteceram. Algumas nunca chegam a acontecer,
a não ser que aqueles que as vêem desviem de seu caminho para impedi-las. O Espelho é um
guia perigoso para a ação. - Sam sentou-se no chão e cobriu o rosto com
as mãos. - Gostaria de nunca ter vindo aqui, e não quero mais ver nenhuma mágica - disse
ele, e então emudeceu. Depois de um momento, falou numa voz espessa, como
se lutasse contra as lágrimas. - Não, vou para casa pela estrada longa com o Sr. Frodo,
ou não vou - disse ele. - Mas espero realmente voltar algum dia. Se o que
vi no Espelho vier a acontecer de verdade, alguém vai pagar muito caro por isso!
- Deseja olhar, Frodo? - disse a Senhora Galadriel. - Você não queria ver nenhuma mágica
élfica, e estava satisfeito.
A Senhora me aconselha a olhar? - perguntou Frodo.
Não - disse ela. - Não aconselho nada. Não sou uma conselheira. Você pode aprender alguma
coisa e, quer as coisas que verá sejam boas quer sejam más, a visão pode
ser compensadora, ou não. Ver é ao mesmo tempo bom e perigoso. Apesar disso, eu acho,
Frodo, que você tem a coragem e a sabedoria suficientes para se arriscar, caso
contrário não o teria trazido aqui. Faça como quiser!
- Vou olhar - disse Frodo, subindo ao pedestal e se curvando sobre a água escura.
Imediatamente o Espelho ficou transparente e mostrou uma região pouco iluminada.
Montanhas assomavam escuras na distância, contra o céu pálido. Uma longa estrada cinzenta
recuava, descrevendo curvas, até se perder de vista. Na distância se via
uma figura, vindo lentamente pela estrada, apagada e pequena no início, mas ficando cada
vez maior e mais nítida conforme se aproximava. De repente Frodo percebeu
que a figura o fazia lembrar de Gandalf. Quase gritou o nome do mago, então viu que o
vulto estava vestido não de cinza, mas de branco, um branco que emitia uma
luz opaca no crepúsculo, e que sua mão segurava um cajado branco. A cabeça estava tão
curvada que não se podia ver o rosto, e naquele momento a figura enveredou
por uma curva da estrada e desapareceu da visão do Espelho. A mente de Frodo ficou cheia
de dúvidas: seria uma visão de Gandalf em uma de suas longas viagens solitárias
de antigamente, ou seria aquela a figura de Saruman?
Depois disso a visão mudou. Numa imagem vívida, embora pequena e rápida, ele enxergou de
relance Bilbo andando inquieto de um lado para o outro de seu quarto. A
mesa estava carregada de papéis em desordem; uma chuva batia nas janelas.
#387
Então se fez uma pausa; depois muitas cenas rápidas se seguiram e Frodo sabia, de alguma
forma, que eram partes de uma grande
história na qual estava envolvido.
A névoa se desfez e ele teve uma visão que não conhecía, mas identificou imediatamente: o
Mar. Escureceu. O mar se levantou e se enfureceu numa grande tempestade.
Então Frodo viu, contra o sol que afundava num vermelho-sangue em meio a um torvelinho de
nuvens, o contorno negro de um navio alto com as velas rasgadas, que vinha
navegando do Oeste. Depois, um rio largo correndo através de uma cidade populosa. Depois,
uma fortaleza branca com sete torres. Depois, de novo, um navio com velas
negras, mas agora era manhã de novo, e a água fazia ondas na luz, e uma bandeira levando
o emblema de uma árvore branca brilhava ao sol. Subiu uma fumaça de fogo
e batalha, e outra vez o sol se pôs num vermelho ígneo que se apagou numa névoa cinzenta;
entrando na névoa passou uma pequena embarcação, piscando com muitas luzes.
Sumiu e Frodo suspirou, preparando-se para descer.
Mas, de repente, o Espelho ficou totalmente escuro, como se um buraco se abrisse no mundo
da visão, e Frodo olhasse no vazio. No abismo negro apareceu um único Olho
que cresceu lentamente, até cobrir quase toda a extensão do Espelho. Tão terrível era
aquela visão que Frodo ficou colado ao solo, sem poder gritar ou desviar o
olhar. O Olho estava emoldurado por fogo, mas era ele mesmo que reluzia, amarelo como o
de um gato, vigilante e atento, e a fenda negra de sua pupila era um abismo,
umajanela que se abria para o nada.

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Então o Olho começou a se movimentar, procurando algo de um lado e de outro, e Frodo
percebeu, com medo e certeza, que ele próprio era uma das muitas coisas que
estavam sendo procuradas. Mas também percebeu que não podia ser visto - por enquanto, a
não ser que o desejasse. O Anel que estava pendurado na corrente em seu pescoço
ficou pesado, mais pesado que uma pedra, fazendo a cabeça pender para baixo. O Espelho
parecia estar ficando quente, e nuvens de vapor subiam da água. Frodo estava
escorregando para frente.
- Não toque na água! - disse a Senhora Galadriel num tom suave. A visão desvaneceu-se e
Frodo se viu olhando para as estrelas frias que piscavam na bacia de prata.
Recuou tremendo e olhou para a Senhora.
- Sei o que voce viu por último - disse ela -, pois está também em minha mente. Não tenha
medo! Mas não pense que é apenas cantando por entre as árvores, ou só por
meio de flechas frágeis e arcos élficos que nós da terra de Lothlórien nos defendemos e
nos guardamos do Inimigo. Digo a você, Frodo, que neste exato momento em
que conversamos eu percebo o Senhor do Escuro e sei o que se passa na mente dele, ou pelo
menos tudo que se relaciona aos elfos. E ele sempre se insinua para me
ver e ler meus Pensamentos. Mas a porta ainda está fechada.
#388
Levantou os braços brancos, e estendeu as mãos na direção Leste num gesto de rejeição
e recusa. Eärendil , a Estrela da Tarde, a mais amada pelos elfos, emanava do
céu um brilho. Tão claro era o brilho que a silhueta da Senhora Élfica lançava uma sombra
apagada sobre o chão. Os raios da
estrela reluziram sobre um anel em seu
dedo, que cintilou como ouro polido coberto com luz prateada, e a pedra branca que havia
nele piscou como se a Estrela da Tarde tivesse descido para descansar na
mão dela. Frodo olhou para o anel admirado, pois de repente teve a impressão de que
compreendia tudo.
- Sim - disse ela, adivinhando o que ele pensava. - Não é permitido falar disso, e Elrond
não o faria. Mas não se pode esconder do Portador do Anel, e de alguém
que tenha visto o Olho. É verdade, na terra de Lórien, no dedo de Galadriel, permanece um
dos Três. Este é
Nenya, o Anel de Adamante, do qual sou guardiã.
- Ele suspeita, mas não sabe... ainda não. Entende agora por que sua vinda aqui
representa para nós a passada do Destino? Pois, se você falhar, então seremos expostos
ao Inimigo, e Lothlórien desaparecerá, e as marés do tempo a levarão embora. Partiremos
para o Oeste, ou seremos reduzidos a
um povo rústico de vale e caverna,
para lentamente esquecermos e sermos esquecidos.
Frodo deixou cair a cabeça. - E o que a Senhora deseja? - perguntou ele
finalmente.
- Que aconteça o que deve acontecer - respondeu ela. - O amor dos elfos por sua terra e
seus trabalhos é mais profundo que as profundezas do Mar, sua tristeza é
eterna e nunca poderá ser completamente abrandada. Mesmo assim, jogarão tudo fora se a
outra opção for a submissão a Sauron: pois agora os elfos o conhecem. Você
não deve responder pelo destino de Lothlórien, mas apenas pelo desempenho de sua própria
tarefa. Apesar disso, eu poderia desejar que, se isso adiantasse de alguma
coisa, o Um Anel nunca tivesse sido forjado, ou que continuasse perdido para sempre.
- A Senhora Galadriel é sábia, destemida e bela - disse Frodo. - Darlhe-ei o
Um Anel se assim o desejar. Esse peso é demais para mim. Galadriel riu, com uma risada
súbita e cristalina. - Sábia, a Senhora
Galadriel pode ser - disse ela -, mas aqui ela encontrou alguém que está à sua altura em
cortesia. De um modo gentil, você se vingou do teste que apliquei ao seu
coração em nosso primeiro encontro. Agora começa a enxergar com olhos agudos. Não vou
negar que meu coração desejou muito pedir o que está oferecendo. Por muitos
longos anos, pensei o que faria, caso o Grande Anel me chegasse às mãos, e veja! Ele está
agora ao meu alcance. O mal que foi concebido há muito tempo continua agindo

de muitas maneiras, quer o próprio Sauron seja ou não derrotado. Não teria sido
#389
uma ação nobre a ser creditada ao Anel dele, se eu o tivesse tomado à força ou ameaçando
meu hóspede?
- E agora finalmente ele chega. Você me oferece o Anel livremente! No lugar do Senhor do
Escuro, você coloca uma Rainha. E não serei escura, mas bela e terrível
como a Manhã e a Noite! Bela como o Mar e o Sol e a Neve sobre a Montanha! Aterrorizante
cono a Tempestade e o Trovão! Mais forte que os fundamentos da terra. Todos
deverão me amar e se desesperar!
Levantou a mão e do anel que usava emanou uma grande luz que iluminou a ela somente,
deixando todo o resto escuro. Ficou diante de Frodo e parecia agora de uma altura
incalculável, e de uma beleza insuportável, terrível e digna de adoração. Depois deixou a
mão cair, e a luz se apagou; e de repente ela riu de novo e eis então que
se encolheu: era uma mulher élfica frágil, vestida num traje simples e branco, cuja voz
gentil era suave e triste.
- Passei pelo teste - disse ela. - Vou diminuir e me dirigir para o Oeste, continuando a
ser Galadriel.
Ficaram em silêncio por um longo tempo. Finalmente a Senhora falou outra vez. - Vamos
voltar! - disse ela. -Amanhã cedo você deve partir, pois agora já fizemos nossa
escolha, e as marés do tempo estão fluindo, Gostaria de perguntar uma coisa antes de
irmos - disse Frodo. Algo
que sempre quis perguntar a Gandalf em Valtenda. Tendo a permissão de usar o Um Anel, por
que
não posso ver todos os outros anéis e adivinhar os pensamentos daqueles que os usam"?
Você ainda não tentou - disse ela. - Apenas três vezes colocou o Anel em seu dedo, desde
que soube que o possuía, Não tente! Ele o destruiria. Gandalf não lhe disse
que os anéis concedem poderes de acordo com a capacidade de cada um que os possui? Antes
que você pudesse usar esse poder, sentiria a necessidade de ficar muito
mais forte, e treinar sua vontade em relação ao domínio dos outros. Mas mesmo assim, como
Portador do Anel e um daqueles que o colocou no dedo e viu o que está oculto,
sua visão ficou mais aguçada. Percebeu meus pensamentos muito melhor que
várias pessoas consideradas sábias, Viu o Olho daquele que controla os Sete e os Nove.
E não viu e reconheceu o Anel em meu dedo? Você viu meu anel? - perguntou ela, voltandose para Sam.
- Não, Senhora - respondeu ele. - Para falar a verdade, estava me perguntando sobre o que
conversavam. Vi uma estrela através de seu dedo. Mas, se perdoa o que
vou dizer, acho que meu patrão está certo. Eu gostaria que a Senhora ficasse com o Anel
dele. Poderia pôr as coisas no lugar certo. Impediria que eles expulsassem
meu pai e o deixassem perdido por aí, Faria com que certas pessoas pagassem pelo serviço
sujo que
fizeram.
- Eu faria - disse ela. - É assim que tudo começaria. Mas infelizmente não pararia ali.
Não falemos mais nisso. Vamos!

#CAPITULO VIII
ADEUS A LóRIEN

Naquela noite, a Comitiva foi chamada outra vez ao salão de Celeborn, e ali o Senhor e a
Senhora os cumprimentaram com belas palavras. Finalmente, Celeborn falou
da partida deles.

- É chegada a hora - disse ele - em que aqueles que desejam continuar a Demanda devem
endurecer seus corações e deixar esta terra. Aqueles que não mais desejam prosseguir
podem permanecer aqui, por um tempo. Mas quer fiquem quer partam, a paz não pode ser
assegurada. Pois chegamos agora ao limiar de nosso destino. Aqui, aqueles que
desejarem podem esperar a aproximação da hora em que ou os caminhos do mundo se abrirão
de novo, ou os convocaremos para a luta suprema de Lórien. Então poderão
voltar às suas terras, ou ir para a morada duradoura daqueles que caem na batalha.
Fez-se silêncio. - Todos resolveram partir - disse Galadriel, olhando nos olhos deles.
- Quanto a mim - disse Boromir
meu lar fica adiante, e não lá atrás.
- Isso é verdade - disse Celeborn
mas toda a Comitiva vai com você para Minas
Tirith?
- Ainda não decidimos nosso caminho - disse Aragorn. - Depois de Lórien, não sei o que
Gandalf pretendia fazer. Na verdade, acho que nem ele tinha um propósito definido.
- Talvez não - disse Celeborn -, mas mesmo assim, quando deixarem este lugar, não poderão
mais esquecer o Grande Rio. Como alguns de vocês bem sabem, os viajantes
não podem atravessá-lo com bagagens entre Lórien e Gondor, a não ser de barco. E não
estão as pontes de Osgiliath destruídas, e todos os desembarcadouros sob o domínio
do Inimigo?
- De que lado vão viajar? O caminho para Minas Tirith fica deste lado, no Oeste; mas a
estrada da Demanda fica do lado Leste do Rio, na margem mais escura. Que margem
pegarão agora?
- Se meu conselho for acatado, iremos pela margem Oeste, e pelo caminho de Minas Tirith respondeu Boromir. - Mas não sou o líder da Comitiva. - Os outros não disseram
nada, e Aragorn parecia preocupado e cheio de dúvidas.
- Vejo que ainda não sabem o que fazer - disse Celeborn. - Não é meu papel fazer essa
escolha em seu lugar; mas vou ajudá-los como puder. Alguns entre vocês sabem
lidar com barcos: Legolas, cujo povo conhece o veloz Rio da Floresta, Boromir de Gondor,
e Aragorn, o viajante.
#392
- E um hobbit! - gritou Merry. - Nem todos nós achamos que um barco é como um cavalo
xucro. Meu povo mora às margens do Brandevin.
- Isso está bem - disse Celeborn, - Então providenciarei barcos para a sua Comitiva.
Devem ser pequenos e leves, pois se avançarem muito pela água haverá lugares
onde serão forçados a carregá-los. Chegarão às correntezas do Sarn Gebir, e talvez
finalmente às grandes cachoeiras de Rauros, onde o Rio cai vertiginosamente do
Nen Hithoel; e há outros perigos. Os barcos podem fazer com que sua viagem seja menos
penosa durante um certo trecho. Apesar disso, eles não vão ajudá-los a decidir:
no fim, devem abandoná-los e ao Rio, e rumar para o Oeste - ou para o Leste.
Aragorn agradeceu a Celeborn várias vezes. A doação dos barcos o consolou por vários
motivos, e não menos por agora poderem postergar por mais uns dias a decisão
sobre qual caminho seguir. Os outros, da mesma forma, pareciam mais esperançosos.
Quaisquer que fossem os perigos à frente, parecia melhor descer flutuando a larga
correnteza do Anduin para enfrentá-los, do que prosseguir num caminho penoso com as
costas arcadas. Apenas Sam ainda tinha dúvidas: ele, de qualquer forma, considerava
que os barcos eram como cavalos selvagens, ou piores, e nem todos os perígos pelos quais
tinha passado mudavam sua idéia a esse respeito.
- Prepararemos tudo, e vocês serão esperados no porto antes do meiodia amanhã - disse
Celeborn. - Enviarei pessoas pela manhã para que possam ajudá-los
nos preparativos da viagem. Agora desejamos-lhes uma boa noite e um sono tranqüilo.
- Boa noite, meus amigos! - disse Galadriel. - Durmam em paz! Esta noite, não
sobrecarreguem seus coraçóes pensando no melhor caminho. Pode ser que as trilhas nas
quais cada um de vocês deve pisar já estejam diante de seus pés, embora talvez não
consigam enxergá-las. Boa noite!
A Comitiva saiu e voltou para o pavilhão. Legolas os acompanhou, pois aquela deveria ser
a última noite deles em Lothlórien, e apesar das palavras de Galadriel todos
queriam ficar juntos para planejar a viagem.

Por um longo tempo, debateram sobre o que deveriam fazer, e sobre o melhor modo de tentar
atingir seus propósitos em relação ao Anel; mas não chegaram a decisão
alguma. Estava claro que a maioria deles desejava ir primeiro até Minas Tirith e escapar,
pelo menos por um tempo, do terror do Inimigo. Estariam dispostos a seguir
um líder através do Rio e para dentro da sombra de Mordor; mas Frodo não dizia nada e
Aragorn ainda estava dividido.
Seu próprio plano, enquanto Gandalf ainda estava com eles, era ir com Boromir e, com sua
espada, ajudar a libertar Gondor. Pois ele acreditava que a mensagem dos
sonhos era um chamado, e que tinha chegado finalmente
#393
a hora em que o herdeiro de Elendil deveria se apresentar e lutar contra Sauron pelo
comando. Mas em Moria o fardo de Gandalf passara para seus ombros, e ele sabia
que não podia agora abandonar o Anel, se Frodo finalmente se recusasse a acompanhar
Boromír. Apesar disso, que ajuda poderia ele ou qualquer um da Comitiva prestar
a Frodo, a não ser caminhar ao seu lado para dentro da escuridão?
- irei para Minas Tirith, mesmo que vá sozinho, pois este é meu dever
- disse Boromir, e depois ficou calado por um tempo, sentado com os olhos fixos em Frodo,
como se tentasse ler os pensamentos do Pequeno. Finalmente falou de novo,
numa voz suave, como se estivesse discutindo consigo mesmo. - Se você quer apenas
destruir o Anel - disse ele - então não haverá muita utilidade na guerra e nas
armas, e os homens de Minas Tirith não poderão ser de grande ajuda. Mas se você deseja
destruir a força armada do Senhor do Escuro, então é tolice avançar pelos
domínios dele sem armas; é tolice jogar fora... - parou de repente, como se tivesse
percebido que estava pensando em voz alta. - Seria tolice jogar fora vidas, quero
dizer - terminou ele. - É uma escolha entre defender um lugar forte e caminhar
abertamente para os braços da morte. Pelo menos é assim que vejo as coisas.
Frodo percebeu algo novo e estranho no olhar de Boromir, e olhou-o fixamente. Estava
claro que o pensamento de Boromir divergia de suas últimas palavras, Seria
tolice jogar fora: o quê? O Anel de Poder? Ele tinha dito algo semelhante no Conselho,
mas na ocasião aceitara a correção de Elrond. Frodo olhou para Aragorn, mas
este parecia estar mergulhado em seus próprios pensamentos, e não fez sinal de que
prestara atenção às palavras de BOrOmir. E assim a discussão terminou. Merry
e Pippinjá estavam dormindo, e Sam caindo de sono. A noite avançava.
Pela manhã, enquanto arrumavam sua sumária bagagem, vieram elfos que sabiam falar a
língua deles e trouxeram-lhes muitos presentes em forma de comida e roupas
para a viagem. A comida era, na maior parte, composta de bolos muito finos, feitos
de uma farinha que, assada, era de um tom marrom-claro, e na parte interna tinha
cor de creme. Gimli pegou um dos bolos e olhou-o com um ar duvidoso.
- Cram - disse ele numa voz muito baixa, enquanto quebrava um canto crocante e o
mordiscava. Mas a expressão em seu rosto mudou rapidamente, e ele comeu todo o resto do
bolo, com grande apetite.
- Basta, basta! - gritaram os elfos rindo. - Você já comeu o suficiente para um dia longo
de marcha.
- Pensei que era apenas um tipo de gram, semelhante àquele que os homens de Valle fazem
para levar em viagens a lugares desertos - disse o anão.
#394
- E é - responderam eles. - Mas nós o chamamos de lembas ou pão-de-viagem, e é mais
nutritivo que qualquer comida feita pelos homens, e mais saboroso que o cram,
pelo que todos dizem.
- De fato é - disse gimli. - E olhe, é melhor até que os pães-de-mel dos Beornings, e
isso é um grande elogio, pois os Beornings são os melhores padeiros que eu
conheço; mas hoje em dia não estão muito dispostos a distribuir seus pães entre os
viajantes. Vocês é que são anfitriões muito gentis.
- Mesmo assim, é melhor que economizem a comida - disseram eles.

- Comam um pouco de cada vez, e só quando necessário. Pois estamos lhes dando essas
coisas para que sejam de serventia quando tudo mais faltar. Os bolos se mantêm
frescos por muitos dias, se não se quebrarem e forem mantidos em sua embalagem de folhas,
como os trouxemos. Apenas um pode manter um viajante em pé durante um longo
dia de trabalho, mesmo que esse viajante seja um dos altos homens de Minas Tirith.
Depois os elfos desembrulharam e deram a eles as roupas que tinham trazido. Para cada um
trouxeram um capuz e uma capa, feitos de acordo com seu tamanho, e do tecido
sedoso produzido pelos Galadhrim, que era leve, e nem por isso deixava de ser quente. Era
dificil precisar suas cores: pareciam ser cinzentos com a nuance do crepúsculo
sob as árvores; apesar disso, quando movimentados ou colocados sob outra luz, eram verdes
como a água sob as estrelas, ou castanhos como campos fulvos à noite, e
de um prataescuro sob a luz das estrelas. Cada capa era presa ao pescoço por um broche
semelhante a uma folha verde raiada de prata.
- São capas mágicas? - perguntou Pippin, olhando-as admirado.
- Não sei o que quer dizer - respondeu o líder dos elfos. - São trajes bonitos, e o fio é
de boa qualidade, pois foi feito nesta terra. São vestimentas élficas,
com certeza, se é isso que quer dizer. Folha e ramo, água e rocha: elas têm a beleza de
todos esses elementos sob nosso amado crepúsculo de Lórien, pois colocamos
o pensamento de tudo o que amamos nas coisas que fazemos. Mas são vestes, não armaduras,
e não repelirão lanças ou lâminas. Mas vão servi-los bem: são leves de usar,
quentes o suficiente e frescas o suficiente, conforme a necessidade. E vão encontrar
nelas uma grande ajuda quando precisarem se esconder dos olhos inimigos, se
andarem entre as rochas ou entre as árvores. Realmente, a Senhora os tem em alta conta!
Pois ela mesma, com suas aias, teceu esse material, e nunca antes tínhamos
vestido forasteiros com as roupas de nosso próprio povo!
Depois da refeição matinal, a Comitiva disse adeus ao gramado perto da fonte. Tinham um
peso nos corações, pois o lugar era lindo e tinha se tornado para eles como
sua propria casa, embora não fossem capazes de contar os dias e noites que passaram ali.
Enquanto pararam um pouco para olhar
#395
a água cristalina sob a luz do sol, Haldir veio andando na direção deles, atravessando a
relva verde da clareira. Frodo o cumprimentou com alegria.
- Estou voltando das Fronteiras do Norte - disse o elfo - e estou sendo enviado para ser
o guia da Comitiva novamente. O Vale do Riacho Escuro está cheio de vapor
e nuvens de fumaça, e as montanhas estão inquietas. Há rumores nas profundezas da terra.
Se algum de vocês tivesse pensado em voltar para casa pelo Norte, não conseguiria
passar por ali. Mas venham! Seu caminho agora é pelo Sul.
Conforme passaram através de Caras Galadhon, viram que os caminhos verdes estavam vazios;
mas no alto das árvores muitas vozes murmuravam e cantavam. Eles por sua
vez estavam em silêncio. Finalmente Haldir os conduziu, descendo as encostas ao Sul da
colina, e chegaram outra vez ao grande portão cheio de lamparinas, e a ponte
branca; assim foram passando e deixando para trás a cidade dos elfos. Então saíram da
estrada pavimentada e tomaram uma trilha que entrava num denso maciço de pés
de mallorn e seguia em frente, descrevendo curvas através de florestas sinuosas cobertas
de sombra prateada, sempre conduzindo-os para baixo, para o Sul e para o
Leste, em direção às margens do Rio.
Tinham avançado cerca de dez milhas, e o meio-dia já chegava, quando atingiram uma
muralha alta e verde. Passando por uma abertura, de repente saíram da região arborizada.
Adiante se deitava um longo gramado verde, salpicado de douradas flores de elanor que
reluziam ao sol. O gramado se estendia numa língua estreita entre duas margens:
à direita e ao Oeste, o Veio de Prata corria brilhando; à esquerda e ao Leste, o Grande
Rio rolava suas águas caudalosas, profundas e escuras. Nas margens mais adiante,
a floresta ainda prosseguia na direção Sul, até onde a vista podia alcançar, mas toda a
região das margens estava vazia e desolada. Nenhum mallorn erguia seus ramos
dourados além da Terra de Lórien.

Na margem do Veio de Prata, a alguma distância acima do encontro das correntezas, via-se
um ancoradouro de pedras e madeiras brancas. Ali estavam ancorados muitos
barcos e barcaças. Alguns estavam pintados com cores claras, e brilhavam como prata, ouro
ou verde, mas a maioria deles eram brancos ou cinzentos. Três pequenos
barcos cinzentos tinham sido preparados para os viajantes, e nestes os elfos colocaram
seus mantimentos. Acrescentaram também rolos de corda, três para cada barco.
Pareciam finas, mas fortes, sedosas ao contato, de uma tonalidade cinzenta semelhante à
dos trajes élficos.
- Que são estas coisas? - perguntou Sam, pegando uma corda que estava sobre o gramado.
- Cordas mesmo! - respondeu um elfo que estava nos barcos. - Nunca faça uma longa viagem
sem uma corda! E uma corda que seja comprida,
#396
forte e leve. Estas são assim. Elas podem ser úteis em muitas ocasiões de necessidade.
- Não precisa me dizer isso! - disse Sam. - Vim sem nenhuma corda, e tenho me preocupado
desde então. Mas estava perguntando do que estas são feitas, pois sei um
pouco sobre a fabricação de cordas: é coisa de família, como se pode dizer.
- São feitas de hithlain - disse o elfo -, mas não há tempo agora para
instruí-lo na arte de sua fabricação. Se tivéssemos sabido que o oficio lhe agradava,
poderíamos
ter-lhe ensinado muito. Mas agora, infelizmente, a não ser que você volte aqui alguma
vez, deve ficar satisfeito com nosso presente. Que seja de serventia!
- Venham! - disse Haldir. - Está tudo pronto agora para vocês. Entrem nos barcos! Mas
tomem cuidado no início!
- Prestem atenção a essas palavras - disseram os elfos. - Esses barcos são de construção
leve, e são espertos e diferentes dos barcos de outros povos. Não afundarão,
não importa quanto os carregarem, mas são teimosos se forem mal conduzidos. Seria bom que
se acostumassem a embarcar e desembarcar, aqui onde existe um ancoradouro,
antes de partirem correnteza abaixo.
A Comitiva se dividiu da seguinte forma: Aragorn, Frodo e Sam num barco; Boromir, Merry e
Pippin em outro, e no terceiro foram Legolas e Gimli, que tinham agora
se tornado grandes amigos. Neste último colocaram a maioria dos mantimentos e das
mochilas. Os barcos eram movimentados e dirigidos com remos curtos, que tinham
lâminas largas em forma de folha. Quando tudo estava pronto, Aragorn os conduziu num
teste, subindo o Veio de Prata. A correnteza era forte e eles avançavam devagar.
Sam ia sentado na proa, agarrado às bordas e olhando ansioso para a margem que se
distanciava. A luz do sol, brilhando na água, ofuscava seus olhos. Quando passavam
além do campo verde da Língua, as árvores se aproximavam da beira do rio. Aqui e ali,
folhas douradas voavam e flutuavam na correnteza ondulada. O ar estava muito
claro e calmo. e tudo estava quieto, a não ser pelo canto alto e distante das cotovias.
Contornaram uma curva fechada do rio, e ali, nadando imponente e descendo a correnteza na
direção deles, viram um enorme cisne. A água formava ondas dos dois lados
de seu peito branco, abaixo do pescoço curvado. O bico brilhava como ouro polido e os
olhos faiscavam como azeviche engastado em rochas amarelas; as enormes asas
brancas estavam meio levantadas. Uma música descia o rio conforme o cisne se aproximava,
e de repente perceberam que era um navio, construido e entalhado com o talento
dos elfos, na forma de uma ave. Dois elfos vestidos de branco o conduziam
#397
com remos negros. Bem ao centro do navio se sentava Celeborn, e atrás dele vinha em pé
Galadriel, alta e branca; uma coroa de flores douradas enfeitava-lhe
os cabelos e, segurando uma harpa nas mãos, ela cantava. Triste e cristalino era o som de
sua voz no ar claro e
fresco.
Cantei as folhas, de ourofilhas, e,folhas vi brotar
Cantei o vento e vento veio os galhos farfalhar.

Além do Sol, da Lua além, no Mar espuma havia, Em Ilmarin
dourando a praia uma Arvore crescia.
Em Eldamar na Semprenoite com astros se ostentava.
Onde Eldamar da bela Tirion os muros encontrava.
Cresceram lá as douradas folhas nos ramos anuais,
Enquanto o pranto de elfos cai aquém de nossos
cais.
ó Lórien! Já vem o inverno, o Dia sem flor nem vida;
As folhas na água vão caindo do Rio em despedida.
ó Lórien! Já por demais do Mar estive deste Lado,
Entrelacei em coroa murcha o elanor dourado.
Se barcos eu cantasse agora, que barco iria voltar,
Que barco me conduziria por tão vasto
Mar?
Aragorn parou seu barco, enquanto o Navio-cisne se aproximava. A Senhora terminou a
canção e os saudou. - Viemos para dar-lhes nosso último adeus - disse ela e para favorecê-los com as bênçãos de nossa terra.
- Embora tenham sido nossos hóspedes - disse Celeborn -, vocês ainda não comeram conosco,
e portanto convidamos a todos para um banquete de despedida, aqui, entre
as águas correntes que os levarão para longe de Lórien.
O Cisne avançou lentamente até o ancoradouro, e eles viraram seus barcos para segui-lo.
Ali,
na extremidade de Egladil, sobre a relva verde, o banquete de despedida
aconteceu; mas Frodo comeu e bebeu pouco, concentrando toda a atenção apenas na beleza da
Senhora e de sua voz. Agora ela não parecia mais perigosa ou terrível,
nem cheia de poderes ocultos. Já tomava, aos olhos dele, a aparência que os
elfos nos últimos tempos algumas vezes têm para os homens: presente, e ao mesmo tempo
remota, uma visão vivente daquilo que já foi deixado há muito para trás pelas velozes
Correntezas do Tempo.
Depois que todos tinham comido e bebido, Celeborn, sentado na relva, falou-lhes de novo
sobre a viagem, e, levantando a mão, apontou para o Sul, Para as florestas
além da Língua.
#398
- À medida que seguirem descendo o rio - disse ele -, perceberão que as árvores vão
desaparecer, e que estarão entrando numa região desolada. Ali o Rio corre num
vale rochoso por entre altas charnecas, até que finalmente, depois de muitas milhas,
chega à alta ilha de Rocha do Espigão, que nós chamamos de Tol Brandir. Ali
ele estende seus braços ao redor das encostas íngremes da ilha, caindo então com grande
estrondo e fumaça nas cataratas de Rauros, no Nindalf, o Campo Alagado, como
se diz na língua de vocês. Aquela é uma região de pântanos morosos, onde o rio se torna
tortuoso e muito dividido. Ali, por meio de várias desembocaduras, recebe
as águas do Entágua, que vem da Floresta de Fangorn no Oeste. Às margens do Entágua,
deste lado do Grande Rio, fica Rohan. Do outro lado ficam as colinas desoladas
de Emyn Muil. Naquele ponto o vento sopra do Leste, pois as colinas se debruçam sobre os
Pântanos Mortos e as Terras-deNinguém, em direçào a Cirith Gorgor e aos
portões negros de Mordor.
- Borornir e quem quer que o acompanhe à procura de Minas Tirith farão bem em deixar o
Grande Rio acima de Rauros e cruzar o Entágua, antes que ele atinja os pântanos.
Apesar disso, não devem subir muito aquele rio, nem se arriscar a ficar presos na
Floresta de Fangorn. Aquela é uma terra estranha, e pouco conhecida. Mas não há
dúvida de que Boromir e Aragorn não precisam desta advertência.
- Realmente ouvimos falar de Fangorn em Minas Tirith - disse Boromir. - Mas o que ouvi me
parece ser, quase tudo, contos de velhas avós, como aqueles que contamos
a nossas crianças. Tudo o que fica ao Norte de Rohan está agora para nós tão distante que
a imaginação pode voar livremente. Há muito tempo, Fangorn fazia divisa

com nosso reino, mas há muitas gerações de homens nenhum de nós visita aquela região,
para poder provar se são verdadeiras ou falsas as lendas que chegaram até nós,
vindas de anos longínquos.
- Eu próprio já estive algumas vezes em Rohan, mas nunca atravessei a floresta em direção
ao Norte. Quando fui enviado como mensageiro, passei pelo Desfiladeiro
num ponto próximo às Montanhas Brancas, e atravessei o Isen e o rio Cinzento chegando à
Terra do Norte. Uma viagem longa e cansativa. Calculo que tenha viajado quatrocentas
léguas, e isso levou muitos meses, pois perdi meu cavalo em Tharbad, no vau do rio
Cinzento. Depois daquela viagem, e da estrada que trilhei com esta Comitiva, não
duvido muito que consiga encontrar um caminho através de Rohan, e de Fangorn também, se
houver necessidade.
- Então não preciso dizer mais nada - disse Celeborn. - Mas não despreze a tradição que
vem de anos longínquos; talvez as velhas avós guardem na memória relatos
sobre coisas que alguma vez foram úteis para o conhecimento dos sábios.
#399
Nesse momento, Galadriel se levantou do gramado, e tomando uma taça da mão de uma de suas
aias, encheu-a com hidromel branco e ofereceu-a a Celeborn.
- Agora é o momento de fazermos nosso brinde de despedida - disse ela. - Beba, Senhor dos
Galadhrim! E não vamos permitir que nossos corações se entristeçam, embora
a noite possa estar se aproximando e o crepúsculo já esteja chegando.
Então ofereceu uma taça a cada um da Comitiva, e propôs um brinde de boa viagem. Mas
quando beberam, ordenou que se sentassem de novo na relva, e cadeiras foram
colocadas para ela e para Celeborn. As aias pararam em silêncio ao seu lado, e por uns
instantes ela olhou para os convidados. Finalmente, falou de novo.
- Bebemos uma taça de despedida - disse ela -, e as sombras se adensam entre nós. Mas
antes que partam, trouxe em meu navio presentes que o Senhor e a Senhora
dos
Galadhrim agora oferecem a vocês em memória de Lothlórien. - Então chamou-os um por um.
- Aqui está o presente de Celeborn e Galadriel para o líder da Comitiva - disse ela a
Aragorn, dando-lhe uma bainha feita sob medida para sua espada. Era coberta
por uma gravura de flores e folhas feita em ouro e prata e que trazia inscrito, em runas
élficas formadas por muitas pedras, o nome de Andúril e a linhagem da espada.
- A lâmina que for retirada desta bainha não será manchada ou quebrada, mesmo na derrota
- disse ela. - Mas há alguma outra coisa que deseja de mim em nossa despedida?
Pois a escuridão ira nos separar, e pode ser que não nos encontremos de novo, a não ser
longe daqui, numa estrada que não tem retorno.
E Aragorn respondeu: - Senhora, conhece todos os meus desejos, e há muito tempo guarda o
único tesouro que procuro. Mas ele não lhe pertence, e não poderia oferecê-lo
a mim, mesmo que estivesse disposta; apenas atravessando a escuridão é que poderei chegar
até ele.
- Mesmo assim, talvez isto possa aliviar seu coração - disse Galadriel pois foi deixado
aos meus cuidados para que entregasse a você, caso passasse por esta terra.
- Então ela ergueu de seu colo uma grande pedra verdeclara, engastada num broche de
prata, moldado na forma de uma aguia com as asas abertas; ao erguê-lo, a pedra
brilhou como o sol através das folhas na primavera. - Esta pedra dei a Celebrían, minha
filha, e ela a sua própria filha; e agora ela chega até você como um símbolo
de esperança. Assuma neste momento o nome que foi predito para você, Elessar, Pedra
Élfica da casa de Elendil!
Então Aragorn pegou a pedra e fixou o broche sobre o peito, e aqueles que olhavam para
ele ficaram admirados, pois não tinham ainda notado
#400
sua altura e sua postura de rei, e tiveram a impressão de que muitos anos de luta caíram
de seus ombros. - Agradeço-lhe pelos presentes que me deu - disse ele ó Senhora de Lórien, de quem nasceram Celebrían e Arwen, Estrela da Tarde. Que maior
elogio poderia eu fazer?

A Senhora curvou a cabeça, e então voltou-se para Boromir, oferecendo-lhe
um cinto de ouro; a Merry e Pippin ofertou pequenos cintos de prata, cada um com uma
fivela
moldada na forma de uma flor de ouro. A Legolas ofereceu um arco semelhante aos usados
pelos Galadhrim, mais comprido e robusto que os arcos da Floresta das Trevas,
e cuja corda era feita de fios de cabelo élfico. Vinha acompanhado de um feixe de
flechas.
- Para você, pequeno jardineiro e amante das árvores - disse ela a Sam -. tenho apenas um
pequeno presente. - Colocou na mão dele uma pequena caixa de madeira cinza,
sem adornos, a não ser por uma única runa de prata sobre a tampa. - Aqui está escrito um
G de Galadriel - disse ela.
Mas também pode significar "gramado" na sua língua. Esta caixa contém terra de meu pomar,
e nela está a bênção que Galadriel ainda pode conceder. A terra não impedirá
que você se desvie do caminho, nem irá defendêlo de qualquer perigo; mas se a guardar e
finalmente voltar a ver sua terra, então talvez possa reconipensá-lo. Embora
possa encontrar tudo deserto e abandonado, haverá poucos jardins na Terra-média que
florescerão como o seu, se espalhar esta terra lá. Então poderá se lembrar de
Galadriel, e ter uma vista distante de Lórien, que você viu apenas em nosso inverno.
Porque nossa primavera e nosso verão já passaram, e nunca mais serão vistos
de novo na terra, a não ser em lembranças.
Sam corou até as orelhas e murmurou qualquer coisa inaudível, enquanto agarrava a caixa e
tentava fazer uma reverência.
- E que presente um anão pediria aos elfos? - perguntou Galadriel, voltando-se para
Gimli.
- Nenhum, Senhora - respondeu Gimli. - A mim basta ter visto a Senhora dos Galadhrim, e
ter ouvido suas gentis palavras.
- Escutem vocês todos, elfos
exclamou ela para aqueles à sua volta.
- Não deixem ninguém dizer que os anões são ávidos e indelicados! Mesmo assim, com
certeza Gimli, filho de Glóin, você deseja algo que eu possa ofertar. Revele
seu desejo, eu lhe peço! Você não deve ser o único convidado a ficar sem um presente.
- Não quero nada, Senhora Galadriel - disse Gimli, fazendo uma grande reverência e
gaguejando. - Nada, a não ser que talvez... a não ser que seja permitido pedir,
não, desejar um único fio de seu cabelo, que ultrapassa o ouro da terra como as estrelas
ultrapassam as gemas da mina. Não peço tal presente, mas a Senhora me
ordenou que revelasse meu desejo.
#401
os elfos se agitaram e murmuraram atônitos, e Celeborn observou o anão admirado, mas a
Senhora sorriu. - Diz-se que o talento dos anões está em suas mãos e não em
suas línguas - disse ela. - Mas não se pode dizer o mesmo de Gimli. Pois ninguém jamais
me fez um pedido tão ousado, e ao tuesmo tempo tão cortês. E como posso
negá-lo, já que fui eu quem ordenou que ele falasse? Mas, diga-me, o que você faria com
um presente desses?
- Guardá-lo-ia como uma relíquia, Senhora - respondeu ele -, em memória das palavras que
me disse em nosso primeiro encontro. E se eu algum dia retornar às forjas
de minha terra, será colocado num cristal indestrutível, para ser a herança de minha casa
e um testemunho de boa vontade entre a Montanha e a Floresta até o fim
dos dias.
Então a Senhora desfez uma de suas longas tranças e cortou três fios dourados, colocandoos na mão de Gimli. - Estas palavras acompanharão o presente - disse ela.
- Não vou predizer, pois todas as predições são vãs nestes tempos: de um lado está a
escuridão, e do outro só há esperança. Mas se a esperança não falhar, então
digo a você, Gimli, filho de Glóin, que suas mãos vão se encher de ouro e, apesar disso,
o ouro não vai dominá-lo.
- E você, Portador do Anel - disse ela voltando-se para Frodo. - Dirijo-me a voce por
último, embora não seja o último em meus pensamentos. Para você, preparei

isto. - Ergueu um pequeno frasco de cristal: brilhava quando ela o virava em sua mão, e
raios de luz branca emanavam dele. - Este frasco - disse ela - contém a
luz da estrela de Eärendil engastada nas águas de minha fonte. Brilhará ainda mais
quando a noite cair
ao seu redor. Que essa luz ilumine os lugares escuros por onde passar, quando todas as
outras luzes se apagarem. Lembre-se de Galadriel e de seu Espelho!
Frodo pegou o frasco, e por um momento, enquanto ele brilhava entre eles, viu a Senhora
novamente como uma rainha, grandiosa e bela, mas não terrível. Fez uma reverência
e não soube o que dizer.
Depois a Senhora se levantou, e Celeborn os conduziu de volta ao ancoradouro. Uma tarde
dourada se deitava sobre a terra verde da Língua, e a água brilhava em tons
de prata. Finalmente tudo ficou pronto. Os membros da Comitiva tomaram seus lugares nos
barcos como antes. Gritando adeus, os elfos de Lórien, com grandes varas
cinzentas, os empurraram para a correnteza, e as águas ondulantes os levaram lentamente
para longe. Os viajantes estavam quietos, sem se mover ou conversar. Na margem
verde próxima à Língua, a Senhora Galadriel parou sozinha e em silêncio. Quando passaram
por ela, todos se voltaram, e seus olhos observaram-na lentamente flutuando
para longe deles. Pois foi essa a impressão que tiveram: Lórien estava se distanciando,
como um navio claro cujos mastros eram árvores
#402
encantadas, navegando para praias esquecidas, enquanto eles sentavam-se desamparados na
margem do mundo cinzento e sem folhas.
Enquanto olhavam, o Veio de Prata passou, entrando nas correntezas do Grande Rio, e os
barcos viraram e começaram a tomar velocidade em direção ao Sul. Logo a forma
branca da Senhora era pequena e distante. Ela brilhava como uma janela de vidro sobre uma
colina ao longe no sol poente, ou como um lago remoto visto de uma montanha:
um cristal caído no colo da terra. Então Frodo teve a impressão de que ela levantara o
braço num último aceno, e distante, mas perfeitamente claro, vinha com o vento
o som de sua voz cantando. Mas agora ela cantava na língua antiga dos elfos de além-Mar,
e ele não conseguia entender as palavras: bela era a música, mas não podia
consolá-lo.
Apesar disso, como acontece com as palavras élficas, estas ficaram gravadas em sua
memória, e muito tempo depois ele as interpretou o melhor que pôde: a língua era
a das músicas élficas, e falava de coisas pouco conhecidas na Terra-média.

há de encher-me a taça outra vez? Pois agora a Inflamadora, Varda, a Rainha das Estrelas,
do Monte Semprebranco ergueu suas mãos como nuvens, e todos os caminhos
mergulharam fundo nas trevas; e de uma terra cinzenta a escuridão se deita sobre as ondas
espumantes entre nós, e a névoa cobre as jóias de Calacirya para sempre.
Agora perdida, perdida para aqueles do Leste está Valimar! Adeus! Talvez hajas de
encontrar Valimar. Talvez tu mesmo hajas de encontrá-la. Adeus! "
Varda é o nome da Senhora que os elfos nestas terras de exílio chamaria de Elbereth.
De repente o rio fez uma curva, e as margens se ergueram dos dois lados, e a luz de
Lórien se escondeu. Àquela bela terra Frodo nunca mais voltou. Os viajantes
agora voltaram sua atenção para a viagem; o sol estava à
sua frente e ofuscava seus olhos todos cheios de lágrimas. Gmli chorou abertamente.
- Olhei pela última vez para aquela que era a mais bela - disse ele a Legolas, seu
companheiro. - Daqui para frente, não chamarei nada de belo, a não ser o presente
que ela me deu. - Colocou a mão no peito.
- Diga-me, Legolas, por que vim nesta Demanda" Mal sabia onde o maior perigo estava.
Elrond estava certo quando disse que não podíamos prever o que poderíamos encontrar
em nosso caminho. O tormento no escuro era o perigo que eu temia, e esse perigo não me
demoveu. Mas eu não teria vindo, se soubesse do perigo da luz e da alegria.
Agora, com esta despedida, sofri meu maior ferimento, e não poderia haver pior nem mesmo
que eu tivesse de ir nesta noite, diretamente ao encontro do Senhor do Escuro.
Pobre Gimli, filho de Glóin!
- Não - disse Legolas. - Pobres todos nós! E todos os que caminham pelo mundo nestes
últimos tempos. Pois assim são os modos deste mundo: encontrar e perder, como
parece àqueles cujo barco está na correnteza veloz. Mas considero você um abençoado,
Gimli, filho de Glóin: pois sua perda você sofre de livre e espontânea vontade,
e poderia ter escolhido outro caminho. Mas não abandonou seus companheiros, e a menor
recompensa que poderá ter é que a memória de Lothlórien permanecera sempre
viva e imaculada em seu coração, e não vai se apagar nem envelhecer.
- Talvez - disse Gimli. - E agradeço por suas palavras. Palavras verdadeiras, sem dúvida;
apesar disso, todo esse consolo é frio. A lembrança não é o que deseja
o coração. É apenas um espelho, mesmo que seja cristalino como Kheled-zâram. Pelo menos,
é isso que sente o coração de Gimli, o anão. Os elfos podem enxergar
as coisas de outra forma. Na verdade, ouvi dizer que para eles a memoria e mais
semelhante à realidade do que ao sonho. Não é assim para os anoes.
- Mas deixemos de falar disso. Olhe para o barco! Está muito afundado na água com toda
esta bagagem, e o Grande Rio é veloz. Não quero afogar
#404
minha tristeza em água fria. - Pegou um remo, e dirigiu o barco para a margem Oeste,
seguindo o de Aragorn que ia à frente, e que já tinha saído do meio da correnteza.
Assim continuou a Comitiva em seu longo caminho, descendo as águas velozes e caudalosas,
sempre levados para o Sul. Florestas,nuas se erguiam nas duas margens, e
eles não conseguiam ver qualquer sinal das terras que ficavam para trás. A brisa se
aquietou e o Rio corria sem qualquer ruído. Nenhuma voz de pássaro quebrava o
silêncio. O sol se cobria de névoa à medida que o dia ficava velho, até brilhar no céu
claro como uma pérola branca e nobre. Depois se apagou no Oeste, e o crepúsculo
chegou cedo, seguido por uma noite cinzenta e sem estrelas. Para dentro das horas escuras
e silenciosas eles continuaram navegando, guiando seus barcos pelas sombras
das florestas do Oeste. Grandes árvores passavam como fantasmas, lançando suas raizes
retorcidas e famintas através da névoa para dentro da água. A região era desolada
e fria. Frodo ouvia o som apagado e borbulhante do Rio que ondulava por entre as raizes
das árvores e os troncos soltos perto da margem, até que sua cabeça pendeu

e ele caiu num sono agitado.

#405
CAPíTULO IX
O GRANDE RIO

Frodo foi acordado por Sam. Descobriu que estava deitado, bem agasalhado, sob altas
árvores de casca cinzenta num canto silencioso da floresta, na margem Oeste do
Grande Rio Anduin. Tinha dormido toda a noite e a manhã cinzenta estava escura por entre
os galhos nus. Gimli se ocupava em fazer uma fogueira ali perto.
Partiram de novo antes que o dia se abrisse. Não que a maioria dos membros da Comitiva
estivesse ansiosa por correr em direção ao Sul: estavam satisfeitos porque
a decisão, que deveria ser tomada o mais tardar quando chegassem a Rauros e à Ilha Rocha
do Espigão, pôde ser postergada por alguns dias, e deixavam que o Rio os
conduzisse em seu próprio passo, pois não queriam correr em direção aos perigos que os
esperavam, qualquer que fosse o caminho que decidissem tomar no final. Aragom
permitiu que acompanhassem a correnteza como desejavam, poupando as forças para o cansaço
que viria. Mas insistiu que pelo menos partissem cedo a cada dia, e que
viajassem até o anoitecer, pois sentia em seu coração que o tempo urgia e temia que o
Senhor do Escuro não tivesse ficado parado enquanto a Comitiva havia permanecido
em Lórien.
Apesar disso, não se viu qualquer sinal de inimigos naquele dia, nem no dia seguinte. As
horas enfadonhas e cinzentas se arrastavam sem qualquer surpresa. Quando
o terceiro dia de jornada terminava, a região começou lentamente a mudar: as árvores
rarearam e desapareceram por completo. Na margem Leste à esquerda deles, viram
encostas compridas e informes erguendo-se em direção ao céu; tinham uma aparência escura
e seca, como se o fogo as tivesse varrido, não deixando qualquer folha verde:
um deserto hostil sem nem uma árvore quebrada ou rocha escarpada que aliviasse o vazio.
Naquele dia tinham atingido as Terras Castanhas que ficavam, vastas e desoladas,
entre o Sul da Floresta das Trevas e as colinas de Emym Muil . Nem mesmo Aragorn sabia
dizer que pestilência ou guerra, ou que feito maléfico do Inimigo tinha desolado
toda a região daquela maneira.
Do lado Oeste, à direita deles, a região também não tinha árvores, mas era plana, e em
vários pontos coberta com amplos trechos de capim verde. Desse lado do Rio,
viram passar florestas de grandes juncos, tão altos que os impediam de enxergar a Oeste,
enquanto os pequenos barcos passavam roçando suas bordas trêmulas. As plumas
escuras e ressecadas pendiam e se lançavam no vento frio e leve, sussurrando suave e
tristemente. Aqui e ali

Frodo conseguia ver de relance, através de aberturas por entre os juncos, extensos prados
e, mais além, colinas ao pôr-do-sol, e mais longe ainda, no horizonte,
uma linha escura, na qual desfilavam as cordilheiras do extremo Sul das Montanhas
Sombrias.
Não se via sinal de seres vivos em movimento, a não ser pássaros. Destes havia muitos:
pequenas aves assobiando e piando nos juncos, mas que dificilmente eram vistas.
Uma vez ou outra os viajantes, ouviam o agito alvoroçado de asas de cisnes, e olhando
para cima viram um grande bando deles cruzando o céu.
- Cisnes! - disse Sam. - E dos grandes!
- Sim - disse Aragorn -, e são cisnes negros.
- Como toda esta região parece vazia, ampla
e melancólica! - disse Frodo. - Sempre
imaginei que, conforme se viajasse para o Sul, tudo ficasse mais quente e

alegre, até que o inverno fosse deixado para trás eternamente.
- Mas ainda não viajamos tanto para o Sul - disse Aragorn. - Ainda é inverno, e estamos
longe do mar. Aqui o mundo é frio até que chegue de repente a primavera,
e ainda podemos encontrar neve outra vez. Lá adiante, descendo até a Baía de Belfalas
,
para a qual o Andum corre, o clima é quente e alegre, talvez; ou seria,
se
não fosse pelo Inimigo. Mas aqui não estamos mais de sessenta léguas, eu acho, ao Sul da
Quarta Sul lá do seu Condado, a centenas de longas milhas deste ponto. Agora
estão olhando para o Sudoeste, através das planícies do Norte da Terra dos Cavaleiros,
Rohan, onde moram os Senhores dos Cavalos. Em breve chegaremos à foz do Limclaro,
que vem de Fangorn para se encontrar com o Grande Rio. Aquela é a fronteira Norte de
Rohan, e antigamente toda a região que ficava entre o Lieclaro e as Montanhas
Brancas pertencia aos Rohirrim. A região é rica e agradável, e sua relva não tem rival;
mas nestes dias maléficos as pessoas não moram perto do Rio, nem cavalgam
com freqüência até suas margens. O Andum é largo, mas mesmo assim os
orcs conseguem atirar suas flechas muito além da margem oposta; ultimamente, pelo que se
diz,
eles têm ousado atravessar o rio e atacar os rebanhos e a criação de cavalos de Rohan.
Sam olhava inquieto de uma margem para outra. Antes, as árvores lhe pareceram hostis,
como se escondessem olhos secretos e perigos à espreita; agora ele desejava
que as árvores ainda estivessem lá. Sentia que a Comitiva estava desprotegida demais,
flutuando em pequenos barcos abertos, em meio a uma região descoberta, num
rio que era a fronteira da guerra.
Nos dois dias seguintes, enquanto avançavam, sempre para o Sul, essa sensação de
insegurança cresceu em toda a Comitiva. Durante um dia inteiro, eles pegaram seus
remos e avançaram depressa. As margens passavam deslizando. Logo o Rio se alargou e ficou
mais raso; praias compridas e pedregosas se deitavam ao Leste, e havia
bancos de areia e cascalho na água,
#407
de modo que era preciso conduzir os barcos com cuidado. As Terras Castanhas surgiam em
descampados desertos, sobre os quais soprava um ar frio do Leste. Do outro
lado, os prados tinham-se transformado em ladeiras de grama ressequida em meio a uma
região de brejos e moitas de capim. Frodo teve um calafrio ao pensar nos gramados
e fontes, no sol claro e nas suaves chuvas de Lórien. Pouco se falava e ninguém ria nos
barcos. Cada
membro da Comitiva estava ocupado com seus próprios pensamentos.
O coração de Legolas corria sob as estrelas de uma noite de verão em alguma clareira do
Norte, em meio a florestas de faias; Gimli, em sua mente, manuseava ouro,
e se perguntava se ele serviria para forjar um estojo para o presente da Senhora. Merry e
Pippin, no barco do meio, estavam agitados, pois Boromir resmungava consigo
mesmo, algumas vezes mordendo as unhas como se alguma inquietação ou dúvida o consumisse,
outras vezes agarrando um remo e aproximando seu barco do de Aragorn. Então
Pippin, que estava sentado à proa e olhando para trás, captou um brilho estranho nos
olhos do homem, no momento em que ele olhava fixamente para Frodo. Sam já tinha
decidido havia muito tempo que, embora os barcos talvez não fôssem tão perigosos como o
tinham feito acreditar, eram muito mais desconfortáveis do que haviajamais
imaginado. Sentia-se preso e deprimido, não tendo mais nada a fazer a não ser olhar para
aquelas terras invernais se arrastando, e para a água cinzenta de seus dois
lados. Mesmo quando usavam os remos, nenhum era confiado a Sam.
Enquanto descia o crepúsculo no quarto dia, ele olhava para trás, por cima das cabeças
abaixadas de Frodo e Aragorn e dos barcos que vinham
atrás: estava sonolento
e queria acampar e sentir a terra sob os pés. De repente, alguma coisa chamou sua
atenção: primeiro olhou para ela com indiferença, depois aprumou-se no barco e
esfregou os olhos; mas quando olhou outra vez não conseguiu ver mais nada.

Naquela noite, acamparam numa ilhota próxima à margem Oeste. Sam estava deitado, enrolado
em cobertores, ao lado de Frodo. - Tive um sonho engraçado uma ou duas
horas antes de pararmos, Sr. Frodo - disse ele. Ou talvez não fosse um sonho. Mas foi
engraçado, de qualquer maneira.
- Bem, o que era"? - disse Frodo, sabendo que Sam não sossegaria até que contasse sua
história, fosse ela qual fosse. - Não vi ou pensei em nada que me fizesse sorrir
desde que partimos de Lórien.
- Não era engraçado dessa maneira, Sr. Frodo. Foi estranho. Tudo errado, se não foi
sonho. E é melhor que o senhor escute: vi um tronco de árvore com olhos.
- Tudo certo com o tronco - disse Frodo. - Há muitos no Rio. Mas deixe os olhos para lá!
#408
- Isso não posso fazer - disse Sam. - Foram os olhos que me fizeram levantar, por assim
dizer. Vi o que julguei ser um tronco boiando à meialuz, atrás do barco de
Gimli, mas não dei muita atenção àquilo. Então me pareceu que o tronco estava lentamente
nos alcançando. E isso foi uma coisa peculiar, como se pode dizer, se
pensarmos que todos nós estávamos boiando na correnteza juntos. Bem nessa hora, eu vi os
olhos: iguais a dois pontos claros, brilhantes, numa corcova perto da ponta
do tronco. Além do mais, não era um tronco, pois tinha pés como remos, quase como os de
um cisne, só que pareciam maiores, e ficavam entrando e saindo da água.
- Foi então que levantei e esfreguei os olhos, com a intenção de dar um grito, se ele
ainda continuasse lá depois que eu tivesse espantado o sono de minha cabeça.
Pois o que-quer-que-fosse estava vindo rápido agora, e se aproximando do barco de Gimli.
Mas não sei se aquelas duas lamparinas viram que eu me mexia, ou se voltei
ao normal. Quando olhei de novo, a
coisa não estava mais lá. Mas eu acho que vi
de relance, com o rabo do olho, como se diz, alguma coisa escura entrando
na sombra da margem. Mas não vi mais olho nenhum.
- Disse para mim mesmo: "sonhando de novo, Sam Gamgi", eu disse; e não disse mais nada
depois disso. Mas não paro de pensar desde que aconteceu, e agora não tenho
tanta certeza, Que acha disso, Sr. Frodo?
- Eu acharia que não foi nada além de um tronco no escuro e sono em seus olhos, Sam disse Frodo -, se esta fosse a primeira vez que aqueles olhos foram vistos.
Mas não é. Eu os vi longe daqui, lá no Norte, antes de chegarmos a Lórien. E vi uma
criatura esquisita com olhos subindo noflet aquela noite. Haldir também viu.
E você se lembra do relato dos elfos que foram atrás do bando de orcs?
- Ah - disse Sam. - Lembro sim, e lembro-me também de outras coisas. Não gosto do que
estou pensando, mas colocando uma coisa junto com a outra, e com as histórias
do Sr. Bilbo e tudo mais, acho que poderia arriscar um nome para a criatura. Um nome
horrível. Gollum, talvez?
- Sim, é isso que venho temendo há algum tempo - disse Frodo. - Desde a noite no flet.
Suponho que já estava à espreita em Moria, onde descobriu nossa trilha; mas
eu tinha esperanças de que nossa estada em Lórien tivesse feito com que ele perdesse
nosso rastro outra vez. A miserável criatura deve ter ficado escondida nas florestas
que margeiam o Veio de Prata, vigiando até que partíssemos.
- É isso mesmo - disse Sam, - E é melhor ficarmos um pouco mais atentos, ou vamos sentir
uns dedos nojentos em volta de nossos pescoços uma noite dessas, se é que
vamos ter tempo de acordar e sentir alguma coisa. E era isso que eu ia começar a fazer.
Não é preciso incomodar Passolargo e os outros esta noite. Vou ficar de guarda.
Posso dormir amanhã, já que não passo de uma bagagem no barco, como se poderia dizer.
#409
- Eu diria - disse Frodo. - E diria "bagagem que enxerga". Você vai ficar de guarda, mas
só se prometer que me acorda no meio da noite, se nada acontecer antes.
Nas últimas horas da noite, Frodo acordou de um sono profundo e sombrio e percebeu que
Sam o sacudia. - É uma pena acordá-lo - sussurrou Sam -, mas o senhor me disse

para fazer isso. Não há nada a contar, ou não muito. Tive a impressão de ter ouvido uns
barulhos de alguma coisa batendo na água e farejando, há uns instantes; mas
a gente escuta um monte desses sons estranhos nas margens de um rio à noite.
Ele se deitou e Frodo levantou-se embrulhado nos cobertores, lutando para espantar o
sono. Minutos ou horas se passaram lentamente, e nada aconteceu. Frodo estava
quase cedendo à tentação de se deitar outra vez quando uma figura escura, quase
invisível, flutuou para perto de um dos barcos ancorados. Podia-se distinguir vagamente
uma mão comprida e esbranquiçada, no momento em que se erguia e agarrava a amurada; dois
olhos pálidos como lamparinas emanaram um brilho frio no momento em que
espiaram dentro do barco, e então se ergueram e olharam para Frodo na ilhota. Não estavam
a mais de um ou dois metros de distância, e Frodo escutou o chiado suave
de ar sendo inspirado. Levantou-se puxando Ferroada da bainha, e enfrentou os olhos.
Imediatamente, a luz que vinha deles desapareceu. Ouviu um outro chiado e o
som de algo caindo na água, e a coisa escura com formato de tronco se distanciou
correnteza abaixo, entrando na escuridão da noite. Aragorn se mexeu dormindo, virou-se
e se sentou.
- O que foi? - sussurrou ele, levantando-se e vindo até Frodo. - Senti algo enquanto
dormia. Por que pegou sua espada?
- Gollum - respondeu Frodo. - Ou, pelo menos, imagino que seja ele.
- Ah! - disse Aragorn. - Então você sabe de nosso pequeno salteador? Ele nos seguiu em
todo o percurso através de Moria e descendo o Nimrodel. Desde que pegamos
os barcos, ele tem estado em cima de um tronco, remando com suas mãos e pés. Tentei pegálo uma ou duas vezes durante a noite, mas ele é mais astuto que uma raposa,
e escorregadio como um peixe. Tinha esperanças de que a viagem pelo rio o fizesse
desistir, mas ele é um nadador muito esperto.
- Tentaremos ir mais rápido amanhã. Agora deite-se e eu faço a guarda durante o restante
da noite. Gostaria de poder pôr as mãos no maldito. Poderíamos fazer com
que fosse útil. Mas se eu não conseguir, devemos tentar fazer com que se perca. É muito
perigoso. Além da possibilidade de assassinar alguém durante a noite por
sua própria conta, ele pode colocar qualquer inimigo que estiver por perto no nosso
rastro.
#410
A noite se passou, e Gollum não se manifestou outra vez. Depois disso a Comitiva manteve
uma estrita vigilância, mas não viram mais Gollum enquanto durou a viagem.
Se ele ainda os seguia, era muito esperto e ágil. Conforme recomendação de Aragorn, eles
remavam agora por longos períodos, e as margens passavam rapidamente. Mas
viam pouca coisa da região, pois viajavam principalmente à noite e no crepúsculo,
descansando durante o dia, escondendo-se o melhor que podiam naquela região. Assim
o tempo passou sem qualquer acontecimento até o sétimo dia.
O céu ainda estava cinzento e carregado, e um vento soprava do Leste, mas quando a noite
foi chegando, as nuvens ao Oeste se desfizeram e poças de luz pálida, amarelas
e verde-claras, se abriram sob as nuvens cinzentas. Ali se podia ver a casca branca da
lua nova reluzindo nos lagos remotos. Sam olhou para ela e franziu a testa.
No dia seguinte, o terreno dos dois lados começou a mudar rapidamente. As margens
começaram a se erguer ficando pedregosas. Logo eles estavam atravessando uma região
de colinas rochosas, e dos dois lados viam-se encostas íngremes enterradas em matagais
de espinhos e abrunheiros, emaranhados com sarças e trepadeiras. Atrás deles
se erguiam penhascos baixos que se desagregavam e protuberâncias de rocha cinzenta,
cobertos de hera escura; além destes se erguiam, por sua vez, cordilheiras altas
coroadas de pinheiros retorcidos pela ação do vento. Estavam se aproximando das
colinas cinzentas de Eniyn Muil, a fronteira Sul das Terras Ermas.
Havia muitos pássaros em volta dos penhascos e das pontas rochosas, e durante todo o dia
bandos de pássaros formaram círculos no ar, negros contra o céu claro. Enquanto
descansavam no acampamento naquele dia, Aragorn observava os vôos cheio de dúvidas,
imaginando se Gollum não estivera fazendo alguma maldade, e se a notícia da viagem

deles não estava agora se prepagando no ermo. Mais tarde, quando o sol se punha e a
Comitiva se movimentava, fazendo os preparativos para uma nova partida, ele distinguiu
um ponto preto contra a luz que se apagava: um grande pássaro voando alto e distante. às
vezes desenhando círculos no céu, outras voando lentamente para o Sul.
- O que é aquilo, Legolas? - perguntou ele, apontando para o céu ao Norte. - Seria, como
imagino,
uma águia"?
Sim - disse Legolas. - É uma águia, uma águia caçadora. Perguntome o que isso significa.
Ela está longe das montanhas.
- Não vamos partir até que escureça completamente - disse Aragorn.
Chegou a oitava noite daquela jornada. Era silenciosa e parada: o vento soturno do Leste
tinha parado. A diáfana lua crescente tinha caído cedo no poente, mas o
céu no alto estava claro, e embora longe ao Sul houvesse grandes
#411
cadeias de nuvens que ainda brilhavam pálidas, no Oeste as estrelas cintilavam claras.
- Venham! - disse Aragom. - Vamos arriscar mais uma jornada noturna. Estamos chegando a
um trecho do Rio que não conheço bem, pois nunca viajei pela água nestas
partes antes, não entre este ponto e as corredeiras de Sarn Gebir.
Mas, se meus cálculos estiverem certos, as corredeiras ainda estão muitas milhas
adiante. Mesmo
assim, encontraremos lugares perigosos antes até de chegarmos mlá: rochas e ilhotas de
pedra na correnteza. Devemos manter uma vigilância rigorosa e evitar remar
rapidamente.
Ficou ao encargo de Sam, no barco da frente, a função de vigia. Ele se deitou com a
cabeça para frente, espiando na escuridão. A noite ficou escura, mas as estrelas
acima estavam estranhamente claras, e a superfície do Rio reluzia. Era quase meia-noite,
e eles já estavam navegando havia algum tempo, quase sem usar os remos,
quando de repente Sam soltou um berro. Apenas a alguns metros adiante, formas escuras
assomaram na correnteza e ele escutou a água veloz num turbilhão. Havia uma
corredeira que levava para a esquerda, em direção à margem Leste, onde o canal estava
desobstruído. Enquanto eram arrastados para o lado, os viajantes puderam ver,
agora muito próxima, a espuma clara do Rio batendo contra os rochedos pontudos que saíam
das águas como uma fileira de dentes. Os barcos estavam todos amontoados.
- Ei, Aragorn! - gritou Boromir, quando seu barco bateu no da frente. - Isto é loucura!
Não podemos desafiar as Corredeiras à noite! Mas nenhum barco pode sobreviver
nas Sarn Gebir, seja de noite seja de dia.
- Para trás! Para trás! - gritou Aragorn. - Vire! Vire se conseguir. - Mergulhou o remo
na água, tentando deter o barco e fazê-lo voltar.
- Meus cálculos estavam errados - disse ele a Frodo. - Não sabia que tínhamos chegado tão
longe: o Andum corre mais rápido do que eu pensava. As Sarn Gebir já devem
estar bem próximas.
Com grande esforço, detiveram os barcos e os viraram; mas no início só conseguiram
avançar muito lentamente contra a correnteza, e todo o tempo eram trazidos para
mais e mais perto da margem Leste, que agora assomava escura e agourenta na noite.
- Todos juntos, remem! - gritou Boromir. - Remem! Ou seremos levados para os bancos de
areia. - Enquanto ouvia isso, Frodo sentiu o barco onde estava raspar numa
pedra.
Nesse momento, ouviu-se o zunido de cordas de arcos: muitas flechas assobiaram sobre suas
cabeças, e algumas caíram no meio deles. Uma atingiu Frodo entre os ombros
e ele cambaleou para frente com um grito, deixando cair seu remo: mas a flecha caiu para
trás, repelida pelo seu colete
#412
oculto de malha metálica. Uma outra passou através do capuz de Aragorn, e uma terceira
ficou espetada na borda do segundo barco, perto da mão de Merry. Sam julgava

poder divisar figuras negras correndo de um lado para o outro sobre os longos montes de
pedra que jaziam sobre a praia Leste. Pareciam estar muito perto.
- Yrch! - gritou Legolas, falando em sua própria língua, num lapso.
- Orcs! - gritou Gimli.
- Coisa do Gollum, com certeza - disse Sam a Frodo. - E também escolheram um bom lugar.
O Rio parece decidido a nos levar direto para os braços deles!
Todos se inclinaram para frente, colocando mais força nos remos: até Sam deu uma ajuda. A
cada momento esperavam sentir a mordida das flechas com penas pretas. Muitas
zuniam acima de suas cabeças ou caíam na água ali perto; mas ninguém mais foi atingido.
Estava escuro, mas não escuro demais para os olhos noturnos dos orcs, e sob
o brilho das estrelas a Comitiva provavelmente ofereceria um alvo fácil aos astutos
inimigos, se a cor cinzenta das capas de Lórien e da madeira dos barcos não derrotasse
a malícia dos arqueiros de Mordor.
Continuaram lutando, remada após remada. Na escuridão, era dificil ter certeza de que
estavam realmente se movendo; mas devagar a força da água em rodamoinho foi
amainando, e a sombra da margem se apagou dentro da escuridão. Finalmente, pelo que
podiam julgar, estavam no meio do Rio outra vez, e haviam recuado os barcos afastando-se
bastante das rochas salientes. Então, viraram os barcos para o Oeste e os conduziram com
toda sua força para a margem. Sob a sombra de arbustos curvados sobre a
água, pararam para tomar fôlego.
Legolas soltou seu remo e pegou o arco que havia trazido de Lórien. Então pulou para a
praia e subiu alguns passos na margem. Puxando a corda e encaixando nela uma
flecha, ele se voltou, espiando por sobre o Rio na escuridào. Do outro lado ouviam-se
gritos agudos, mas não se podia ver nada.
Frodo levantou os olhos para o elfo que se erguia imponente acima dele, observando a
noite e procurando um alvo em que pudesse mirar. A cabeça escura estava coroada
pelas estrelas brancas que reluziam contra os lagos escuros do céu. Mas agora,
levantando-se e navegando do Sul, as nuvens avançavam enviando batedores escuros para
os campos estrelados. Um terror repentino dominou toda a Comitiva.
- Elebereth Gilthoml! - suspirou Legolas ao erguer os olhos. No momento em que falava,
uma forma escura, como uma nuvem mas que não era uma nuvem, pois movia-se
muito mais rápido, surgiu do negrume do Sul, correndo em direção à Comitiva, vedando toda
a luz conforme se aproximava. Logo se definiu como uma grande criatura
alada, mais negra que
#413
os abismos da noite. Vozes selvagens se ergueram para saudá-la, do outro lado do Rio.
Frodo sentiu um calafrio repentino percorrendo seu corpo e apertando seu coração;
teve uma sensação gelada e mortal na região do ombro, como a lembrança de um velho
ferimento. Agachou-se como se estivesse tentando se esconder.
De repente, o grande arco de Lórien cantou. A flecha, impulsionada pela corda, zuniu no
ar. Frodo olhou para cima. Quase em cima dele, a forma alada guinou. Ouviu-se
um grasnado alto e rouco, no momento em que a criatura caiu, desaparecendo dentro da
escuridão da praia Leste.
O céu estava limpo outra vez. Na escuridão, podia-se
distinguir um tumulto de muitas vozes distantes, praguejando e lamentando, e então
silêncio. Depois disso nenhuma lança ou grito veio do Leste naquela noite.
Passado algum tempo, Aragorn conduziu os barcos de novo correnteza acima. Foram tateando
o caminho ao longo da margem por uma certa distância, até que encontraram
uma baía pequena e rasa. Algumas árvores baixas cresciam ali, perto da água, e atrás
delas subia uma margem rochosa e íngreme. Ali a Comitiva decidiu parar e esperar
a chegada da aurora: seria inútil tentar prosseguir à noite.
Não fizeram acampamento, nem acenderam o fogo, mas ficaram deitados e encolhidos nos
barcos, que estavam ancorados uns perto dos outros.

disse Gimli, enquanto mastigava um pedaço de lembas. - Aquele foi um belo tiro no escuro,
meu amigo!
- Mas quem poderia dizer o que o tiro atingiu? - disse Legolas.
- Eu não - disse Gimli. - Mas fico feliz em pensar que a sombra não se aproximou mais.
Não gostei dela nem um pouco. Pareceu-me semelhante demais à sombra em Moria
- a sombra do balrog - finalizou ele, num sussurro.
- Não era um balrog - disse Frodo, ainda tremendo pelo frio que o assaltara. - Era algo
mais gelado. Acho que era... - Parou neste ponto, e ficou em silêncio.
- Acha o quê? - perguntou Boromir ansioso, inclinando-se em seu barco, como se tentasse
olhar o rosto de Frodo.
- Eu acho... Não, não vou dizer. O que quer que fosse, sua queda enfraqueceu nossos
inimigos.
- É o que parece - disse Aragorn. - Apesar disso, não sabemos onde estão, quantos são, e
qual será seu próximo passo. Nenhum de nós deve dormir esta noite! A escuridão
está nos escondendo agora. Mas quem pode dizer o que o dia revelará? Mantenham suas armas
ao alcance das mãos!
#414
Sam ficou sentado, tamborilando com os dedos no punho de sua espada, como se estivesse
contando alguma coisa, e olhando para o céu. - É muito estranho - murmurou
ele. - A lua é a mesma no Condado e nas Terras Ermas, ou deveria ser. Mas ou ela está
fora de seu curso, ou estou completamente errado em meus cálculos.
O senhor se lembra, Sr. Frodo, que a lua estava no quarto minguante quando estávamos
noflet em cima da árvore: uma semana depois da lua cheia, eu calculo. E ontem
fez uma semana que estamos viajando, quando apareceu uma lua nova, fina como a apara de
uma unha, como se não tivéssemos ficado tempo algum na terra dos elfos.
- Bem, eu me lembro com certeza de três noites, e tenho a impressão de lembrar de várias
outras, mas juraria que não completamos um mês de estada lá. Qualquer um
pensaria que lá o tempo não contou!
E talvez tenha sido isso mesmo - disse Frodo. - Naquela terra, talvez estivéssemos num
tempo que já se passou há muito em outros lugares. Acho que foi só quando
o Veio de Prata nos levou de volta para o Anduin que voltamos ao tempo que corre através
das terras mortais, em direção ao Grande Mar. E eu não me lembro de nenhuma
lua, velha ou nova, em Caras Galadhon: só estrelas à noite, e sol de dia.
Legolas se mexeu em seu barco. - Não, o tempo não para nunca - disse ele -,
mas a mudança e o crescimento não se manifestam em todos os seres da mesma forma. Para
os elfos, o mundo se move, e move-se ao mesmo tempo muito depressa e muito devagar.
Depressa, porque eles próprios mudam muito pouco, e todo o resto se esvai: é
uma tristeza para eles. Devagar, porque eles não contam os anos que passam, não em
relação a si mesmos. As estações que se sucedem não passam de ondas repetidas
na longa correnteza. Apesar disso, tudo sob o sol deve passar e chegar ao seu fim.
- Mas as coisas passam devagar em Lórien - disse Frodo. - O poder da Senhora age sobre
aquela terra. As horas são ricas, embora pareçam curtas, em Caras Galadhon,
onde Galadriel detém o Anel Élfico.
- Isso não deveria ser dito fora de Lórien, nem mesmo para mim! disse Aragorn. - Não fale
mais desse assunto! Mas é assim, Sam: naquela terra você perdeu as contas.
Ali o tempo passou rapidamente por nós, como passa para os elfos. A lua velha passou e
uma lua nova cresceu e minguou no
mundo de fora, enquanto permanecemos lá.
E anteontem uma lua nova apareceu outra vez. O inverno já quase passou.
O tempo corre para uma primavera de pouca esperança.
A noite passou em silêncio. Nenhuma voz ou chamado foram ouvidos outra vez do outro lado
do Rio. Os viajantes, encolhidos nos barcos, sentiam a mudança de clima.
O ar ficou quente e parado sob as grandes nuvens úmidas que flutuavam no céu, vindas do
Sul e dos mares distantes.
O fluxo

da água sobre as pedras na correnteza pareceu ficar mais ruidoso e proximo. Os galhos das
árvores começaram a pingar.
Ao romper do dia, o mundo em volta deles tinha ficado suave e triste. Lentamente, a
aurora deu lugar a uma luz clara, difusa e sem sombras. Uma névoa cobria o rio,
e não se podia enxergar a outra margem.
Não suporto nevoeiros - disse Sam -, mas este parece nos trazer sorte. Agora talvez
possamos sair daqui sem que aqueles orcs desgraçados nos vejam.
- Talvez sim - disse Aragorn. - Mas será dificil encontrar a trilha, a não ser que o
nevoeiro suba um pouco, mais tarde. E precisamos achar a trilha, se vamos passar
as Sarn Gebir e chegar aos Emyn Muil.
Não vejo por que precisamos passar pelas Corredeiras ou seguir o Rio por mais tempo disse Boromir. - Se os Emyn Muil estão à nossa frente, podemos abandonar esses
barquinhos, e avançar para o Oeste e para o Sul, até chegarmos ao Entágua, que podemos
atravessar chegando assim à minha terra.
Podemos, se estivermos indo para Minas Tirith - disse Aragorn. Mas isso ainda não foi
decidido. E um caminho desses pode ser mais perigoso do que parece.
O vale do Entágua é plano e pantanoso, e o nevoeiro é um perigo mortal para os que
estão a pé e carregando coisas. Eu não abandonaria nossos barcos até que fosse
necessário.
Pelo menos, o Rio é uma trilha que não se perde.
- Mas o Inim igo se apoderou da margem Leste - objetou Boromir. E mesmo que voce passe
os Portões dos Argonath e chegue ileso à Rocha do Espigão, que vai fazer
depois? Saltar sobre as cachoeiras e pousar nos pântanos?
Não! - respondeu Aragorn. - Em vez disso, diga que iremos levar nossos barcos pelo
caminho antigo até os pés de Rauros, e ali continuar pela água. Você não conhece,
Boromir, ou decidiu esquecer a Escada Norte e o alto trono sobre o Amon Hen, que foram
feitos nos dias dos grandes Reis? Eu, pelo menos, pretendo subir àquele lugar
alto outra vez, antes de decidir meu roteiro futuro. Ali, talvez possamos ver algum sinal
que nos guie.
Boromir relutou muito em aceitar essa escolha; mas quando ficou claro que Frodo seguiria
Aragorn, aonde quer que este fosse, acabou cedendo. - Não é costume dos
homens de Minas Tirith abandonar seus amigos necessitados - disse ele. - E voces vão
precisar de minha força, se chegarem à Rocha do Espigão. Irei até a alta ilha,
mas não além daquele ponto. Ali rumarei para meu lar; sozinho, se minha ajuda não
angariar a recompensa de algum companheirismo.
O dia avançava e o nevoeiro tinha subido um pouco. Decidiu-se que Aragorn e Legolas
deveriam avançar imediatamente ao longo da margem,
#416
enquanto os outros permaneceriam perto dos barcos. Aragorn esperava encontrar algum
caminho pelo qual pudessem ir, carregando os barcos e a bagagem, até atingir
as águas mais calmas além das Corredeiras.
- Os barcos dos elfos não afundam, talvez - disse ele. - Mas isso não quer dizer que
poderíamos atravessar as Sarn Gebir a salvo. Ninguém jamais fez isso. Nenhuma
estrada foi feita pelos homens de Gondor nesta região, pois mesmo nos dias gloriosos seu
reinado só subia o Anduin até os Emyn Muil. Mas há uma passagem em algum
lugar da margem Oeste, e espero poder encontrá-la. Não pode estar destruída, pois barcos
leves costumavam viajar saindo das Terras Ermas, descendo até Osgiliath,
e ainda faziam isto há alguns anos, quando os orcs de Mordor começaram a se multiplicar.
- Raramente vi em minha vida um barco vindo do Norte, e os orcs espreitam na praia Leste
- disse Boromir. - Se você for em frente, o perigo ficará maior a cada milha,
mesmo que consiga encontrar um caminho.
- O perigo nos espera em todas as estradas que conduzem ao Sul - respondeu Aragorn. Esperem-nos por um dia. Se não voltarmos nesse prazo, saberão que de fato o
mal nos atingiu. Então devem escolher outro líder e segui-lo da melhor maneira possível.

Foi com o coração pesado que Frodo viu Aragorn e Legolas subindo a margem íngreme e
desaparecendo dentro da névoa, mas seus temores se mostraram infundados. Apenas
duas ou três horas tinham-se passado, e mal chegava o meio-dia, quando as figuras
sombrias dos exploradores apareceram outra vez.
- Está tudo bem - disse Aragorn, descendo a margem. - Há uma trílha que leva a um bom
porto que ainda é utilizável. A distância não é grande: a cabeceira das Corredeiras
está a meia milha abaixo de nós, e elas têm apenas uma milha de comprimento, Não muito
além delas a água se torna límpida e calma de novo, embora continue correndo
veloz. Nossa tarefa mais dificil será levar os barcos e a bagagem através da antiga
passagem. Nós a encontramos, mas ela fica a uma boa distância desta margem, e
prossegue protegida por uma parede rochosa, cerca de duzentos metros ou mais da margem. E
nós não encontramos o ancoradouro Norte. Se é que ainda existe, devemos
ter passado por ele ontem à noite. Podemos ter muito trabalho para remar correnteza acima
e mesmo assim não encontrá-lo por causa do nevoeiro. Receio que devamos
abandonar o Rio agora, e nos dirigir para essa passagem da melhor forma que conseguirmos.
- Isso não seria fácil, mesmo que todos fôssemos homens - disse Boromir.
- Mesmo assim, vamos tentar, sendo todos homens ou não - disse Aragorn,
- Vamos, sim - disse Gimli. - As pernas de um homem ficam para trás
#417
numa estrada dificil, enquanto um anão continua, mesmo que o peso que carrega seja duas
vezes maior que o do seu próprio corpo,
mestre Boromir!
A tarefa acabou se revelando realmente dificil, mas no fim foi desempenhada. Os
mantimentos e bagagens foram retirados dos barcos e
trazidos ao topo da margem,
onde havia um espaço plano. Depois os barcos foram arrastados para fora da água e
carregados. Eram muito menos pesados do que qualquer um esperara. Nem mesmo Legolas
poderia dizer de que árvore cultivada na terra dos elfos eles eram feitos; mas a madeira
era resistente e, apesar disso, estranhamente leve. Merry e Pippin conseguiram,
sozinhos, carregar seu barco ao longo da planície. Não obstante, era preciso a força de
dois homens para levantar e arrastar os barcos pelo terreno que agora a Comitiva
deveria atravessar. O caminho subia, distanciando-se do Rio: uma região deserta, de
pedras calcáreas cinzentas, com muitos buracos escondidos pelo mato e pelos arbustos;
havia moitas de espinheiros, e pequenos vales abruptos; aqui e ali encontravam-se poças
lamacentas alimentadas pelas águas que desciam dos planaltos na região mais
interna.
Boromir e Aragorn carregaram os barcos um de cada vez, enquanto os outros iam aos
tropeços atrás deles, levando a bagagem. Finalmente tudo foi transportado e colocado
na passagem. Então, sem muita dificuldade, a não ser por urzais espalhados e muitas
rochas caídas, foram indo para frente, todos juntos.
O nevoeiro ainda pairava em véus sobre a parede rochosa que se desfazia, e à esquerda
a névoa escondia o Rio: eles ouviam suas águas correndo e espumando sobre os escolhos
pontudos e os
dentes de pedra das Sarn Gebir, mas não conseguiam vê-lo. Tiveram de fazer duas viagens,
antes que tudo fosse trazido a salvo para o ancoradouro Sul.
Nesse ponto a passagem, voltando de novo em direção à beira do Rio, descia suavemente até
a borda rasa de um pequeno lago. Parecia ter sido cavado na margem do Rio,
não manualmente, mas pela própria água que descia em rodamoinho das Sarn Gebir e batia
contra um ancoradouro baixo e rochoso que avançava para dentro da correnteza.
Mais adiante, a praia se transformava abruptamente num penhasco cinzento, e não havia
mais passagem para os que fossem a pé.
A tarde curta já passara e um crepúsculo apagado e nublado se formava. Sentaram-se perto
da água, escutando o rugido rápido e confuso das Corredeiras escondidas
na névoa; estavam cansados e sonolentos, e tinham os corações melancólicos como o dia que
morria.
- Bem, aqui estamos, e aqui passaremos mais uma noite - disse Boromir. - Precisamos
dormir, e mesmo que Aragorn pretendesse atravessar os Portões dos Argonath à
noite, estamos todos cansados demais - exceto, sem dúvida, nosso vigoroso anao.

Gimli não respondeu. Estava caindo no sono ali mesmo, sentado.
- Vamos descansar o máximo possível agora - disse Aragorn. - Amanhã devemos viajar
durante o dia outra vez. A não ser que o tempo mude de novo e nos engane, teremos
uma boa chance de escapar sem sermos vistos por quaisquer olhos na praia Leste. Mas esta
noite dois devem montar guarda juntos, fazendo revezamento: três horas de
descanso e uma de plantão.
Naquela noite, não aconteceu nada pior que um chuvisqueiro rápido, uma hora antes do
nascer do dia. Logo que estava completamente claro, eles partiram.
O nevoeiro já ficava menos denso. A Comitiva mantinha-se o mais perto possível da
margem Oeste, e assim podiam ver as formas apagadas dos penhascos baixos subindo cada vez
mais, paredes sombrias que tinham os pés afundados no rio veloz. No meio da manhã, as
nuvens desceram, e começou uma chuva forte. Cobriram os barcos com peles, para
evitar que se alagassem, e continuaram; através daquela cortina cinzenta que caía, quase
nada podiam ver à frente ou em volta.
Entretanto, a chuva não durou muito. Lentamente, o céu foi ficando mais leve e, de
repente, as nuvens se desmancharam, e suas franjas soltas rumaram para longe,
subindo o Rio para o Norte. O nevoeiro desapareceu. Diante dos viajantes abria-se uma
garganta larga, com grandes encostas rochosas às quais se agarravam, em saliências
e fendas estreitas, algumas árvores retorcidas. O canal ficou mais estreito e o Rio mais
rápido. Agora iam depressa acompanhando a margem, com pouca esperança de
parar ou desviar, não importava o que encontrassem à frente. Sobre eles via-se uma
alameda de céu azul-claro; ao redor deles, o Rio escuro e ensombreado; adiante,
negras, vedando o sol, as colinas de Emyn Muil, nas quais não se via qualquer abertura.
Frodo, olhando para a frente, viu na distância duas grandes rochas se aproximando:
pareciam dois grandes pináculos ou pilares de pedra. Altos, íngremes e agourentos,
erguiam-se dos dois lados da correnteza. Uma pequena abertura apareceu entre eles, e o
Rio levou os barcos naquela direção.
- Olhem os Argonath, os Pilares dos Reis! - gritou Aragorn. - Vamos passar por eles em
breve. Mantenham os barcos em fila e o mais separados que puderem. Fiquem
no meio da correnteza.
Quando Frodo foi levado na direção deles, os grandes pilares assomaram como torres vindo
ao seu encontro. Pareciam-lhe dois gigantes, figuras grandes e cinzentas,
silenciosas mas ameaçadoras. Então percebeu que de fato eram desenhados e moldados: o
trabalho e o poder de antigamente tinham trabalhado neles, que ainda conservavam,
através do sol e da chuva de anos esquecidos, as formas poderosas da escultura original.
Sobre grandes pedestais alicerçados nas águas profundas, erguiam-se dois
#419
grandes reis de pedra: ainda, com olhos turvos e cenhos gretados, voltavam-se para
o Norte. A mão esquerda de cada um deles estava levantada, com a palma para fora, num
gesto de advertência, e cada mão direita empunhava um machado; sobre cada uma das cabeças
viam-se um elmo e uma coroa, já se desintegrando. Guardiões
silenciosos de um reino há muito desaparecido, tinham ainda grande força e majestade.
Dominado pelo medo e pela admiração, Frodo se encolheu, fechando os olhos e
não ousando olhar para cima, enquanto o barco se aproximava. Até Boromir abaixou a cabeça
quando os barcos passaram, frágeis e fugazes como pequenas folhas, sob
a sombra duradoura dos guardiões de Númenor. Assim atravessaram a fenda negra dos
Portões.
Os aterrorizantes penhascos se erguiam de ambos os lados a alturas incalculáveis. Lá
adiante estava o céu pálido. As águas negras rugiam e reverberavam, e um vento
gritava sobre eles. Frodo, agachado sobre os joelhos, escutou Sam, resmungando e gemendo
à sua frente: - Que lugar! Que lugar horrível! Se me deixarem sair deste
barco, nunca mais vou molhar meus pés numa poça outra vez, muito menos num rio!
- Não tenha medo! - disse uma voz estranha atrás dele. Frodo se voltou e viu Passolargo,
que ao mesmo tempo não era Passolargo, pois o guardião marcado pelo tempo

não estava mais lá. Na popa estava Aragorn, filho de Arathorn, imponente e ereto, guiando
o barco com movimentos habilidosos; seu capuz jogado para trás, e os cabelos
negros esvoaçando no vento, uma luz em seus olhos: um rei retornando do exílio à sua
própria terra.
- Não tema! - disse ele. - Por muito tempo quis contemplar as figuras de Isildur e
Anárion, meus antepassados. Sob suas sombras Elessar, a Pedra Élfica, filho de
Arathorn da Casa de Valandil, Filho de Isildur, herdeiro de Elendil, nada tem a temer!
Então a luz em seus olhos se apagou, e ele falou para si mesmo: Como queria que Gandalf
estivesse aqui! Como meu coração anseia por Minas Anor e pelas muralhas de
minha própria cidade! Mas para onde devo ir agora?
A fenda era comprida e escura, e repleta do ruído do vento e da água veloz, e dos ecos
nas rochas. Inclinava-se um pouco na direção do Oeste de modo que, num primeiro
momento, tudo adiante estava escuro; mas logo Frodo viu um espaço de luz à sua frente,
sempre crescendo. Rapidamente se aproximou e de repente os barcos foram lançados
através dele, saindo para um espaço amplo e claro.
O sol, já há bastante tempo distante do meio-dia, brilhava num céu de ventania. As águas
confinadas se espalhavam dentro de um lago longo e oval, o claro Nen Hithoel,
cercado por colinas cinzentas e ingremes, cujas
#420
encostas estavam cobertas de árvores, mas cujas cabeças eram nuas, brilhando frias à luz
do sol. Na extremidade Sul estavam três picos.
O do meio se erguia um pouco à frente dos outros e se afastava deles, uma ilha nas águas
ao redor da qual o Rio estendia braços pálidos e reluzentes. Distante mas profundo,
vinha com o vento
um som ruidoso como um trovão ouvido na distância.
- Olhem o Tol Brandir! - disse Aragorn, apontando para o pico alto ao sul. - À
esquerda está o Amon Lhaw, e à direita o Amon Hen, as Colinas da Audição e da Visão.
Na época dos grandes reis, havia tronos altos sobre elas, e mantinha-se uma guarda ali.
Mas comenta-se que nenhum pé de homem ou nenhuma pata de animal jamais
tocou o Tol Brandir. Antes que a sombra da noite caia, chegaremos até eles. Ouço a voz
interminável de Rauros chamando.
A Comitiva agora descansou um pouco, flutuando para o Sul na correnteza que atravessava o
meio do lago. Comeram um pouco e depois pegaram de novo os remos e se apressaram
em seu caminho. As encostas das colinas a Oeste caíram na escuridão, e o sol ficou
redondo e vermelho. Aqui e ali,
uma estrela nebulosa aparecia. Os três picos assomavam diante deles, escurecendo
no crepúsculo. Rauros rugia com uma voz possante. A noite já se deitava sobre as águas
velozes quando os viajantes chegaram finalmente
à sombra das colinas.
O décimo dia de viagem chegava ao fim. As Terras Ermas estavam atrás deles. Agora não
podiam mais avançar sem escolher entre o caminho do Leste e o do Oeste. O último
estágio da Demanda estava diante deles.

#421
CAPíTULO X
O ROMPIMENTO DA SOCIEDADE

Aragorn conduziu-os pelo braço direito do Rio. Ali, na margem Oeste, sob a sombra do Tol
Brandir, um gramado verde corria para a água, vindo dos pés do Amon Hen.

Atrás dele subiam as primeiras encostas suaves da colina coberta de árvores, e árvores em
fila avançavam ao longo das margens sinuosas do lago. Uma pequena nascente
caía encosta abaixo, alimentando a relva.
- Descansaremos aqui esta noite - disse Aragorn. - Este é o gramado de Parth Galen: um
belo lugar nos dias de verão de antigamente. Esperemos que ainda nenhum mal
tenha chegado até aqui.
Arrastaram os barcos através dos verdes barrancos das margens e ao lado deles montaram
acampamento. Montaram guarda, mas não ouviram nem viram sinais dos inimigos.
Se Gollum tivera êxito em segui-los, permanecia escondido e em silêncio. Apesar disso, à
medida que a noite avançava, Aragorn foi ficando inquieto, freqüentemente
se agitando durante o sono e acordando. Durante a madrugada, levantou-se e veio até
Frodo, que estava encarregado da guarda.
Por que está acordado? - perguntou Frodo. - Não é o seu turno. Não sei - respondeu
Aragorn -; mas uma sombra ameaçadora esteve crescendo durante meu sono. Seria
bom que você puxasse sua espada.
- Por quê? - perguntou Frodo. - Há inimigos por perto?
- Vamos ver o que Ferroada tem a nos dizer - respondeu Aragorn. Frodo então puxou a
lâmina élfica de sua bainha. Para seu assombro, as bordas emitiram um brilho
fraco na noite. - Orcs! - disse ele. - Não muito perto, e ao mesmo tempo perto demais, ao
que parece!
- Receava que fosse assim - disse Aragorn. - Mas talvez não estejam deste lado do Rio. A
luz em Ferroada está fraca, e pode ser que esteja apontando apenas para
espiões de Mordor perambulando pelas encostas do Amon Lhaw. Nunca ouvi falar de
orcs sobre o Amon Hen. Mas quem sabe o que pode acontecer nesses dias maus, agora
que Minas Tirith deixou de manter ,seguras as passagens do Anduin? Devemos prosseguir com
cautela amanhã.
O dia chegou como fogo e fumaça. No Leste, viam-se camadas negras de nuvens baixas,
semelhantes à fumaça de um grande incêndio. O sol que se levantava as iluminava
por baixo com chamas de um vermelho obscuro, mas logo subiu acima delas para o céu limpo.
O pico do Tol Brandir estava
#422
coberto de ouro. Frodo olhou para o Leste e ficou observando aquela ilha imponente,
que emergia íngreme da água corrente. Bem acima dos altos penhascos ficavam encostas
escarpadas galgadas por árvores, cujas copas se sobrepunham umas às outras; mais acima
ainda ficavam paredões cinzentos de rochas inacessíveis, coroadas por um grande
pináculo de pedra. Muitos pássaros voavam em círculos ao redor dele, mas não se via
qualquer outro sinal de seres vivos.
Depois que todos haviam comido, Aragorn reuniu a Comitiva. - Finalmente o dia chegou disse ele. - O dia da escolha que adiamos por tanto tempo. Que será agora
de nossa Comitiva, que viajou até aqui como uma sociedade. Devemos rumar para o Oeste com
Boromir e nos dirigir para as guerras de Gondor, ou rumar para o Leste
em direção ao Medo e à Sombra; ou devemos ainda romper nossa sociedade e ir por este ou
aquele caminho, como cada um escolher?
O que quer que façamos deve ser feito logo, Não podemos permanecer aqui por muito
tempo. Sabemos que o inimigo está na margem Leste, mas receio que os
orcs possam já estar deste lado do Rio.
Fez-se um longo silêncio, durante o qual ninguém disse nada ou se mexeu.
- Bem, Frodo - disse Aragorn por fim. - Receio que o fardo recaia sobre seus ombros. Você
é o Portador, nomeado pelo Conselho. Só você pode escolher seu próprio
caminho. Neste assunto, não posso aconselhá-lo, Não sou Gandalf, e embora tenha tentado
desempenhar o papel dele, não sei que desígnio ou desejo ele tinha para este
momento, se é que na verdade tínha algum. Parece mais provável que, mesmo que ele
estivesse aqui agora, a escolha ainda seria sua. É o seu destino.
Frodo não respondeu de imediato. Depois falou devagar. - Sei que precisamos nos apressar,
e mesmo assim não consigo fazer uma
escolha.

O fardo é pesado. Dê-me mais uma hora, e então falarei. Deixem-me sozinho.
Aragorn olhou-o com pena e carinho. - Muito bem, Frodo, filho de Drogo - disse ele. Você terá sua hora, e ficará sozinho. Vamos ficar aqui por um tempo. Mas
não se perca e nem se afaste demais.
Frodo ficou sentado por um momento, com a cabeça abaixada. Sam, que estivera observando
seu patrão com grande preocupação, balançou a cabeça e murmurou : - Está
tudo claro como água, mas não seria bom Sam Gamgi meter o bedelho neste
momento.
Naquele instante, Frodo levantou-se e se distanciou, Sam viu que, enquanto os outros se
contiveram e não olharam para ele, os olhos de
Boromir o seguiram atentamente, até que ele sumisse de vista por entre as árvores ao pé
do Amon Hen.
Vagando sem destino pela floresta, no início, Frodo percebeu que seus pés o conduziam
para as encostas da colina. Encontrou uma trilha, as
ruínas
#423
de uma antiga estrada que estava desaparecendo. Em lugares escarpados, degraus tinham
sido feitos na pedra, mas agora estavam partidos e gastos, rachados pelas
raizes das árvores. Subiu um trecho, sem se Preocupar com que caminho tomava, até que
chegou a um lugar gramado. Sorveiras cresciam ao redor, e no meio havia uma
rocha ampla e plana. O pequeno trecho gramado e elevado se abria para o Leste e estava
agora repleto da luz do sol da manhã. Frodo parou e olhou por sobre o Rio,
muito abaixo dele, para o Tol Brandir e os pássaros desenhando círculos no grande abismo
de ar entre ele e a ilha que jamais fora pisada. A voz de Rauros era um
ronco poderoso misturado a um estrondo profundo e pulsante.
Sentou-se na pedra e apoiou o queixo nas mãos, olhando para o Leste e vendo pouca coisa
ao redor, Tudo o que acontecera desde que Bilbo deixara o Condado passava
através de sua mente, e ele lembrava e ponderava tudo o que podia recordar das palavras
de Gandalf.
O tempo passava, e ainda assim Frodo não chegava perto de nenhuma escolha.
De repente, ele acordou de seu devaneio: teve a estranha sensação de que havia alguma
coisa atrás dele, de que olhos hostis estavam sobre ele, mas para sua surpresa,
tudo o que viu foi Boromir, com um rosto sorridente e gentil.
- Estava preocupado com você, Frodo - disse ele, chegando mais perto. Se Aragorn tem
razão e os orcs estiverem nas proximidades, então nenhum de nós deve vagar
sozinho, e você menos ainda: muita coisa depende de você. E meu coração também está
pesado. Posso ficar agora e conversar um pouco,já que o encontrei? Isso me consolaria.
Onde há muita gente, qualquer conversa se torna um debate sem fim. Mas duas pessoas
juntas Podem talvez encontrar a sabedoria.
- Você é gentil - respondeu Frodo. - Mas não acho que conversa alguma possa me ajudar.
Pois sei o que devo fazer, mas tenho medo de fazê-lo, Boromir: tenho medo.
Boromir ficou em silêncio. As Cataratas de Rauros continuavam rugindo infinitamente.
O vento murmurava nos galhos das árvores. Frodo tremeu. De repente, Boromir se aproximou
e sentou-se ao lado dele. - Tem
certeza de que não está sofrendo sem necessidade? - disse ele. - Quero ajudá-lo. Você
precisa de um conselho nessa dificil escolha. Aceita o meu?
-Acho que já sei que tipo de conselho você vai me oferecer, Boromir
- disse Frodo. - E eu poderia considerá-lo um sábio conselho, se não fosse pela
advertência do meu coração.
- Advertência? Advertência contra quê? - disse Boromir abruptamente.
- Contra a demora. Contra o caminho que parece mais fácil. Contra a recusa do fardo que é
colocado sobre meus ombros. Contra.- Bem, é melhor que eu diga, contra
a confiança na força e na sinceridade dos homens.

- Apesar disso, essa força vem por muito tempo protegendo vocês em seu pequeno país,
embora não soubessem disso.
- Não duvido do valor de seu povo. Mas o mundo está mudando. As muralhas de Minas Tiríth
podem ser fortes, mas não são fortes o suficiente. Se não agüentarem, o
que pode acontecer?
- Pereceremos na batalha, valorosamente. Mas ainda existe esperança de que elas agüentem.
- Não há esperança enquanto o Anel continuar existindo - disse Frodo.
- Ah! O Anel - disse Boromir, com os olhos faiscando. - O Anel! Não é um destino estranho
nós sofrermos tanto medo e dúvida por uma coisa tão pequena? Uma coisa
tão pequena! E eu o vi apenas por um instante na Casa de Elrond. Poderia vê-lo um pouco
outra vez?
Frodo levantou os olhos. De repente, seu coração gelou. Captou o brilho estranho no olhar
de Boromir, apesar de seu rosto ainda se manter gentil e amigável. - É
melhor que ele fique escondido - respondeu ele.
- Como quiser. Não me preocupo - disse Boromir. - Mas não posso nem falar dele? Pois você
parece estar sempre pensando só no poder do Anel nas mãos do Inimigo: em
seus usos maléficos, e não nos bons. O mundo está mudando, você diz. Minas Tirith vai
perecer, se o Anel perdurar. Mas por quê? Certamente seria assim se o Anel
estivesse com o Inimigo. Mas por quê, se estivesse conosco?
- Você não estava no Conselho? - respondeu Frodo. - Porque não podemos usá-lo, e porque o
que é feito com ele se transforma em maleficio. Boromir levantou-se e ficou
andando de um lado para outro, impaciente. - Você continua dizendo isso - exclamou
ele. - Gandalf, Elrond... todos esses lhe ensinaram a falar desse modo. Em relação a eles
próprios, podem estar certos.
Esses elfos e meio-elfos e magos, eles talvez fracassassem. Apesar disso, ainda tenho
dúvidas se são sábios, e não apenas tímidos. Mas cada um é do seu modo. Homens
de coração sincero, estes não serão corrompidos. Nós, de Minas Tirith, temos permanecido
firmes através de longos anos de provações. Não desejamos o poder dos senhores
dos magos, só a força para nos defendermos, a força numa causa justa. E veja! em nossa
necessidade, o acaso traz à luz o Anel de Poder. É uma dádiva, eu digo; uma
dádiva aos inimigos de Mordor. É loucura não fazer uso dela, não usar o poder do Inimigo
contra ele mesmo. Os corajosos, os destemidos, só estes conseguirão a vitória.
O que não poderia fazer um guerreiro nesta hora, um grande líder? O que Aragorn não
poderia fazer? Ou, se ele se recusar, por que não Boromir? O Anel poderia me
dar poder de Comando. Como eu poderia rechaçar os exércitos de Mordor, e todos os homens
seguiriam minha bandeira!
Boromir andava para cima e para baixo, falando cada vez mais alto. Parecia quase que
tinha esquecido de Frodo, enquanto sua fala se detinha em muralhas e armas,
e no ajuntamento de tropas de homens; fazia planos
#425
para grandes alianças e gloriosas vitórias futuras; e destruía Mordor e se tornava um rei
poderoso, benevolente e sábio. De repente, parou e agitou os braços.
- E eles nos dizem para jogá-lo fora! - gritou ele. - Não digo destruílo. Isso seria bom,
se racionalmente pudéssemos ter alguma esperança de fazê-lo. Mas não podemos.
O único plano proposto é que um pequeno deva andar cegamente para dentro de Mordor e
oferecer ao Inimigo todas as chances de recapturá-lo. Loucura!
- Certamente você está entendendo, meu amigo? - disse ele, voltando-se agora de repente
para Frodo outra vez. - Você diz que está com medo. Se é assim, os mais corajosos
devem perdoá-lo. Mas não seria na verdade o seu bom senso que se revolta?
- Não, estou com medo - disse Frodo. - Simplesmente com medo. Mas estou feliz por ter
ouvido você falar tão abertamente. Minha mente agora está menos confusa.
- Então você virá para Minas Tirith? - gritou Boromir, com os olhos brilhando e o rosto
ansioso.
- Você não está me entendendo - disse Frodo.
- Mas você virá, pelo menos por um tempo? - persistiu Boromir. Minha cidade não está
longe agora, e a distância de lá até Mordor é um pouco maior do que se partíssemos

daqui. Faz tempo que estamos viajando por lugares desertos, e você precisa saber o que o
Inimigo está fazendo antes de tomar uma decisão. Venha comigo, Frodo - disse
ele. - Você precisa descansar antes de sua aventura, se é que precisa mesmo ir. - Colocou
a mão no ombro do hobbit de um modo amigável, mas Frodo sentiu a mão tremendo
com uma agitação contida. Deu um passo abrupto para trás, e olhou alarmado para aquele
homem alto, com quase o dobro de seu tamanho e muitas vezes mais forte que
ele.
- Por que essa hostilidade? - perguntou Boromir. - Sou um homem sincero. Não sou ladrão
nem perseguidor. Preciso de seu Anel: agora você já sabe; mas dou-lhe minha
palavra de que não pretendo ficar com ele. Você não permitiria pelo menos que eu tentasse
pôr em prática meu plano? Empreste-me o Anel!
Não! Não! - gritou Frodo. - O Conselho designou-me como Portador.
É por nossa própria tolice que o Inimigo vai nos derrotar - gritou Boromir. - Isso
me enfurece!
Tolo! Tolo obstinado! Correndo de livre e espontânea vontade em direção à morte, e
arruinando nossa causa. Se algum mortal tem o direito de reivindicar o Anel, esse
direito pertence aos homens de Númenor, e não aos pequenos. O direito não é seu, exceto
por um acaso infeliz, Podia ter sido meu. Devia ser meu. Dê-me o Anel!
Frodo não respondeu, mas se afastou até que a grande pedra plana ficasse entre eles. Vamos, vamos, meu amigo! - disse Boromir numa voz
#426
mais suave. - Por que não se livrar dele? Por que não se libertar de sua dúvida e de seu
medo? Você pode colocar a culpa em mim, se quiser. Pode dizer que eu sou
forte demais e o tomei à força. Porque eu sou forte demais para você, pequeno - gritou
ele, e de repente subiu na pedra e saltou sobre Frodo. Seu rosto belo e agradável
estava terrivelmente transformado; um fogo feroz lhe queimava os olhos.
Frodo recuou e outra vez a pedra ficou entre os dois. Só havia uma coisa a fazer:
tremendo, tirou o Anel da corrente e colocou-o depressa no dedo, no exato momento
em que Boromir saltava de novo em sua direção.
O homem ficou atônito, olhando surpreso por um momento, e depois correu em volta do
lugar, ensandecido, procurando aqui e ali por entre as rochas e árvores.
- Trapaceiro miserável! - gritou ele. - Deixe-me colocar as mãos em você! Agora entendo o
que pretende. Levará o Anel para Sauron e nos venderá a todos. Só estava
esperando uma oportunidade para nos deixar em apuros. Almaldiçôo você e todos os pequenos
com a morte e a escuridão! Então, tropeçando numa pedra, caiu e esparramou-se
de rosto no chão. Por um momento, ficou parado como se sua própria praga o tivesse
atingido; depois, de repente, começou a chorar.
Levantou-se passando a mão nos olhos, limpando as lágrimas. - O que eu disse? - gritou
ele. - O que eu fiz? Frodo, Frodo! - chamou ele. - Volte!
Uma loucura tomou conta de mim, mas já passou. Volte!
Não houve resposta. Frodo nem ouviu seus gritos. Já estava longe, saltando cegamente pela
trilha, em direção ao topo da colina. Estava atormentado de pavor e tristeza,
vendo em pensamento o rosto louco e enfurecido de Boromir, e seus olhos flamejantes.
Logo já estava no topo do Amon Hen, e parou, tomando fôlego. Enxergou, como se através de
uma névoa, um círculo amplo e plano, com um pavimento de lajes enormes
e cercado por um parapeito em ruínas. No centro, instalada sobre quatro pilares
esculpidos, estava uma cadeira alta, à qual se chegava por uma escada de muitos degraus.
Subiu e sentou-se na antiga cadeira, como uma criança perdida que tivesse escalado o
trono dos reis das montanhas.
No início, conseguiu ver pouca coisa. Parecia estar num mundo de névoa no qual só havia
sombras: o Anel agia sobre ele. Então, aqui e ali a névoa cedeu e ele viu
muitas imagens: pequenas e nítidas como se estivessem sob seus olhos numa mesa, e ao
mesmo tempo remotas. Não havia sons, so imagens claras e vívidas. Parecia que
o mundo tinha encolhido e silenciado. Ele estava sobre o Trono da Visão no Amon Hen, a
Colina do Olho dos homens de Núlnenor. Ao Leste, examinou as terras selvagens
que não estavam nos mapas, planícies sem nome, e florestas inexploradas. Olhou para

o Norte e o Grande Rio jazia como uma fita embaixo dele; as Montanhas Sombrias se erguiam
pequenas e rígidas como dentes quebrados. No Oeste viu as pastagens largas
de Rohan, e Orthanc, o pináculo de Isengard, como um ferrão preto. Olhou ao Sul, e bem
abaixo de seus pés o Grande Rio se enrolava como uma onda enorme e se jogava
sobre as cachoeiras de Rauros num abismo de espuma; um arco-íris brilhante brincava na
fumaça. E viu Ethir Anduin, o grande delta do Rio, e milhares de pássaros
marinhos
rodopiando como uma poeira branca ao sol, e debaixo deles um mar verde e prateado,
encrespando-se em linhas intermináveis.
Mas em todo lugar que olhava, via sinais de guerra. As Montanhas Sombrias se agitavam
como formigueiros: orcs saíam de mil tocas. Sob os galhos da Floresta das Trevas
havia contendas mortais entre elfos e homens e animais cruéis. A terra dos beornings
estava em chamas; uma nuvem cobria Moria; fumaça subia das fronteiras de Lórien.
Cavaleiros galopavam sobre a relva de Rohan; de Isengard jorravam lobos. Dos portos de
Harad, navios de guerra saíam para o mar; e do Oeste saíam homens sem parar:
espadachins, lanceiros, arqueiros, carruagens levando líderes e carroças carregadas. Todo
o poder do Senhor do Escuro estava em ação. Então, voltando-se de novo
para o Sul, Frodo viu Minas Tirith. Parecia distante e bela: com muralhas brancas, muitas
torres, majestosa e linda sobre sua montanha; seus parapeitos reluziam
como aço, e suas torres brilhavam com muitas bandeiras. A esperança renasceu em seu
coração. Mas contra Minas Tirith erguia-se outra fortaleza, maior e mais forte.
Sentiu que seu olhar se dirigia para o Leste, sendo atraído contra sua vontade. Passou
pelas pontes arruinadas de
Osgiliath, pelos portões escancarados de Minas
Morgul e pelas Montanhas assombradas, detendo-se sobre Gorgoroth, o vale do terror na
Terra de Mordor. Lá a escuridão jazia sob o sol.
O fogo reluzia em meio à fumaça.
A Montanha da Perdição queimava e um cheiro insuportável empesteava o ar. Então,
finalmente, seu olhar foi detido: muralhas e mais muralhas, parapeito sobre parapeito,
negra, incomensuravelmente forte, montanha de ferro, portão de aço, torre de diamante,
ele a viu: Barad-dúr, a Fortaleza de Sauron. Perdeu todas as esperanças.
E, de repente, sentiu o Olho. Havia um olho na Torre Escura que nunca dormia. Frodo sabia
que ele tinha percebido seu olhar. Uma determinação feroz e ávida estava
nele. Saltou na direção de Frodo, que quase como um dedo o sentiu, procurando-o. Muito em
breve iria tocá-lo e saber exatamente onde estava. Tocou Amon Lhaw. Olhou
sobre Tol Brandir - Frodo se jogou da cadeira, agachado, cobrindo a cabeça com seu capuz
cinzento.
Ouviu-se dizendo: Nunca, nunca! Ou seria: Sim, eu irei, irei até você? Não saberia dizer.
Então, como um relâmpago, de algum outro ponto de poder veio à sua mente
um outro pensamento: Tire-o! Tire-o! Tolo, tire-o. Tire o Anel!
#428
As duas forças lutavam nele. Por um momento, perfeitamente equilibrado entre os dois
pontos agudos, ele se debateu, atormentado. De repente tomou consciência de
si próprio outra vez. Frodo; nem a Voz, nem o Olho: livre para escolher, e lhe sobrava um
único instante para fazê-lo. Tirou o Anel do dedo. Viu-se ajoelhado em
plena luz do sol diante do alto trono. Uma sombra negra pareceu passar sobre ele como um
braço; não atingiu o Amon Hen e continuou tateando na direção do Oeste,
para depois desaparecer. Então todo o céu ficou claro e azul. e os pássaros voltaram a
cantar em todas as árvores.
Frodo se levantou. Estava tomado por um grande cansaço, mas com a disposição firme e o
coração mais leve. Falou alto para si mesmo: "Farei agora o que devo", disse
ele. "Pelo menos isto está claro: a maldade do Anel já está operando até mesmo na
Comitiva, e o Anel deve abandoná-los antes que lhes cause mais danos. Irei sozinho.

Em alguns não posso confiar, e aqueles em quem confio me são muito caros: o pobre Sam, e
Merry e Pippin. Passolargo também: seu coração deseja ir para Minas Tirith,
e ele será necessário lá, agora que Boromir foi tomado pelo mal. Irei sozinho.
Imediatamente."
Desceu correndo até a trilha e voltou à relva onde Boromir o encontrara. Ali parou para
escutar. Teve a impressão de estar ouvindo gritos e chamados vindos da florestajunto
à margem lá embaixo.
#429
- "Estão me procurando", disse ele. "Pergunto-me quanto tempo fiquei ausente. Horas, eu
acho." Hesitou. "Que posso fazer"?", pensou ele. "Devo ir agora, ou não
irei nunca mais. Não terei outra oportunidade. Odeio a idéia de deixá-los, ainda mais
desta forma, sem qualquer explicação. Mas certamente irão entender. Sam entenderá.
E que mais posso fazer?"
Lentamente pegou o Anel e colocou-o no dedo outra vez. Desapareceu e desceu a colina,
fazendo menos ruído que o farfalhar do vento.
Os outros permaneceram por muito tempo perto da margem. Por um período ficaram em
silêncio, movimentando-se inquietos, mas agora estavam sentados num círculo,
conversando. De quando em quando se esforçavam para falar de Outras coisas, da longa
estrada e das Muitas aventuras que tinham vivido; faziam perguntas a Aragom
sobre o reino de Gondor e sua história antiga, e sobre os remanescentes de suas grandes
obras que ainda podiam ser vistos naquela estranha fronteira dos Emyn Muil:
dos reis de pedra e dos tronos de Lhaw e Hen, e da grande Escada ao lado da cachoeira de
Rauros. Mas toda vez seus pensamentos e palavras acabavam voltando para
Frodo e o Anel.
O que Frodo escolheria fazer? Por que estaria hesitando?
- Acho que ele está pensando qual caminho proporcionaria menos esperanças - disse
Aragorn. - E tem motivos para isso, Agora há menos esperanças do que nunca de a
Comitiva ir para o Leste, já que fomos seguidos por Gollum, e devemos temer que o segredo
de nossa jornada já tenha sido traído. Mas Minas Tirith não fica mais perto
do Fogo e da destruição do Fardo. - Podemos ficar lá algum tempo, e manter uma
resistência corajosa, mas o Senhor Denethor e seus homens não podem ter esperanças
de conseguir fazer o que até Elrond disse estar acima de seu poder: ou manter o Fardo em
segredo, ou conter toda a força do Inimigo quando ele vier buscá-lo. Que
caminho qualquer um de nós escolheria
no lugar de Frodo? Não sei. Na verdade, este momento é o que mais nos faz sentir falta de
Gandalf.
- Nossa perda foi imensa - disse Legolas. - Mesmo assim, devemos tomar uma decisão sem a
ajuda dele. Por que não podemos decidir, e dessa forma ajudar Frodo? Vamos
chamá-lo de volta e fazer uma votação! Votarei para Minas Tirith.
- Eu também - disse Gimli. - É claro que nós só fomos enviados para ajudar o Portador ao
longo da estrada, e para acompanhá-lo até o ponto que quiséssemos, e que
nenhum de nós está sob juramento ou ordem que determine que devemos procurar a Montanha
da Perdição. Foi difícil para mim a despedida de Lothlórien. Apesar disso,
cheguei até aqui, e digo o seguinte: agora que chegamos à última escolha, está claro para
mim que não posso abandonar Frodo. Eu escolherei Minas Tirith, mas se ele
não fizer a mesma escolha, vou segui-lo.
- E eu também irei com ele. - disse Legolas. - Seria desleal dizer adeus agora.
Na verdade, seria uma traição, se todos nós o abandonássemos - disse Aragorn. - Mas se
ele for para o Leste, então não é preciso que todos o acompanhem: nem eu acho
que todos deveriam. Essa aventura é desesperada: tanto para oito, para três, como para
uma única pessoa. Se me deixassem escolher, eu apontaria três companheiros:
Sam, que não suportaria se fosse de outra forma, gimli e eu. Boromir retornará a sua
propria cidade, onde seu pai e seu povo precisam dele; com ele os outros deveriam
ir, ou pelo menos Meriadoc e Peregrin, se Legolas não tiver intenções de nos abandonar.
- Isso não vai dar certo de modo algum! - gritou Merry. - Não podemos deixar Frodo!
Pippin e eu sempre quisemos acompanhá-lo aonde quer que fosse. e ainda queremos.

Mas não percebíamos o que isso significava. Tudo parecia diferente lá longe, no Condado
ou em Valfenda. Seria loucura e crueldade permitir que Frodo fosse para Mordor.
Por que não podemos detê-lo?
- Devemos detê-lo - disse Pippin. - E tenho certeza de que é isso que o preocupa. Ele
sabe que não concordaremos com sua ida para o Leste. E não lhe agrada pedir
que qualquer um de nós o acompanhe, o pobre camarada. Imagine, ir para Mordor sozinho! Pippin estremeceu. - Mas o velho e tolo hobbit tem de saber que não será
preciso pedir. Tem de saber que, se não conseguirmos detê-lo, não vamos abandoná-lo.
#430
- Desculpe-me - disse Sam. - Acho que não estão entendendo meu patrão de forma alguma.
Ele não está hesitando sobre que caminho tomar. Claro que não! Qual seria
a vantagem de Minas Tirith, de qualquer modo? Quero dizer para ele, se o senhor me
desculpa, mestre Boromir - acrescentou ele, voltando-se para trás. Foi nesse momento
que descobriram que Boromir, que primeiro estivera sentado em silêncio fora do círculo,
não estava mais lá.
- Agora, aonde ele foi? - gritou Sam, com uma expressão preocupada. - Ultimamente, estava
meio estranho, na minha opinião. Mas de qualquerjeito ele não participa
deste assunto. Está de partida para sua terra, como sempre disse; e não devemos culpá-lo
por isso. Mas o Sr. Frodo, ele tem de encontrar as Fendas da Perdição, se
puder. Mas está com medo. Agora chegamos ao ponto, ele está simplesmente apavorado. É
isso que o atrapalha. É claro que aprendeu um pouco, por assim dizer - todos
nós aprendemos - desde que deixamos nossa casa. Se não fosse por isso, estaria tão
apavorado que
simplesmente jogaria o Anel no Rio e fugiria. Mas ele ainda está amedrontado demais
para dar o primeiro passo. E não está se preocupando conosco: se vamos com ele ou não.
Ele sabe que é essa a nossa intenção. Isso é outra coisa que o está incomodando.
Se conseguir criar coragem para ir, vai querer ir sozinho. Ouçam o que digo! Vamos ter
encrenca quando ele voltar. Pois é certeza que vai criar coragem. Certo como
seu nome é Bolseiro.
- Acho que você fala com mais sabedoria que qualquer um de nós, Sam - disse Aragorn. - E
o que faremos, se você estiver com a razão?
- Detê-lo. Não deixar que parta! - gritou Pippin.
- Será? - disse Aragorn. - Ele é o Portador, e o destino do Fardo recai sobre ele. Não
acho que seja nosso papel conduzi-lo por um outro caminho. Nem acho que conseguiríamos,
mesmo que tentássemos. Há outros poderes em ação, muito mais fortes.
- Bem, gostaria que Frodo "criasse coragem" logo e voltasse, e que nos deixasse continuar
- disse Pippin. - Essa espera é terrível!
O tempo acabou, não acabou?
- Sim - disse Aragorn. - A hora já passou há muito. A manhã está terminando. Devemos
chamá-lo.
E naquele momento Boromir reapareceu. Surgiu das árvores e caminhou na direção deles sem
dizer nada. Seu rosto parecia severo e triste. Parou, como se estivesse
contando os presentes, e depois sentou-se afastado, com os olhos no chão.
- Onde esteve, Boromir? - perguntou Aragorn. - Você viu Frodo? Boromir hesitou por um
segundo. - Sim e não - respondeu ele devagar.
- Sim, encontreí-o a uma certa distância daqui, na colina, e falei com ele.
#431
implorei que viesse para Minas Tirith, e que não fosse para o Leste. Fiquei furioso e ele
me deixou. Desapareceu. Nunca em minha vida vi algo assim acontecer, embora
tenha ouvido em histórias. Ele deve ter colocado o Anel. Não consegui encontrá-lo de
novo. Pensei que voltaria para cá.
- É tudo o que tem a dizer? - disse Aragorn, olhando para Boromir com severidade e sem
muita gentileza.
- Sim - respondeu ele. - Não vou dizer mais nada por enquanto.

- Isso é mau! - gritou Sam. - Não sei o que esse homem andou fazendo. Por que o Sr. Frodo
colocaria a coisa? Não deveria precisar, e se precisou, quem sabe o que
pode ter acontecido?
- Mas ele não ficaria usando o Anel - disse Merry. - Não depois que tivesse escapado do
visitante
incovemmte, como Bilbo costumava fazer.
- Mas aonde ele foi? Onde está? - gritou Pippin. - Faz séculos que ele saiu.
- Quanto tempo faz que você viu Frodo pela última vez, Boromir? perguntou Aragorn.
- Meia hora, talvez - respondeu ele. - Ou pode ser uma hora. Vaguei por um tempo depois
disso. Não sei! Não sei! - Colocou a cabeça entre as mãos e sentou-se como
se estivesse curvado pelo peso da tristeza.
- Uma hora desde que ele desapareceu! - gritou Sam. - Devemos tentar encontrá-lo
imediatamente. Venham!
- Espere um minuto! - disse Aragorn. - Vamos nos dividir em pares, e arranjar... Ei,
esperem um pouco!
De nada adiantou. Não prestaram atenção nele. Sam tinha saído correndo primeiro. Merry e
Pippin o seguiram, e já estavam desaparecendo entre as árvores perto da
margem, ao Oeste, gritando: Frodo! Frodo! com suas vozes de hobbits, claras e agudas.
Legolas e gimli estavam correndo. Uma loucura e um pânico súbitos pareciam
ter caído sobre a Comitiva.
- Vamos todos nos dispersar e nos perder - suspirou Aragorn. - Boromir! Não sei qual foi
seu papel nessa história, mas agora ajude! Vá atrás daqueles dois jovens
hobbits, e proteja-os pelo menos, mesmo que não consigam encontrar Frodo. Voltem para
este ponto, se o encontrarem, ou se virem algum sinal dele. Volto logo.
Aragorn se afastou rapidamente, e foi à procura de Sam. Logo que atingiu o pequeno
gramado no meio das sorveiras, conseguiu alcançá-lo, subindo a colina com grande
esforço, bufando e gritando, Frodo!
- Venha comigo, Sam! - disse ele. - Nenhum de nós deve ficar sozinho. A traição está à
solta. Eu sinto isso. Estou indo para o topo, para a Cadeira do Amon Hen,
para ver o que pode ser visto. E veja! É como meu coração suspeitava, Frodo foi por aqui.
Siga-me e mantenha os olhos abertos! - Apressou-se pela trilha.
#432
Sam fez o que pôde, mas não conseguiu acompanhar Passolargo, o guardião, e logo ficou
para trás. Não tinha ido muito longe quando Aragorri já sumia de vista. Parou,
bufando. De repente, bateu a mão na cabeça!
- Ôôôôôh!, Sam Gamgi! - disse ele em voz alta. - Suas pernas são curtas demais, então use
a cabeça! Deixe-me ver agora! Boromir não está mentindo, ele não é disso;
mas não nos contou tudo. Alguma coisa assustou muito o Sr. Frodo. De repente, ele criou
coragem. Finalmente se decidiu... a ir. Para onde? Para o Leste. Não sem
o Sam? Sim, até sem levar Sam. Isso é duro. Uma crueldade!
Sam passou a mão nos olhos, limpando as lágrimas. - Fique firme, Gamji ! - disse ele. Tente pensar! Ele não pode voar sobre os rios, e não pode escalar cachoeiras.
Ele não está levando equipamento nenhum. Então vai precisar voltar aos barcos. Voltar aos
barcos! Volte aos barcos, Sam, como um raio!
Sam voltou descendo a trilha como um relâmpago. Caiu e cortou os joelhos. Levantou-se e
continuou correndo. Chegou à borda do gramado do Parth Galen perto da margem
para onde os barcos tinham sido arrastados, fora da água. Não havia ninguém ali. Teve a
impressão de ouvir gritos e chamados na floresta atrás dele, mas não lhes
deu atenção. Parou por um mometo, olhando, paralisado, bufando. Um barco estava
escorregando pela margem, sozinho. Com um grito, Sam atravessou correndo a grama.
O barco entrou na Ligua.
Estou indo, Sr. Frodo! Estou indo! - gritou Sam,jogando-se da margem e tentando se
agarrar ao barco que partia. Errou por um metro. Com um grito e esparramando água,
caiu de cara dentro do rio veloz e profundo. Afundou gorgolejando e as águas se fecharam
sobre seu cabelo encaracolado.

www.portaldetonando.cjb.net
Uma exclamação de assombro veio do barco vazio. Um remo virou e mudou a direção do barco.
Por pouco Frodo não conseguiu agarrá-lo pelo cabelo no momento em que
emergiu, soltando bolhas e lutando contra a correnteza. O medo estava estampado naqueles
olhos redondos e castanhos.
- Suba, Sam, meu rapaz! - disse Frodo. - Agora, pegue minha mão!
Salve-me, Sr. Frodo! - bufou Sam. - Estou me afogando. Não posso ver sua mão.
- Aqui está. Não precisa beliscar, rapaz! Não vou soltá-lo. Venha com cuidado e não faça
muita onda, senão o barco pode virar. Agora, segure na lateral, e deixe
que eu use o remo.
Com algumas remadas, Frodo trouxe o barco de volta para a margem, e Sam pôde pular para
dentro, molhado até os
ossos. Frodo tirou o Anel e pisou outra vez na margem.
De todos os malditos estorvos, você é o pior, Sam! - disse ele.
#433
- Ó, Sr. Frodo, isso é duro! - disse Sam tremendo. - Isso é duro, tentar ir embora sem
mim e tudo mais. Se eu não tivesse adivinhado certo, onde o senhor estaria
agora?
- A caminho e a salvo.
- A salvo! - disse Sam. - Completamente sozinho sem mim para ajudá-lo? Eu não agüentaria,
seria a morte para mim.
- Seria a morte para você ir comigo, Sam - disse Frodo. - E eu não agüentaria isso.
- Não seria uma morte tão certa quanto a de ser deixado para trás disse Sam.
- Mas estou indo para Mordor.
- Sei muito bem disso, Sr. Frodo. Claro que o senhor vai. E eu vou também.
- Agora, Sam - disse Frodo -, não me atrase! Os outros estarão de volta num minuto. Se me
pegarem aqui, terei de discutir e explicar, e nunca terei a coragem ou
a oportunidade de escapar. Mas preciso partir imediatamente. É o único jeito.
- Claro que é - disse Sam. - Mas não sozinho. Também vou, ou nenhum de nós vai. Vou
fazer buracos em todos os barcos primeiro.
Frodo riu de verdade. Um calor e uma alegria súbitos encheram-lhe o coração. - Deixe
um inteiro! - disse ele. - Vamos precisar dele. Mas você não pode vir assim,
sem seu equipamento, sem a comida e tudo mais.
Espere Só UM minuto, que vou pegar minhas coisas! - gritou Sam, ansioso. - Está tudo
pronto. Achei que partiríamos hoje. - Correu até o acampamento, pegou a mochila
da pilha em que Frodo a havia colocado quando tirou do barco as coisas de seus
companheiros, agarrou mais um cobertor, e alguns pacotes a mais de comida, e correu
de volta.
Todo o meu plano está arruinado! - disse Frodo. - Não adianta tentar escapar de você, mas
estou feliz, Sam. Não consigo dizer como estou feliz. Venha! É óbvio que
nós devíamos ir juntos. Vamos, e que os outros encontrem uma estrada segura! Passolargo
cuidará deles. Não acho que os veremos outra vez.
Mas pode ser que sim, Sr. Frodo. Pode ser que sim - disse Sam.
Assim Frodo e Sam partiram no último estágio da Demanda juntos. Frodo remou para longe da
margem, e o Rio os levou rapidamente embora, descendo o braço Oeste, passando
os penhascos sisudos do Tol Brandir.
O rugido das grandes cachoeiras se aproximou. Mesmo com a ajuda que Sam podia dar, foi
dificil atravessar a corrente na extremidade sul da ilha e levar o barco
para o Leste, em direção da outra margem.
#434
Finalmente voltaram à terra sobre as encostas Sul do Amon Lhaw. Ali encontraram uma
margem elevada e arrastaram o barco para fora, bem acima da água, escondendo-o
o melhor que podiam, atrás de um grande rochedo. Depois, de bagagem nos ombros, partiram,
procurando uma trilha que os levasse através das colinas cinzentas dos
Emyn Muil, descendo até a Terra da Sombra.

Aqui termina a primeira parte da história da Guerra do Anel.
A segunda parte se intitula AS DUAS TORRES, pois os acontecimentos que ali se narram são
dominados por ORTHANC, a cidadela de Saruman, e pelafortaleza de MINAS MORGUL,
que vigia a entrada secreta de Mordor; trata dos feitos e perigos de todos os membros da
agora dividida sociedade, até a chegada da Grande Treva.
A terceira parte trata da última resistência contra a Sombra e do fim da missão do
Portador do Anel, em
O RETORNO DO REI.
